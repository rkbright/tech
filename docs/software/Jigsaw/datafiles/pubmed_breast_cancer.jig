        <docText>Development of multilayered cell-hydrogel composites using an acoustic focusing technique.

Multilayered composites, composed of mammalian cells arranged in a hydrogel, have been prepared using an acoustic focusing technique. Acoustic focusing is a simple, nonchemical technique that allows for the fast arrangement of cells in matrices where the control of cell geometry is beneficial. Breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) were dispersed in a 30 wt % solution of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) of molecular weight 400 at a density of 5 x 10(6) cells/mL of PEGDA solution. An ultrasonic field was used to organize the cells before polymerization of PEGDA. Disk-shaped hydrogel composites, typically 1 cm in diameter and 2-mm thick were prepared based on a PEGDA solution volume of 130 muL. At an acoustic frequency of 2.32 MHz, composites having cells positioned within concentric cylindrical shells interspersed with zones of cell-free hydrogel were produced. The cells were located in annuli approximately 80-mum thick and about 300 mum apart. The structure and viability of the cells within these constructs were studied using a fluorescent LIVE/DEAD assay. The viability of the cells was on the order of 50%. For the conditions used in this study, cell death was primarily attributed to exposure of cells to the PEGDA solution prior to polymerization, rather than adverse effects of polymerization or the sound field itself.

        <docTitle>Three conformational antibodies specific for different PSMA epitopes are promising diagnostic and therapeutic tools for prostate cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Three conformational antibodies specific for different PSMA epitopes are promising diagnostic and therapeutic tools for prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: The prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents an attractive antigen for antibody-based diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer, since it is highly restricted to the prostate and overexpressed in all tumor stages. The present work describes the in vitro characterization of the three anti-PSMA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3/A12, 3/E7, and 3/F11 in comparison to the mAb J591. METHODS: The mAbs were tested for saturation and competitive binding on C4-2 prostate cancer cells by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on frozen prostate normal and cancer tissues as well as on lymph node metastases. Similarly, potential crossreactivities were tested on a broad panel of human normal tissues. RESULTS: The anti-PSMA mAbs showed a strong binding to C4-2 cells with mean half-maximal saturation concentrations of about 14 nM for 3/A12, 17 nM for 3/E7, 9 nM for 3/F11, and 16 nM for J591. Competitive binding studies revealed that our three mAbs bind to different extracellular PSMA epitopes. The mAbs showed comparable staining of epithelial cells for all tested normal and tumorous prostate tissues. Extraprostatic staining was observed on secretory cells of the salivary glands and on the brush border of the duodenal columnar epithelium. J591 additionally showed positive staining of the normal breast epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their specific binding characteristics, the anti-PSMA mAbs 3/A12, 3/E7, and 3/F11 show great promise for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in prostate cancer.

        <docText>L(1) Penalized Estimation in the Cox Proportional Hazards Model.

This article presents a novel algorithm that efficiently computes L(1) penalized (lasso) estimates of parameters in high-dimensional models. The lasso has the property that it simultaneously performs variable selection and shrinkage, which makes it very useful for finding interpretable prediction rules in high-dimensional data. The new algorithm is based on a combination of gradient ascent optimization with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. It is described for a general likelihood function and can be applied in generalized linear models and other models with an L(1) penalty. The algorithm is demonstrated in the Cox proportional hazards model, predicting survival of breast cancer patients using gene expression data, and its performance is compared with competing approaches. An R package, penalized, that implements the method, is available on CRAN.</docText>

        <docText>Excision of axillary lymph node recurrences in breast cancer patients with axillary ROLL (A-ROLL).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Conventional surgical exploration to find clinically occult axillary lymph node recurrence of breast cancer can be challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the place of our alternative technique, axillary-ROLL (A-ROLL), in previously treated breast cancer patients with nonpalpable axillary lymph node recurrences. METHODS: Between March 2005 and May 2009, included in this retrospective study were four women (age, 42-51 years) without clinical evidence of distant metastasis who had treatment for breast cancer and were subsequently found to have suspicious axillary lymph node(s) detected by control ultrasonography (US) examination during follow-up. A-ROLL was utilized for the identification of lymph nodes. 0.5-1 mCi (99m)Tc-human serum albumin makroaggregate was injected under US guidance. A gamma probe was then used to guide the excision of the lymph nodes. RESULTS: The involved lymph nodes were successfully localized by A-ROLL technique and removed surgically. Of all four patients, postoperative histopathologic examination revealed nodal cancer metastases in three patients (75%) and lymphoid hyperplasia in one patient. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A-ROLL technique has proved to be accurate and safe in the identification and excision of clinically occult axillary lymph node recurrence. J. Surg. Oncol.

        <docTitle>A novel tumor suppressor gene RhoBTB2 (DBC2): Frequent loss of expression in sporadic breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>A novel tumor suppressor gene RhoBTB2 (DBC2): Frequent loss of expression in sporadic breast cancer.

RhoBTB2 was isolated recently as a tumor suppressor gene from human chromosome 8p21.3. Although RhoBTB2 was found to be frequently lost in breast cancer lines, expression status of RhoBTB2 in sporadic breast cancer tissues and its clinical and prognostic value, however, remain unclear. Tissue samples from breast cancer patients and normal controls and cell samples from cell lines were collected and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to monitor the presence of RhoBTB2 mRNA. The protein expression of RhoBTB2 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Cumulative survival time was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. We discovered that RhoBTB2 expression was lacking in a breast ductal epithelial carcinoma cell line T-47D but was expressed in other types of tumor cell lines and normal tissues we tested. The results from tissue samples showed that RhoBTB2 was absent in 60% of breast cancers on both the mRNA and protein level. The results from RT-PCR were completely uniform with those from immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that loss of RhoBTB2 more frequently occurred in postmenopausal patients of age &gt;/=50 yr old and in patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. The prognostic value of RhoBTB2 in breast cancers also be assessed by a long-term follow-up investigation and we found that patients with RhoBTB2-negative breast cancer were linked to poor clinical prognosis. Therefore, the loss of RhoBTB2 expression is a common occurrence in breast cancers and it is an important factor in the development and prognosis of sporadic breast cancer.

        <docTitle>Disruption of the blood brain barrier by brain metastases of triple-negative and basal-type breast cancer but not HER2/neu-positive breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Disruption of the blood brain barrier by brain metastases of triple-negative and basal-type breast cancer but not HER2/neu-positive breast cancer.

BACKGROUND:: Generally, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of brain metastasis was thought to be disrupted. METHODS:: We retrospectively performed immunohistochemical staining for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) to evaluate the status of the BBB in resected brain metastases. Associations between expression of GLUT1 and/or BCRP and the immunohistochemical profiles of breast cancers, such as the statuses of hormone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu), and a basal-type marker (cytokeratin 5/6, HER1), were also analyzed. RESULTS:: The study included 29 breast cancer patients with brain metastasis who had undergone brain tumor resections. Among the 29 patients, there was no expression of GLUT1 and BCRP in the intratumor microvessels of 9 (32%) and 11 (38%) patients, respectively. There was no expression of both GLUT1 and BCRP in 8 patients (28%). The expression of GLUT1 was significantly associated with that of BCRP (P &lt; .001). A positive correlation was observed between the expression of GLUT1 and/or BCRP and brain metastases of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer (P = .012), while a negative correlation was observed between the expression of GLUT1 and/or BCRP and brain metastases of triple negative or basal-type breast cancer (P = .014 and P = .003 for triple negative and basal-type, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:: Brain metastases of triple negative or basal-type breast cancers may often disrupt the BBB, whereas brain metastases of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer tend to preserve the BBB.

        <docTitle>CAS proteins in normal and pathological cell growth control.</docTitle>
        <docText>CAS proteins in normal and pathological cell growth control.

Proteins of the CAS (Crk-associated substrate) family (BCAR1/p130Cas, NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L, EFS/SIN and CASS4/HEPL) are integral players in normal and pathological cell biology. CAS proteins act as scaffolds to regulate protein complexes controlling migration and chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell cycle, and differentiation, and have more recently been linked to a role in progenitor cell function. Reflecting these complex functions, over-expression of CAS proteins has now been strongly linked to poor prognosis and increased metastasis in cancer, as well as resistance to first-line chemotherapeutics in multiple tumor types including breast and lung cancers, glioblastoma, and melanoma. Further, CAS proteins have also been linked to additional pathological conditions including inflammatory disorders, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as developmental defects. This review will explore the roles of the CAS proteins in normal and pathological states in the context of the many mechanistic insights into CAS protein function that have emerged in the past decade.</docText>

        <docTitle>Quantitative analysis of urinary phospholipids found in patients with breast cancer by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: II. Negative ion mode analysis of four phospholipid classes.</docTitle>
        <docText>Quantitative analysis of urinary phospholipids found in patients with breast cancer by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: II. Negative ion mode analysis of four phospholipid classes.

Analysis was performed on four different categories of phospholipids (phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidic acid (PA)) from urine in patients with breast cancer. This quantitative analysis was conducted using nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS-MS). This study shows the profiling of the phospholipids (PLs) that can be identified by the negative ion mode of MS. A previous study (Kim et al. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 393:1649, 21) focused on only two PL classes: phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and were identified by positive ion mode. PLs were extracted by lyophilization of 1 mL of urine from both healthy normal females and breast cancer patients before and after surgery. Separation of PLs was performed by nLC followed by structural identification of PLs using data-dependent collision-induced dissociation. A total of 34 urinary PL molecules (12 PSs, 12 PIs, four PGs, and six PAs) were quantitatively examined. Among the four PL categories examined in this study, most PL classes showed an increase in the total amounts in the cancer patients, yet PIs exhibited some decreases. The present study suggests that the lipid composition found in the urine of breast cancer patients can be utilized for the possible development of disease markers, when the analysis is performed with negative ion mode of nLC-ESI-MS-MS.</docText>

        <docTitle>Expression of TGF-beta signaling factors in invasive breast cancers: relationships with age at diagnosis and tumor characteristics.</docTitle>
        <docText>Expression of TGF-beta signaling factors in invasive breast cancers: relationships with age at diagnosis and tumor characteristics.

The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway can play either a tumor-suppressing or a tumor-promoting role in human breast carcinogenesis. In order to determine whether expression of TGF-beta signaling factors varies by age at onset and breast tumor characteristics that have prognostic significance, we undertook a study of 623 women with invasive breast carcinoma enrolled in a population-based case-control study conducted in Poland from 2000 to 2003. TGF-beta signaling factors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue microarrays. We found that most tumors expressed extracellular-TGF-beta1 (78%), TGF-beta2 (91%), TGF-beta3 (93%), TGF-betaR2 (72%), and phospho-SMAD2 (61%), whereas intracellular-TGF-beta1 was expressed in 32% of tumors. Expression of TGF-beta ligands (beta1, beta2, and beta3) was associated with prognostically favorable pathological features including small size, and low grade, and these associations were similar for ER-positive and negative tumors. On the contrary, expression of the receptor TGF-betaR2 was primarily associated with small tumor size among ER-negative tumors, while expression of the transcription factor phospho-SMAD2 was associated with positive nodal status among ER-negative tumors. The greater frequency of expression of phospho-SMAD2 in cancers associated with lymph node metastases is consistent with a pro-progression role for TGF-beta. In addition, expression of extracellular-TGF-beta1 (P = 0.005), TGF-betaR2 (P = 8.2E-11), and phospho-SMAD2 (P = 1.3E-8) was strongly associated with earlier age at onset, independent of ER status. Our data provide evidence that TGF-beta signaling patterns vary by age and pathologic features of prognostic significance including ER expression. These results warrant analysis in studies of clinical outcomes accounting for age, ER status and treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Potential therapeutic strategy for oral squamous cell carcinoma by ErbB3-binding protein 1 gene transfer.

OBJECTIVE: An ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1), was shown to be a potent tumor suppressor in breast and prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that the inhibitory properties of the Ebp1 gene could be beneficial if ectopically expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. METHODS: One OSCC cell line Tca8113 was stably transfected with the complete Ebp1 cDNA or the vector control pcDNA3.1. The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vitro proliferation assay, cell cycle distribution and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as in vivo tumorigenicity. RESULTS: Stable gene transfer was verified by Western Blot analysis and reverse transcription RT-PCR. Following transfection of Ebp1, a significant reduction in cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar were observed. Ectopic expression of Ebp1 led to a change in cell cycle profile and most importantly, a strong decrease in tumorigenicity of human OSCC cell line in a xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic expression of Ebp1 mediates multiple antitumor activities against OSCC, suggesting a potential of Ebp1-based novel therapy for clinical OSCC treatment.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cosmetic Outcome and Percentage of Breast Volume Excision in Oncoplastic Breast Conserving Surgery.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cosmetic Outcome and Percentage of Breast Volume Excision in Oncoplastic Breast Conserving Surgery.

BACKGROUND: Since breast-conserving surgery demonstrated identical long term survival on seven randomized trials, it has become the preferred treatment option over mastectomy. Oncoplastic surgery applying simple reshaping and displacement techniques allows inclusion of patients with large tumors in the group selected for breast-conserving surgery. However, the cosmetic outcome and the degree of patient satisfaction, especially in relation to the original breast volume and the percentage of breast tissue excised is not well documented. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to assess patient satisfaction with cosmetic outcome after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery, and to establish the correlation between patient satisfaction and percentage of breast volume excision (PBVE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 169 Asian patients underwent breast-conserving surgery for primary breast cancer at either United Christian Hospital (UCH) or Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital (HKSH) from Nov 2007 to Jan 2008 by two breast surgeons. Among this group, 162 patients with breast-conserving surgery incorporating oncoplastic techniques were prospectively recruited for study. Tumor characteristics, patient satisfaction, cosmetic outcome and surgeons' score were prospectively documented. Breast volume (BV) calculation was based on preoperative mammography (BV = 1/3pir(1)r(2)h), which was validated by our previous study to correlate strongly with actual BV (r = 0.98). PBVE was calculated by dividing the fresh specimen weight by the calculated BV. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess patient satisfaction and surgeons' score on cosmetic outcome during the first 1-3 postoperative months. The correlation between PBVE and patient satisfaction was studied. RESULTS: The median age of the group of patients studied was 52 years (range: 20-96 years). The median tumor size was 2.5 cm (range: 0.6-5 cm). The median breast volume was 493 cm(3) (range: 210-1,588 cm(3)). The median PBVE was 7.4% (range: 1-42%), and 94% of patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the cosmetic outcome. In addition, 85% of patients felt that the treated breast was nearly identical with or only slightly different from the untreated breast. In scoring breast shape, surgeons indicated that 89% of the treated breasts were identical to or only minimally different from the untreated breast. Patient satisfaction decreased significantly when the PBVE exceeded 20%. Neither tumor location nor distance of the tumor from the nipple had any effect on patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed high patient satisfaction and good cosmetic outcome after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery, even in small breast sized Asian women. The application of oncoplastic technique allows large volume excision, and satisfaction remains high with breast volume excision less than 20% regardless of tumor location or distance of the tumor from the nipple. More complicated oncoplastic techniques, e.g., breast replacement, might be required if breast volume excision exceeds 20%.</docText>

        <docText>Efficacy of oral tegafur-uracil (UFT) as adjuvant therapy as compared with classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in early breast cancer: a pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials (N.SAS-BC 01 trial and CUBC trial).

Two randomized clinical studies comparing the efficacy of oral UFT (2 years) with that of classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) (six courses) have been conducted in patients with resected early breast cancer. We have performed a pooled analysis of these two randomized studies. A pooled analysis was performed using individual patient data from the two trials. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined with a Cox model stratified by study and adjusted for clinical characteristics. We preplanned to verify the following two hypotheses: UFT is non-inferior to CMF in all patients (hypothesis 1) or in ER-positive patients (hypothesis 2) with respect to relapse-free survival (RFS). Non-inferiority of UFT versus CMF was established if the upper limit of the two-sided confidence interval (CI) of the HR for RFS did not exceed 1.30. Hochberg multiplicity adjustment for the significance level was performed. A total of 1,057 patients were analyzed (CMF, n = 528; UFT, n = 529). Median follow-up time was 5.6 years. The HR for RFS was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.78-1.40) in all patients and 0.79 (97.5% CI, 0.49-1.27) in ER-positive patients. UFT was shown to be non-inferior to CMF in ER-positive patients. An exploratory subgroup analysis showed that RFS was better with UFT than with CMF in ER-positive patients who were 50 years or older (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-1.01). UFT is non-inferior to CMF in terms of inhibiting recurrence of ER-positive, early breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Glutathione S-transferase M1 polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis involving 46,281 subjects.

Published data on the association between present/null polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between the GSTM1 present/null polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed for null versus present genotype. A total of 59 studies including 20,993 cases and 25,288 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, significantly elevated breast cancer risk was associated with null genotype when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04-1.16). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found for Caucasians (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00-1.10) and Asians (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.35). When stratified by population-based studies or hospital-based studies, statistically significantly elevated risks were found among population-based studies (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03-1.20). In the subgroup analysis by menopausal status, statistically significantly increased risks were found among postmenopausal women (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.04-1.28). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the GSTM1 null genotype is a low-penetrant risk factor for developing breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>A novel synthetic iminoquinone, BA-TPQ, as an anti-breast cancer agent: in vitro and in vivo activity and mechanisms of action.

Herein, we report our examination of the anti-breast cancer activity of a novel synthetic compound, 7-(benzylamino)-1, 3, 4, 8-tetrahydropyrrolo [4, 3, 2-de]quinolin-8(1H)-one (BA-TPQ). This agent is an analog of a naturally occurring marine compound, and was found to be the most active out of more than 40 related compounds. We investigated the in vitro activity of BA-TPQ on the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of breast cancer cells using the MTT and BrdUrd assays, and Annexin/Annexin-PI staining and flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-cancer effects of BA-TPQ were evaluated in xenograft models of breast cancer. Finally, the mechanisms of action of the compound were also assessed by cDNA microarrays, RT-PCR and Western blotting. In a dose-dependent manner, BA-TPQ inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in vitro, and showed in vivo efficacy in mice bearing MCF-7 or MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors. We demonstrated that BA-TPQ modifies the expression of numerous molecules involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Similar changes in protein expression were observed in vitro and in vivo, as determined by examination of cells and excised xenograft tumors. Our preclinical data indicate that BA-TPQ is a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer that has multiple hormone-, Her2-, and p53-independent mechanisms of action, providing a basis for further development of the compound as a novel anticancer agent.</docText>

        <docTitle>Impact of multiple caregiving roles on elevated depressed mood in early-stage breast cancer patients and same-age controls.</docTitle>
        <docText>Impact of multiple caregiving roles on elevated depressed mood in early-stage breast cancer patients and same-age controls.

The effect of caregiving roles on risk of elevated depressed mood over 12 months was examined in early-stage (0-IIA) breast cancer patients and same-aged women without breast cancer. Women were interviewed 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months following definitive surgical treatment (patients) or routine screening mammogram (controls). The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale was administered at each interview and dichotomized for analysis (&lt;16 [little/no depressed mood] vs. &gt;/=16 [elevated depressed mood]). Participants were categorized as having no caregiving responsibilities, caregiving for children or other persons, or caregiving for both children and others (multiple caregiving roles). Two multivariable marginal logistic regression models with repeated measures were fit (one each for patients and controls) to examine the effect of caregiving roles on elevated depressed mood, using generalized estimating equations to account for intra-individual correlations. Of 1096 participants (mean age 58; 76% white), 1019 with caregiving data were included in the analysis. Compared with baseline, patients with multiple caregiving roles (23/521 patients) were at increased risk of elevated depressed mood at 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-44.46; P = 0.034), and controls with multiple caregiving roles (15/498 controls) were at decreased risk of elevated depressed mood at 12-month follow-up (aOR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.97; P = 0.047). Patients with multiple caregiving roles were more likely while controls were less likely to report elevated depressed mood over time, suggesting a need to identify patients with multiple caregiving roles early during their treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Hormone-Responsive Model of Primary Human Breast Epithelium.

Retention of hormone responsiveness in primary culture models of human breast is essential for studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of action of the ovarian hormones in the human breast. In this chapter we describe the development of a culture model of primary human breast that retains critical features of the tissue in vivo. We find that primary normal human breast tissue in embedded culture recapitulates the morphology, cell lineages, functional gene expression characteristics and estrogen and progesterone receptor responsiveness of the breast in vivo. The ratio of luminal to myoepithelial cells after culture recapitulates that observed in the uncultured tissue, highlighting the fact that progenitor cells capable of giving rise to both epithelial cell lineages are retained in this model system. By contrast, primary cells placed into monolayer culture, even for a single passage, lose bipotent progenitors, and the myoepithelial lineage predominates, demonstrating the rapidity with which phenotypic changes and selection occur in normal breast cells, unless cultured under conditions that prevent this outcome. Primary matrix-embedded culture of normal human breast cells provides researchers with a new opportunity to understand ovarian hormone action in the human breast.</docText>

        <docText>Can Choice of the Sample Population Affect Perceived Performance: Implications for Performance Assessment.

BACKGROUND: There is accelerating interest in measuring and reporting the quality of care delivered by health care providers and organizations, but methods for defining the patient panels for which they are held accountable are not well defined. OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential impact of using alternative algorithms to define accountable patient populations for performance assessment. RESEARCH DESIGN: We used administrative data regarding Community Health Center (CHC) visits in simulations of performance assessment for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen CHC sites in the northeastern US. MEASURES: We used three different algorithms to define patient populations eligible for measurement of cancer screening rates and simulated center-level performance rates based on these alternative population definitions. RESULTS: Focusing on breast cancer screening, the percentage of women aged 51-75 eligible for this measure across CHCs, if using the most stringent algorithm (requiring a visit in the assessment year plus at least one visit in the 2 years prior), ranged from 28% to 60%. Analogous ranges for cervical and colorectal cancer screening were 18-59% and 26-62%, respectively. Simulated performance data from the centers demonstrate that variations in eligible patient populations across health centers could lead to the appearance of large differences in health center performance or differences in expected rankings of CHCs when no such differences exist. For instance, when holding performance among similar populations constant, but varying the proportion of populations seen across different health centers, simulated health center adherence to screening guidelines varied by over 15% even though actual adherence for similar populations did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Quality measurement systems, such as those being used in pay-for-performance and public reporting programs, must consider the definitions used to identify sample populations and how such populations might differ across providers, clinical practice groups, and provider systems.</docText>

        <docText>Fluorescence Imaging and Whole-Body Biodistribution of Near-Infrared-Emitting Quantum Dots after Subcutaneous Injection for Regional Lymph Node Mapping in Mice.

PURPOSE: This study compares fluorescence imaging to mass spectroscopy (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy, ICP-MS) for detection of quantum dots (QDs) in sentinel lymph node (LN) mapping of breast cancer. PROCEDURES: We study the accumulation of near-infrared-emitting QDs into regional LNs and their whole-body biodistribution in mice after subcutaneous injection, using in vivo fluorescence imaging and ex vivo elemental analysis by ICP-MS. RESULTS: We show that the QD accumulation in regional LNs is detectable by fluorescence imaging as early as 5 min post-delivery. Their concentration reaches a maximum at 4 h then decreases over a 10-day observation period. These data are confirmed by ICP-MS. The QD uptake in other organs, assessed by ICP-MS, increases steadily over time; however, its overall level remains rather low. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence imaging can be used as a non-invasive alternative to ICP-MS to follow the QD accumulation kinetics into regional LNs.</docText>

        <docText>Synergistic Effects of Polymorphisms in DNA Repair Genes and Endogenous Estrogen Exposure on Female Breast Cancer Risk.

BACKGROUND: Endogenous estrogen is suggested to initiate cell proliferation and cause oxidative DNA damage during breast tumorigenesis. Cells eliminate DNA damage by means of repair enzymes. Genotypic variants of DNA damage repair genes, participating in base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways, may act as modifiers that affect the association between estrogen exposure and breast cancer. METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study of female breast cancer, DNA samples were obtained from 401 cases and 533 enrolled healthy controls, all of whom were Chinese women in Taiwan. Genotyping of polymorphisms of XRCC1 (Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln), OGG1 (Ser326Cys and Arg229Gln), ERCC2 Lys751Gln, ERCC4 Ser662Pro, and ERCC5 His1104Asp was performed and used to evaluate breast cancer susceptibility. RESULTS: Of the nonsynonymous polymorphisms, the ERCC5 1104Asp variant was significantly associated with breast cancer (odds ratio = 1.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.97), and this association was more pronounced in women with lengthy estrogen exposure. A trend toward an increased risk of developing breast cancer was observed in women who carried greater numbers of combined high-risk genotypes of BER and NER genes (P (trend) = .038). The synergistic effect of multiple genes on the increase of risk was significant in women with a longer period of estrogen exposure (&gt;26 years), greater age at first full-term pregnancy (&gt;26 years), a longer menarche-to-first full-term pregnancy interval (&gt;11 years), and higher body mass index (&gt;22) (all P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that genotype polymorphisms related to DNA damage repair confer greater susceptibility to endogenous estrogen in the development of breast cancer in women.</docText>

        <docText>Development and characterization of a novel method for the analysis of gene expression patterns in lymphatic endothelial cells derived from primary breast tissues.

The combined application of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and gene expression microarray analysis has rarely been used to study lymphangiogenesis because of technical obstacles. In this study, a novel method using this combined approach was developed to analyze the gene expression patterns in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). First, LECs were identified in frozen sections using rapid immunostaining and isolated using LCM, and then intact RNA from the LECS was purified and amplified. The expression profile was analyzed using microarray analysis, and the expression of selected genes (Sema4C and C4orf7) was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assays. These results indicate that the combination of RIHC-LCM, two-round linear amplification of the small sample RNA and genome-wide microarray analysis allows gene expression profiling of tumor LECs, which provides a powerful tool for the study of molecular details in human lymphangiogenesis-related diseases, such as lymphatic metastasis of human breast cancers. These findings also suggest that the LEC-specific genes Sema4C and C4orf7 may play an important role in the oncogenesis of human breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Neonatal cytomegalovirus infection: Diagnostic modalities available for early disease detection.

CMV is a ubiquitous virus. In India, there is high seroendemicity with almost 99% adults showing IgG antibodies. Infection or re-activation becomes important in immunocompromised host (Transplant recipients, Cancer therapy patients and patients with HIV/AIDS). Neonates form a distinctive high risk population for congenital CMV infection and suffer disastrous sequlae of the same. Neonatal infections may be congenital in nature or may be acquired after birth during first month of life via infected breast milk or due to exposure to high risk blood products. The risk for transmission of the virus to the fetus is higher in primary infected mothers than in mothers with reactivated disease. Primary CMV infections are reported in 1-4% of seronegative women during pregnancy and the risk for viral transmission to fetus is 30-40%. Reactivation of a CMV infection during pregnancy is reported in 10-30% of seropositive women and the risk of transmitting the virus is about 1-3%. The adverse outcome of congenital neonatal CMV infection includes-microcephaly (70%), intellectual impairment (60%), sensineural hearing loss (35%), choriorenitis (22%), hepatosplenomegaly (70%), jaundice (68%), thrombocytopenia (65%), low birth weight (65%), pneumonitis (2-5%) and congenital heart disease (&lt;5%). About 5-10% of congenitally infected asymptomatic infants will have neurological problems later in life the most common of which is unilateral or bilateral sensory neural hearing loss.All immunocompromised hosts, including pre-term neonates, mount weak antibody responses (IgM), making serological detection of CMV infection in them, fallacious. Thus, it is imperative to use antigen detection methods such as quantitative PCR or PP65 Antigenaemia assays to detect CMV infection in immunocompromised host. Sakhuja et al and Minz et al have demonstrated that PP65 Antigenaemia assay is very good for diagnosing CMV disease in renal transplant recipients. The present review tends to highlight the role of newer diagnostic modalities in early CMV infection detection in neonatal population.</docText>

        <docText>Inhibitory effects of tea polyphenols by targeting cyclooxygenase-2 through regulation of nuclear factor kappa B, Akt and p53 in rat mammary tumors.

Breast cancer has become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The control of this disease can be achieved through chemoprevention, which refers to the consumption of synthetic or naturally occurring agents to block, reverse, or delay the process of tumor development. Tea (Camellia sinensis), the most widely consumed beverage, has shown promises in the field of cancer chemoprevention. Inhibition of tumorigenesis by green or black tea polyphenols has been demonstrated in various in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we examined the inhibitory effect of green tea polyphenol (GTP) and black tea polyphenol (BTP) on the development of mammary tumors- induced by 7, 12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) in female, Wistar rats. 13% and 33% of animals developed tumors in GTP and BTP supplemented groups, respectively. Both GTP and BTP are effective in significantly inhibiting the cumulative number of mammary tumors (by ~92% and 77%, respectively) and in reducing their growth. Mechanistically, we investigated the effects of GTP and BTP on the components of cell signaling pathways, connecting biomolecules involved in cancer development. GTP and BTP supplementation as a sole source of drinking solution leads to scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (by ~72% and 69%, respectively) by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and inactivation of phosphorylated forms of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and Akt. Altogether, the study suggests that both cultivars of tea, i.e. green and black, have anti-tumorigenic potential against DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis in Wistar rats. Further studies such as large and long term cohort studies and clinical trials are warranted.</docText>

        <docText>Patient delay among Colombian women with breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Characterize diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in Bogota, Colombia and examine the extent and determinants of patient delay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a census approach we identified 1 106 women with breast cancer. Information was gathered through personal interviews and the review of medical records. Patient delay was defined as the time elapsed from first symptoms to initial consultation. RESULTS: More than 80% of the women (902) consulted due to symptoms; the majority had advanced-stage disease. Patient delay was established in 20.3% and the main related factors were older age, lack of social security and advanced clinical stage. Higher education in patients was associated with reduced delays. DISCUSSION: Women do not recognize breast cancer symptoms. Patient delay and related factors are similar to those found in other studies. There is an urgent need to develop communication and education strategies regarding breast cancer symptoms and early detection.</docText>

        <docText>Five-year survival and prognostic factors in a cohort of breast cancer patients treated in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.

The purpose of this study was to analyze five-year survival and the main prognostic factors among women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1998 to 2000 that had undergone surgical treatment in the city of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Study variables were: age, skin color, place of residence, tumor-related variables, and treatment-related variables. Survival functions were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Disease-specific survival was 81.8%. Tumor size and lymph node involvement were the main independent prognostic factors in the study population, with increased risk of death for women with tumor size greater than 2.0cm (HR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.26-3.07) and positive axillary lymph nodes (HR = 4.04; 95%CI: 2.55-6.39). The results emphasize the need for earlier diagnosis and treatment. Access to screening at different levels of care, mainly for women at high risk, should be a key priority for the Unified National Health System in Brazil.</docText>

        <docText>Cellular senescence induced by aberrant MAD2 levels impacts on paclitaxel responsiveness in vitro.

Background:The mitotic arrest deficiency protein 2 (MAD2) is a key component of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, monitoring accurate chromosomal alignment at the metaphase plate before mitosis. MAD2 also has a function in cellular senescence and in a cell's response to microtubule inhibitory (MI) chemotherapy exemplified by paclitaxel.Methods:Using an siRNA approach, the impact of MAD2 down-regulation on cellular senescence and paclitaxel responsiveness was investigated. The endpoints of senescence, cell viability, migration, cytokine expression, cell cycle analysis and anaphase bridge scoring were carried out using standard approaches.Results:We show that MAD2 down-regulation induces premature senescence in the MCF7 breast epithelial cancer cell line. These MAD2-depleted (MAD2 downward arrow) cells are also significantly replicative incompetent but retain viability. Moreover, they show significantly higher levels of anaphase bridges and polyploidy compared to controls. In addition, these cells secrete higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 representing key components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) with the ability to impact on neighbouring cells. In support of this, MAD2 downward arrow cells show enhanced migratory ability. At 72 h after paclitaxel, MAD2 downward arrow cells show a significant further induction of senescence compared with paclitaxel naive controls. In addition, there are significantly more viable cells in the MAD2 downward arrow MCF7 cell line after paclitaxel reflecting the observed increase in senescence.Conclusion:Considering that paclitaxel targets actively dividing cells, these senescent cells will evade cytotoxic kill. In conclusion, compromised MAD2 levels induce a population of senescent cells resistant to paclitaxel.</docText>

        <docText>CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms in relation to tumour characteristics and early breast cancer related events among 652 breast cancer patients.

Background:CYP2C8/9 polymorphisms may influence breast cancer-free survival after diagnosis due to their role in the metabolism of tamoxifen, paclitaxel, and other chemotherapy. cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C8/9 metabolise arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which enhance migration and invasion in vitro and promote angiogenesis in vivo. We aimed to investigate the frequency of CYP2C8/9 polymorphisms in relation to breast tumour characteristics and disease-free survival.Methods:A prospective series of 652 breast cancer patients from southern Sweden was genotyped for CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3. Blood samples and questionnaires were obtained pre- and postoperatively. Clinical information and tumour characteristics were obtained from patients' charts and pathology reports.Results:Frequencies of CYP2C8/9 polymorphisms were similar to healthy European populations. Significantly less node involvement (P=0.002) and fewer PR+ tumours (P=0.012) were associated with CYP2C8*4. Median follow-up was 25 months and 52 breast cancer-related events were reported. In a multivariate model, CYP2C8/9*3/*1*/*2/*1 was the only factor associated with increased risk for early events in 297 tamoxifen-treated, ER-positive patients, adjusted HR 2.54 (95%CI 1.11-5.79). The effect appeared to be driven by CYP2C8*3, adjusted HR 8.56 (95%CI 1.53-51.1).Conclusion:Polymorphic variants of CYP2C8/9 may influence breast tumour characteristics and disease-free survival in tamoxifen-treated patients.</docText>

        <docTitle>Absence of truncating BRIP1 mutations in chromosome 17q-linked hereditary prostate cancer families.</docTitle>
        <docText>Absence of truncating BRIP1 mutations in chromosome 17q-linked hereditary prostate cancer families.

Background:In a genome-wide scan (GWS) of 175 multiplex prostate cancer (PCa) families from the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Genetics Project (PCGP), linkage was observed to markers on chromosome 17q21-24, a region that includes two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRIP1. BRIP1 is a Fanconi anaemia gene (FANCJ) that interacts with the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and has a role in DNA damage repair. Protein truncating mutations in BRIP1 have been identified in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families, and a recent report suggested that a recurrent truncating mutation (R798X) may have a role in PCa susceptibility.Methods:We examined the role of BRIP1 mutations in hereditary PCa through sequence analysis of 94 individuals from PCGP families showing linkage to 17q.Results:A total of 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including 7 missense variants but no protein truncating mutations, were observed.Conclusion:The data presented here suggest that BRIP1 truncating mutations are uncommon in PCa cases and do not account for the linkage to chromosome 17q observed in our GWS. Additional investigation is needed to determine the significance, if any, of the observed BRIP1 missense variants in hereditary PCa.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 24 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605433 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>Second solid cancers after radiotherapy for breast cancer in SEER cancer registries.

Background:Radiotherapy for breast cancer reduces disease recurrence and breast cancer mortality. However, it has also been associated with increased second cancer risks in exposed sites.Methods:We evaluated long-term second cancer risks among 182 057 5-year survivors of locoregional invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1973 and 2000 and reported to US NCI-SEER Program cancer registries. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) and excess cases of second cancer in women who had surgery and radiotherapy, compared with those who had surgery alone. Second cancer sites were grouped according to doses received from typical tangential breast fields.Results:By the end of 2005 (median follow-up=13.0 years), 15 498 second solid cancers had occurred, including 6491 contralateral breast cancers. The RRs for radiotherapy were 1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.33-1.58) for high-dose second cancer sites (1+ Gy: lung, oesophagus, pleura, bone and soft tissue) and 1.09 (1.04-1.15) for contralateral breast cancer ( approximately 1 Gy). These risks decreased with increasing age and year of treatment. There was no evidence of elevated risks for sites receiving medium (0.5-0.99 Gy, RR=0.89 (0.74-1.06)) or low doses (&lt;0.5 Gy, RR=1.01 (0.95-1.07)). The estimated excess cases of cancer in women treated with radiotherapy were as follows: 176 (95% CI=69-284) contralateral breast cancers or 5% (2-8%) of the total in all 1+year survivors, and 292 (222-362) other solid cancers or 6% (4-7%) of the total.Conclusions:Most second solid cancers in breast cancer survivors are not related to radiotherapy.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 24 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605435 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>Collagen and calcium-binding EGF domains 1 is frequently inactivated in ovarian cancer by aberrant promoter hypermethylation and modulates cell migration and survival.

Background:Collagen and calcium-binding EGF domains 1 (CCBE1) is an uncharacterised gene that has down-regulated expression in breast cancer. As CCBE1 maps to 18q21.32, a region frequently exhibiting loss of heterozygosity in ovarian cancer, the aim of this study was to determine the expression and function of CCBE1 in ovarian cancer.Methods:Expression and methylation patterns of CCBE1 were determined in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumours. CCBE1 contains collagen repeats and an aspartic acid/asparagine hydroxylation/EGF-like domain, suggesting a function in extracellular matrix remodelling and migration, which was determined using small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown and over-expression of CCBE1 in cell lines.Results:CCBE1 is expressed in normal ovary, but is reduced in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary carcinomas. Pharmacological demethylation/deacetylation in ovarian cancer cell lines re-induced CCBE1 expression, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to its silencing in cancer. CCBE1 promoter hypermethylation was detected in 6/11 (55%) ovarian cancer cell lines and 38/81 (41%) ovarian carcinomas. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCBE1 in ovarian cancer cell lines enhanced their migration; conversely, re-expression of CCBE1 reduced migration and survival. Hence, loss of CCBE1 expression may promote ovarian carcinogenesis by enhancing migration and cell survival.Conclusions:These data suggest that CCBE1 is a new candidate tumour suppressor in ovarian cancer.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 24 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605429 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>Oncogenic and cell survival properties of the retinoic acid metabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1.

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is associated with increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis in animal models and elevated risk for a number of human cancers. Here, we found that CYP26A1, the gene encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme specifically involved in metabolic inactivation of retinoic acid (RA), the most active vitamin A derivative, is highly expressed in 42% (27/65) of primary breast cancers. We also showed that enhanced expression of CYP26A1 suppresses cellular responses to anoikis and consequently promotes anchorage-independent growth. This transformed phenotype was sufficient to markedly increase tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Suppression of CYP26A1 significantly reversed the CYP26A1-mediated oncogenic characteristics, suggesting a direct link between intracellular RA status and tumorigenicity. Our observations provide strong evidence for oncogenic and cell survival properties of CYP26A1 in carcinogenesis, and suggest mechanisms whereby VAD might promote cancer development.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.414.</docText>

        <docText>Adenosine A1 receptor, a target and regulator of estrogen receptoralpha action, mediates the proliferative effects of estradiol in breast cancer.

Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and its ligand estradiol (E2) has critical roles in breast cancer growth and are key therapeutic targets. In this study, we report a novel dual role of the adenosine A1 receptor (Adora1) as an E2/ERalpha target and a regulator of ERalpha transcriptional activity. In ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells, E2 upregulated Adora1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, an effect that was reversed by the E2 antagonist ICI 182 780. Small interference RNA ablation of Adora1 in ERalpha-positive cells reduced basal and E2-dependent proliferation, whereas Adora1 over-expression in an ERalpha-negative cell line induced proliferation. The selective Adora1 antagonist, DPCPX, reduced proliferation, establishing Adora1 as a mediator of E2/ERalpha-dependent breast cancer growth. Intriguingly, Adora1 ablation decreased both mRNA and protein levels of ERalpha and, consequently, estrogen-responsive element-dependent ERalpha transcriptional activity. Moreover, Adora1 ablation decreased binding activity of ERalpha to the promoter of its target gene TFF1 and led to reduced TFF1 promoter activity and mRNA levels, suggesting that Adora1 is required for full transcriptional activity of ERalpha on E2 stimulation. Taken together, we showed a short feed-forward loop involving E2, ERalpha and Adora1 that favors breast cancer growth. These data suggest that Adora1 may represent an important target for therapeutic intervention in hormone-dependent breast cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.409.</docText>

        <docText>c-Jun activation is required for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced cell death in breast cancer cells.

The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown to mediate tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. However, the downstream mediators of the JNK pathway linking tamoxifen to effectors of apoptosis have yet to be identified. In this study, we analysed whether c-Jun, the major nuclear target of JNK, has a role in tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of SkBr3 breast cancer cells. We show that before DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activation, cytotoxic concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) induced JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun at JNK sites earlier shown to regulate c-Jun-mediated apoptosis. In addition, OHT induced ERK-dependent expression of c-Fos and transactivation of an AP-1-responsive promoter. In particular, the ectopic expression of dominant-negative constructs blocking either AP-1 activity or c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation prevented DNA fragmentation after OHT treatment. Furthermore, both c-Fos expression and c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation preceded OHT-dependent activation of caspase 3-7 in different types of tamoxifen-sensitive cancer cells, but not in OHT-resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the c-Jun/c-Fos AP-1 complex has a pro-apoptotic role in OHT-treated cancer cells and suggest that pharmacological boosts of c-Jun activation may be useful in a combination therapy setting to sensitize cancer cells to tamoxifen-mediated cell death.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.400.</docText>

        <docTitle>Activation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway in human cancer and the clinical implications.</docTitle>
        <docText>Activation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway in human cancer and the clinical implications.

The hedgehog pathway, initially discovered by two Nobel laureates Drs E Wieschaus and C Nusslein-Volhard in Drosophila, is a major regulator for cell differentiation, tissue polarity and cell proliferation. Studies from many laboratories reveal activation of this pathway in a variety of human cancer, including basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), medulloblastomas, leukemia, gastrointestinal, lung, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. It is thus believed that targeted inhibition of hedgehog signaling may be effective in treatment and prevention of human cancer. Even more exciting is the discovery and synthesis of specific signaling antagonists for the hedgehog pathway, which have significant clinical implications in novel cancer therapeutics. In this review, we will summarize major advances in the last 2 years in our understanding of hedgehog signaling activation in human cancer, interactions between hedgehog signaling and other pathways in carcinogenesis, potential antagonists for hedgehog signaling inhibition and their clinical implications for human cancer treatment.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.392.</docText>

        <docText>Transcriptome profiling of a TGF-beta-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition reveals extracellular clusterin as a target for therapeutic antibodies.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plays a dual role in tumorigenesis, switching from acting as a growth inhibitory tumor suppressor early in the process, to a tumor promoter in late-stage disease. Since TGF-beta's prometastatic role may be linked to its ability to induce tumor cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we explored TGF-beta's EMT-promoting pathways by analysing the transcriptome changes occurring in BRI-JM01 mammary tumor epithelial cells undergoing a TGF-beta-induced EMT. We found the clusterin gene to be the most highly upregulated throughout most of the TGF-beta time course, and showed that this results in an increase of the secreted form of clusterin. By monitoring several hallmark features of EMT, we demonstrated that antibodies targeting secreted clusterin inhibit the TGF-beta-induced EMT of BRI-JM01 cells, as well as the invasive phenotype of several other breast and prostate tumor cell lines (4T1, NMuMG, MDA-MB231LM2 and PC3), without affecting the proliferation of these cells. These results indicate that secreted clusterin is a functionally important EMT mediator that lies downstream within TGF-beta's EMT-promoting transcriptional cascade, but not within its growth-inhibitory pathways. To further investigate the role played by secreted clusterin in tumor metastasis, we assessed the effect of several anti-clusterin monoclonal antibodies in vivo using a 4T1 syngeneic mouse breast cancer model and found that these antibodies significantly reduce lung metastasis. Taken together, our results reveal a role for secreted clusterin as an important extracellular promoter of EMT, and suggest that antibodies targeting clusterin may inhibit tumor metastasis without reducing the beneficial growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.399.</docText>

        <docText>YAP-dependent induction of amphiregulin identifies a non-cell-autonomous component of the Hippo pathway.

The Hippo signalling pathway regulates cellular proliferation and survival, thus has profound effects on normal cell fate and tumorigenesis. The pivotal effector of this pathway is YAP (yes-associated protein), a transcriptional co-activator amplified in mouse and human cancers, where it promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant transformation. So far, studies of YAP target genes have focused on cell-autonomous mediators; here we show that YAP-expressing MCF10A breast epithelial cells enhance the proliferation of neighbouring untransfected cells, implicating a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We identify the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin (AREG) as a transcriptional target of YAP, whose induction contributes to YAP-mediated cell proliferation and migration, but not EMT. Knockdown of AREG or addition of an EGFR kinase inhibitor abrogates the proliferative effects of YAP expression. Suppression of the negative YAP regulators LATS1 and 2 (large tumour suppressor 1 and 2) is sufficient to induce AREG expression, consistent with physiological regulation of AREG by the Hippo pathway. Genetic interaction between the Drosophila YAP orthologue Yorkie and Egfr signalling components supports the link between these two highly conserved signalling pathways. Thus, YAP-dependent secretion of AREG indicates that activation of EGFR signalling is an important non-cell-autonomous effector of the Hippo pathway, which has implications for the regulation of both physiological and malignant cell proliferation.</docText>

        <docText>The prognostic value of Ki67 is dependent on estrogen receptor status and histological grade in premenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of Ki67 in relation to established prognostic factors in lymph node-negative breast cancer, and furthermore, whether the prognostic impact was dependent on estrogen receptor (ER) status and histological grade. In 200 premenopausal patients, with 5 years of follow-up, Ki67 was determined on tissue microarrays. In univariate analysis, Ki67 (&lt;/=20 vs &gt;20%) was a prognostic factor for distant disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.4, P=0.005) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 4.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.7-14, P=0.003). When stratifying for ER status and histological grade, Ki67 was a significant prognostic factor for distant disease-free survival and overall survival only in the ER-positive group, and only in patients with histological grade 2, respectively. In multivariate analysis, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and age were independent prognostic factors for distant disease-free survival, whereas Ki67, histological grade, and tumor size were not. Ki67 was, however, an independent prognostic factor in the 87% of the patients who had not received adjuvant medical treatment. Agreement between the three readers was very good (kappa-values: 0.83-0.88). Furthermore, Ki67 was a significant prognostic factor for all three investigators (hazard ratio: 2.7-3.2). This study shows that Ki67 is a prognostic factor in node-negative breast cancer. It is noteworthy that the prognostic information of Ki67 is restricted to ER-positive patients, and to patients with histological grade 2. Taken together, Ki67, as an easily assessed and reproducible proliferation factor, may be an alternative or complement to histological grade as a prognostic tool and for selection of adjuvant treatment.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 20 November 2009; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2009.167.</docText>

        <docTitle>Multicenter Evaluation of a Novel Nanoparticle Immunoassay for 5-Fluorouracil on the Olympus AU400 Analyzer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Multicenter Evaluation of a Novel Nanoparticle Immunoassay for 5-Fluorouracil on the Olympus AU400 Analyzer.

BACKGROUND:: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most widely used chemotherapy drug, primarily against gastrointestinal, head and neck, and breast cancers. 5-FU has large pharmacokinetic variability resulting in unexpected toxicity or ineffective treatment. Therapeutic drug management of 5-FU minimizes toxicity and improves outcome. A nanoparticle-based immunoassay was developed to provide oncologists with a rapid, cost-effective tool for determining 5-FU plasma concentrations. METHODS:: Monoclonal antibodies, bound to nanoparticles, were used to develop an immunoassay for the Olympus AU400. Assay precision, linearity, calibration stability, and limit of detection were run at multiple centers; interference, cross-reactivity, lower limit of quantitation and recovery at 1 center. Clinical samples collected from 4 cancer centers were analyzed for 5-FU concentrations by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and compared with the immunoassay results. RESULTS:: With calibrators from 0 to 1800 ng/mL 5-FU and autodilution, concentrations up to 9000 ng/mL could be determined. Time to first result was 10 minutes, and 400 samples per hour could be quantitated from a standard curve stored for &gt;30 days. Imprecision across all laboratories was &lt;5%, and the assay was linear upon dilution over the entire range. Cross-reactivities for dihydro-5-FU, uracil, capecitabine, and tegafur were &lt;1%, 9.9%, 0.05%, and 0.23%, respectively. The limit of detection was 52 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantitation of 86 ng/mL. Assay results of clinical samples (93-1774 ng/mL) correlated with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry results: (R = 0.9860, slope 1.035, intercept 10.87 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS:: This novel immunoassay is suitable for quantitating 5-FU plasma concentrations with advantages of speed, small sample size, minimal sample pretreatment, and application on automated instrumentation. These advantages enable efficient therapeutic drug management of 5-FU in clinical practice.</docText>

        <docTitle>Is Radiation Therapy for Keloids Acceptable? The Risk of Radiation-Induced Carcinogenesis.</docTitle>
        <docText>Is Radiation Therapy for Keloids Acceptable? The Risk of Radiation-Induced Carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND:: Keloids have been treated by using radiation for over a century, and it is currently suggested that keloids are best treated by a combination of surgery and postoperative radiation therapy, although randomized controlled trials testing this are still lacking. However, plastic surgeons tend to avoid radiation therapy for keloids for fear of inducing malignant tumors. Thus, the authors searched for previous reports of associations between carcinogenesis and keloid radiation therapy, and examined the evidence-based opinions of radiation oncologists regarding the acceptability of using radiation to treat keloids. METHODS:: A computerized literature search was carried out using PubMed that included citations from MEDLINE and PubMed Central between 1901 and March of 2009. The following search terms were used: "keloid(s)," "hypertrophic scar(s)," "radiation," "radiation therapy," "radiotherapy," "carcinogenesis," "carcinoma," "cancer," "complications," and "side effects." Moreover, the references for each report were also retrieved. RESULTS:: The authors located five cases of carcinogenesis (i.e., fibrosarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and breast carcinoma) that were associated with radiation therapy for keloids. However, it was unclear whether an appropriate dose of radiation was used and whether sufficient protection of surrounding tissues was provided. Moreover, a questionnaire study of radiation oncologists around the world revealed that approximately 80 percent considered radiation to be acceptable for treating keloids. CONCLUSIONS:: The authors conclude that the risk of carcinogenesis attributable to keloid radiation therapy is very low when surrounding tissues, including the thyroid and mammary glands, especially in children and infants, are adequately protected, and that radiation therapy is acceptable as a keloid treatment modality.</docText>

        <docText>Incidence of Precancerous Lesions in Breast Reduction Tissue: A Pathologic Review of 562 Consecutive Patients.

BACKGROUND:: Reduction mammaplasty is the fifth most common reconstructive surgical procedure in the United States. The incidence of invasive breast cancer in breast reduction specimens is between 0.06 and 0.4 percent. However, the incidence of atypical hyperplasia and other precancerous lesions is not well described. METHODS:: The authors conducted a single-center retrospective chart review examining the incidence of benign and precancerous lesions in breast reduction specimens over a 5-year period. RESULTS:: Of the 562 patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty, 52.7 percent had nonproliferative or proliferative breast lesions. Twenty-five patients (4.4 percent) had a specimen containing atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia. Six patients (1.1 percent) had ductal carcinoma in situ and four patients (0.7 percent) had lobular carcinoma in situ. No occult invasive breast cancer was identified in the breast reduction specimens, but one patient with ductal carcinoma in situ was found to have invasive breast cancer on completion mastectomy (0.2 percent). CONCLUSION:: This study demonstrates the importance of systematic analysis of breast reduction specimens to help identify and guide the management of patients with increased risk of breast cancer following reduction mammaplasty.</docText>

        <docTitle>Breast Cancer and Bariatric Surgery: Temporal Relationships of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Reconstruction.</docTitle>
        <docText>Breast Cancer and Bariatric Surgery: Temporal Relationships of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Reconstruction.

BACKGROUND:: Given the increased prevalence of bariatric surgery, a certain number of women will develop breast cancer before or after bariatric intervention. Whether bariatric surgery reduces the risk of breast cancer remains uncertain. Similarly, reconstructive options for these patients and timing of reconstruction relative to their weight loss have not been established. METHODS:: Patients who underwent bariatric procedures from 1992 to 2007 and were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1988 to 2007 were assessed. Outcome measures included age, body mass indices, timing of cancer diagnosis, type of bariatric procedure, treatment and reconstructive modalities, postoperative complications, and comorbidities. RESULTS:: A total of 2878 women underwent bariatric procedures and 112,085 women had breast cancer diagnoses. Thirty-six women had breast cancer diagnosed before (group I) and 13 after bariatric surgery (group II) (p &lt; 0.001). Group I had a mean age of 49.4 years and mean body mass index of 56.3. One woman underwent unilateral autologous/implant reconstruction followed by bariatric surgery and subsequently required revision. Three women in group II (mean age at diagnosis, 48.3 years; mean pre-weight loss body mass index, 53.5; mean body mass index at diagnosis, 32.9; mean time from bariatric surgery, 33 months; mean follow-up from reconstruction, 18 months) underwent autologous free tissue reconstruction; one required two revisions because of further weight loss. CONCLUSIONS:: Complication profiles related to reconstruction may be compounded by timing of bariatric surgery and subsequent weight loss. Further multicenter prospective analysis should aid in assessing cancer risk after weight loss along with timing of reconstruction to optimize outcomes in this population.</docText>

        <docText>BILATERAL INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY ANEURYSM SIMULATING PITUITARY APOPLEXY: CASE REPORT.

OBJECTIVE: Intracavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms can extend into the sella and simulate pituitary adenomas. However, they are rarely associated with pituitary apoplexy. We present a rare case of bilateral intracavernous ICA aneurysms simulating a sellar mass with the clinical picture of a pituitary apoplexy. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 82-year-old woman presented with a classic case of pituitary apoplexy with a history of headache, nausea, vomiting, and diplopia. She was found to have an intrasellar mass simulating a large and invasive pituitary adenoma. The patient had a medical history positive for breast cancer. INTERVENTION: Because of the presentation with apoplexy and the possibility of metastatic breast cancer or pituitary adenoma, the patient was explored transsphenoidally to obtain pathological verification and possibly resect the tumor. Unusual intraoperative findings led to a microDoppler evaluation, suggesting a vascular lesion. Intraoperatively, an angiogram confirmed the presence of bilateral ICA giant aneurysms involving the ICA intracavernous component extending into the sella turcica. The patient refused further treatment. CONCLUSION: The present case indicates that an intrasellar ICA aneurysm can be misdiagnosed as a macroadenoma and even present through pituitary apoplexy. When treating intrasellar masses with the slightest suspicion of a nonpituitary origin, further workup should be considered. The possibility of a vascular lesion simulating a pituitary adenoma should always be considered by neurosurgeons and ear, nose, and throat surgeons operating in the sellar region.</docText>

        <docText>Is the phenotype mixed or mistaken? Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and hyperplastic polyposis syndrome.

PURPOSE:: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is a hereditary syndrome defined by personal and family history of colorectal and other cancers. Some patients with this condition have multiple serrated polyps, which are the hallmark of hyperplastic polyposis syndrome, a rare colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by multiple hyperplastic/serrated polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that this may represent a unique group of patients, and this study investigates a possible association between the two syndromes. METHODS:: A hereditary colorectal cancer registry was reviewed for patients who fit hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial colorectal cancer and hyperplastic polyposis syndrome criteria. RESULTS:: Twelve patients from seven families were identified. Four families had more than one person meeting the criteria. All patients were white, and four were women. Ten of 12 patients fit Amsterdam criteria, and two were designated with familial colorectal cancer. The median cumulative number of hyperplastic polyps resected per patient was 6, half of which were located in the right colon. Seven of the 12 patients developed colorectal cancer. Ten patients had personal or family history of other cancers: prostate, breast, testicular, salivary gland, lung, and Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS:: Patients meeting criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer may also carry a diagnosis of hyperplastic polyposis syndrome. Possible explanations include: 1) two hereditary syndromes are present in the same patient, 2) serrated polyps are part of the phenotype of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or 3) hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is potentially misdiagnosed in some families who do, in fact, have hyperplastic polyposis.</docText>

        <docText>Bisphosphonates: ready for use as adjuvant therapy of breast cancer?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe recent data on the effects of bisphosphonates on bone health for patients with primary breast cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Data are accumulating regarding the salutary effect of bisphosphonates on bone health. Preservation of bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk, has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials of bisphosphonates. These trials have included premenopausal and postmenopausal women and endocrine and chemotherapy adjuvant breast cancer treatments. In these trials there has been a focus on gonadal dysfunction, use of aromatase inhibitors and the risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Data with bisphosphonates in this clinical setting have not confirmed clinical benefit for fracture risk.Adjuvant studies to assess the prevention of bone metastases have appropriate scientific rationale, including the potential antitumor effects of bisphosphonates, but large randomized controlled trials are incomplete. SUMMARY: The use of a bisphosphonate is warranted for preservation of bone mineral density in women with primary breast cancer and gonadal dysfunction or drug-induced hypoestrogenism. The potential additional benefit of delay or prevention of bone metastasis awaits confirmation from randomized controlled trials.Expert consensus panels have suggested guidelines for use of bisphosphonates for prevention of cancer treatment induced bone loss.</docText>

        <docText>The emerging potential of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) represents an important novel target in cancer therapy. It is essential for the repair of single-strand DNA breaks via the base excision repair pathway. Inhibitors of PARP-1 were first developed as chemosensitizers. However, preclinical data suggest that PARP inhibitors can act as single agents to selectively kill cancers with BRCA (breast cancer associated) 1 or 2 mutations and cancers harbouring defects in other DNA repair proteins. Why PARP inhibitors are synthetically lethal to certain tumours and the specific role this class of drugs may play in the treatment of breast cancer is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Phase I clinical trial results confirm that PARP inhibitors have single agent activity in cancers with BRCA 1/2 mutations. Phase II data also suggest a benefit in combination with chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancers without an increase in normal tissue toxicity. SUMMARY: There are currently eight PARP inhibitors in clinical trial development worldwide. Data from early clinical trials suggest a role in the treatment of BRCA-related and triple-negative breast cancer. A wider role for this class of drug in breast cancer is proposed; however, as little is known about the long-term effects of these drugs, we should proceed with caution and await results of the ongoing clinical trials.</docText>

        <docText>A Proposed Unified Mechanism for the Reduction of Human Breast Cancer Risk by the Hormones of Pregnancy.

Parity in women is associated with reduced lifetime risk of breast cancer, and hormones of pregnancy (estrogen E, progesterone P, human chorionic gonadotropin; hCG) are implicated. Parity also reduces mammary cancer risk in carcinogen-exposed rats, and administering pregnancy hormones to these animals is similarly effective. Because pregnancy hormones are also able to stimulate cancer growth, we proposed to resolve this dichotomy by determining whether administered pregnancy hormones elicit the cancer-inhibiting agent alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) from the liver, which would implicate AFP as a proximal effector of hormonal anticancer activity. Accordingly, we treated groups of nitrosomethylurea-exposed rats with saline, E(3), E(2) + P, E(3) + P, hCG, or allowed them to experience pregnancy, then monitored mammary cancer incidence and serum levels of AFP over time. Each hormone treatment reduced mammary cancer incidence and elevated serum AFP levels. To challenge human tissues, human HepG2 liver cells in culture were treated with the same hormonal agents. Each hormone regimen increased the levels of AFP in the culture medium. Medium containing AFP elicited by hCG inhibited the E(2)-stimulated proliferation of cultured human MCF7 breast cancer cells, whereas hCG alone did not inhibit their growth. Furthermore, antibodies to AFP neutralized the growth-inhibiting effect of AFP-containing HepG2 medium. We conclude that in the treatment of carcinogen-exposed rats with the hormones of pregnancy, and by inference in women who have experienced pregnancy, that AFP is a proximal agent that inhibits mammary gland cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Strongly Enhanced Antitumor Activity of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab Combination Treatment on HER2-Positive Human Xenograft Tumor Models.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family plays an important role in cell survival and proliferation, and is implicated in oncogenesis. Overexpression of HER2 is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 and has proven survival benefit for women with HER2-positive early and metastatic breast cancer. Pertuzumab, another monoclonal antibody, is a HER2 dimerization inhibitor that binds to a different epitope on HER2 than trastuzumab and inhibits HER2 dimer formation with other HER family members such as HER3 and HER1. We investigated the antitumor activity of these agents alone and in combination in HER2-positive breast and non-small cell lung cancer xenografts. Our data show that the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has a strongly enhanced antitumor effect and induces tumor regression in both xenograft models, something that cannot be achieved by either monotherapy. The enhanced efficacy of the combination was also observed after tumor progression during trastuzumab monotherapy. Near-IR fluorescence imaging experiments confirm that pertuzumab binding to tumors is not impaired by trastuzumab pretreatment. Furthermore, we show by in vitro assay that both trastuzumab and pertuzumab potently activate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, our data suggest that the strongly enhanced antitumor activity is mainly due to the differing but complementary mechanisms of action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, namely inhibition of HER2 dimerization and prevention of p95HER2 formation.

        <docText>Confounding Effects in "A Six-Gene Signature Predicting Breast Cancer Lung Metastasis": Reply.

Molecular signatures have begun to elucidate the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic diversity of breast tumors. Breast tumors are characterized by five different molecular subtypes that are associated with distinct clinical outcomes in terms of prognosis, treatment response, and site of relapse. In particular, the basal-like and luminal B subtypes of tumors are more aggressive and have a higher tendency to metastasize to the lung than do the other subtypes. Given this difference in metastatic profiles of breast tumors, the six-gene signature (6GS) that we showed to be predictive of lung relapse was reexamined in the context of the tumor subtypes. This first analysis suggested that the 6GS is a surrogate for molecular subtype, discriminating basal-like tumors rather than tumors that metastasize to the lung. Here, we show that the 6GS discriminates the two overlapping features, the basal-like subtype and the tendency to metastasize to the lung. Nevertheless, the 6GS predicts lung metastases of breast tumors independent of the molecular subtypes. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):OF1-5].</docText>

        <docText>Invasion of Human Breast Cancer Cells In vivo Requires Both Paracrine and Autocrine Loops Involving the Colony-Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor.

Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and its receptor (CSF-1R) have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of various types of cancer, including breast cancer. This is based on high levels of circulating CSF-1 in patient sera with aggressive disease and increased CSF-1R staining in the tumor tissues. However, there have been no direct in vivo studies to determine whether a CSF-1 autocrine signaling loop functions in human breast cancer cells in vivo and whether it contributes to invasion. Recently, in mouse and rat models, it has been shown that invasion and metastasis are driven by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)/CSF-1 paracrine loop between tumor cells and host macrophages. In this macrophage-dependent invasion, tumor cells secrete CSF-1 and sense EGF, whereas the macrophages secrete EGF and sense CSF-1. Here, we test the hypothesis that in human breast tumors, the expression of both the CSF-1 ligand and its receptor in tumor cells leads to a CSF-1/CSF-1R autocrine loop which contributes to the aggressive phenotype of human breast tumors. Using MDA-MB-231 cell-derived mammary tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency mice, we show here for the first time in vivo that invasion in a human mammary tumor model is dependent on both paracrine signaling with host macrophages as well as autocrine signaling involving the tumor cells themselves. In particular, we show that the autocrine contribution to invasion is specifically amplified in vivo through a tumor microenvironment-induced upregulation of CSF-1R expression via the transforming growth factor-beta1.

        <docText>Prevention of Mammary Carcinogenesis in MMTV-neu Mice by Cruciferous Vegetable Constituent Benzyl Isothiocyanate.

Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a constituent of edible cruciferous vegetables, inhibits growth of human breast cancer cells in culture. The present study provides in vivo evidence for efficacy of BITC for prevention of mammary cancer in MMTV-neu mice. Administration of BITC at 1 and 3 mmol/kg diet for 25 weeks markedly suppressed the incidence and/or burden of mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma in female MMTV-neu mice without causing weight loss or affecting neu protein level. For example, cumulative incidence of hyperplasia/carcinoma was significantly lower in mice fed BITC-supplemented diets compared with control mice (P = 0.01 by Fisher's test). The BITC-mediated prevention of mammary carcinogenesis correlated with suppression of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The average number of Ki-67-positive cells in the carcinoma lesions of 3 mmol BITC group was lower by approximately 21% (P &lt; 0.05) compared with tumors from control mice. Apoptotic bodies in the mammary tumor were higher by about 2- to 2.5-fold in the 1 and 3 mmol BITC treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05) compared with control group. The BITC administration also resulted in overexpression of E-cadherin and infiltration of CD3(+) T-cells in the tumor. Although BITC treatment increased cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro, dietary feeding of BITC failed to augment NK cell lytic activity in an ex vivo assay. The present study demonstrating efficacy of BITC against mammary cancer in an animal model provides impetus to determine its activity in a clinical setting. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):OF1-8].</docText>

        <docText>Circulating Carotenoids, Mammographic Density, and Subsequent Risk of Breast Cancer.

Mammographic density is one of the strongest predictors of breast cancer risk. Recently, it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species may influence breast cancer risk through its influence on mammographic density. In the current study, we addressed this hypothesis and also assessed if the association between carotenoids and breast cancer risk varies by mammographic density. We conducted a nested case-control study consisting of 604 breast cancer cases and 626 controls with prospectively measured circulating carotenoid levels and mammographic density in the Nurses' Health Study. Circulating levels of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were measured. We used a computer-assisted thresholding method to measure percent mammographic density. We found no evidence that circulating carotenoids are inversely associated with mammographic density. However, mammographic density significantly modified the association between total circulating carotenoids and breast cancer (P heterogeneity = 0.008). Overall, circulating total carotenoids were inversely associated with breast cancer risk (P trend = 0.01). Among women in the highest tertile of mammographic density, total carotenoids were associated with a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8). In contrast, there was no inverse association between carotenoids and breast cancer risk among women with low mammographic density. Similarly, among women in the highest tertile of mammographic density, high levels of circulating alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were associated with a significant 40% to 50% reduction in breast cancer risk (P trend &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that plasma levels of carotenoids may play a role in reducing breast cancer risk, particularly among women with high mammographic density.

        <docText>Activating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor {gamma} Mutant Promotes Tumor Growth In vivo by Enhancing Angiogenesis.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is expressed in a variety of cancer cells. The addition of ligand activates the receptor by inducing a conformational change in the receptor, which can be recapitulated by mutation. To investigate the role of activated PPARgamma signaling in breast cancer, we compared the function of a constitutively active PPARgamma (PgammaCA) mutant with the wild-type PPARgamma in ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. Tumor cells transduced with either PPARgamma or PgammaCA were implanted into immunocompetent FVB mice. Enhanced tumor growth was observed in PgammaCA-transduced cells, which was associated with increased angiogenesis and endothelial stem cells as evidenced by increased number of cells stained with von Willebrand factor, c-Kit, CD133, and CD31. Genome-wide expression profiling identified a group of genes within the angiogenesis pathway, including Angptl4, as targets of activated PPARgamma; PgammaCA also induced Angptl4 protein secretion in ErbB2-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Angptl4 promoted vascular endothelial cell migration; conversely, immunodepletion of Angptl4 reduced PgammaCA-mediated cellular migration. Collectively, these studies suggest that activated PPARgamma induces Angptl4 to promote tumor growth through enhanced angiogenesis in vivo. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):OF1-9].</docText>

        <docTitle>EZH2 Is Essential for Glioblastoma Cancer Stem Cell Maintenance.</docTitle>
        <docText>EZH2 Is Essential for Glioblastoma Cancer Stem Cell Maintenance.

Overexpression of the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) occurs in diverse malignancies, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Based on its ability to modulate transcription of key genes implicated in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and cell differentiation, EZH2 is believed to play a crucial role in tissue-specific stem cell maintenance and tumor development. Here, we show that targeted pharmacologic disruption of EZH2 by the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), or its specific downregulation by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), strongly impairs GBM cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal in vitro and tumor-initiating capacity in vivo. Using genome-wide expression analysis of DZNep-treated GBM CSCs, we found the expression of c-myc, recently reported to be essential for GBM CSCs, to be strongly repressed upon EZH2 depletion. Specific shRNA-mediated downregulation of EZH2 in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that c-myc is a direct target of EZH2 in GBM CSCs. Taken together, our observations provide evidence that direct transcriptional regulation of c-myc by EZH2 may constitute a novel mechanism underlying GBM CSC maintenance and suggest that EZH2 may be a valuable new therapeutic target for GBM management.

        <docText>MBP-1 Inhibits Breast Cancer Growth and Metastasis in Immunocompetent Mice.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women. We have shown previously an antiproliferative effect of MBP-1 on several human cancer cells. In this study, we have examined the potential of MBP-1 as a gene therapeutic candidate in regression of breast cancer growth and metastasis in an immunocompetent mouse model. For this, we have used a mouse breast cancer cell line (EO771) and syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. EO771 cells were implanted into the mammary fat pad of C57BL/6 mice. Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing MBP-1 was administered intratumorally to determine gene therapeutic potential. The results showed a significant regression of primary and distant (lung) tumor growth. Animals exhibited prolonged survival on treatment with MBP-1 compared with the control group (dl312). Subsequent studies suggested that MBP-1 inhibits matrix metalloproteinase expression in human breast cancer cells. Cells transduced with MBP-1 displayed inhibition of migration in a wound-healing assay. The conditioned medium from MBP-1-transduced cells blocked in vitro tube formation assay and inhibited expression of several angiogenic molecules. Taken together, our study shows that MBP-1 acts as a double-edged sword by inhibiting primary and metastatic tumor growth and modulating matrix metalloproteinase expression with a therapeutic potential against breast cancer progression.

        <docText>Inhibition of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Is Required for Optimal Antitumor Effect of HER2 Inhibitors against HER2-Overexpressing Cancer Cells.

PURPOSE: A significant fraction of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers exhibit resistance to the HER2 antibody trastuzumab. Hyperactivity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway confers trastuzumab resistance, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major downstream effector of PI3K/AKT. Therefore, we examined whether mTOR inhibitors synergize with trastuzumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunocompetent mice bearing HER2(+) mammary tumors were treated with trastuzumab, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the combination. Mice were imaged for tumor cell death using an optical Annexin-V probe and with [(18)F]FDG positron emission tomography. The signaling and growth effects of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 on HER2(+) cells treated with trastuzumab or lapatinib were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment of mice with trastuzumab plus rapamycin was more effective than single-agent treatments, inducing complete regression of 26 of 26 tumors. The combination induced tumor cell death (Annexin-V binding) and inhibited FDG uptake. Rapamycin inhibited mTOR and tumor cell proliferation as determined by phosphorylated S6 and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, respectively. In culture, the combination of RAD001 plus trastuzumab inhibited cell growth more effectively than either drug alone. Trastuzumab partially decreased PI3K but not mTOR activity. Knockdown of TSC2 resulted in HER2-independent activation of mTOR and dampened the response to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Treatment with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib decreased phosphorylated S6 and growth in TSC2-expressing cells but not in TSC2-knockdown cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of PI3K and mTOR are required for the growth-inhibitory effect of HER2 antagonists. These findings collectively support the combined use of trastuzumab and mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of HER2(+) breast cancer. (Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(23):7266-76).</docText>

        <docText>ABT-888 Confers Broad In vivo Activity in Combination with Temozolomide in Diverse Tumors.

PURPOSE: ABT-888, currently in phase 2 trials, is a potent oral poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that enhances the activity of multiple DNA-damaging agents, including temozolomide (TMZ). We investigated ABT-888+TMZ combination therapy in multiple xenograft models representing various human tumors having different responses to TMZ. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ABT-888+TMZ efficacy in xenograft tumors implanted in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and metastatic sites was assessed by tumor burden, expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymer, and O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT). RESULTS: Varying levels of ABT-888+TMZ sensitivity were evident across a broad histologic spectrum of models (55-100% tumor growth inhibition) in B-cell lymphoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic, ovarian, breast, and prostate xenografts, including numerous regressions. Combination efficacy in otherwise TMZ nonresponsive tumors suggests that TMZ resistance may be overcome by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition. Profound ABT-888+TMZ efficacy was seen in experimental metastases models that acquired resistance to TMZ. Moreover, TMZ resistance was overcome in crossover treatments, indicating that combination therapy may overcome acquired TMZ resistance. Neither tumor MGMT, mismatch repair, nor poly(ADP-ribose) polymer correlated with the degree of sensitivity to ABT-888+TMZ. CONCLUSIONS: Robust ABT-888+TMZ efficacy is observed across a spectrum of tumor types, including orthotopic and metastatic implantation. As many TMZ nonresponsive tumors proved sensitive to ABT-888+TMZ, this novel combination may broaden the clinical use of TMZ beyond melanoma and glioma. Although TMZ resistance may be influenced by MGMT, neither MGMT nor other mechanisms of TMZ resistance (mismatch repair) precluded sensitivity to ABT-888+TMZ. Underlying mechanisms of TMZ resistance in these models are not completely understood but likely involve mechanisms independent of MGMT.(Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(23):7277-90).</docText>

        <docText>Interactions of the Hdm2/p53 and Proteasome Pathways May Enhance the Antitumor Activity of Bortezomib.

PURPOSE: p53 is inactivated in many human malignancies through missense mutations or overexpression of the human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation. The cis-imidazoline nutlin-3 can disrupt the p53-Hdm2 interaction and activate p53, inducing apoptosis in vitro in many malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We hypothesized that suppression of Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination may augment sequelae of p53 accumulation caused by proteasomal inhibition. We compared the response of MM cells versus several epithelial cancer models to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with nutlin-3. RESULTS: The combination of sublethal concentrations of bortezomib plus nutlin-3 induced additive cytotoxicity against bortezomib-sensitive MM cell lines. Importantly, however, in breast, prostate, colon, and thyroid (papillary, follicular, anaplastic, and medullary) carcinoma cell lines, this combination triggered synergistic cytotoxicity, and increased expression of p53, p21, Hdm2, Bax, Noxa, PUMA, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase. Coculture with bone marrow stromal cells attenuated MM cell sensitivity to nutlin-3 monotherapy and was associated with evidence of suppression of p53 activity in MM cells, whereas combined bortezomib-nutlin-3 treatment maintained cytotoxicity even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. CONCLUSIONS: This differential response of MM versus epithelial carcinomas to combination of nutlin-3 with bortezomib sheds new light on the role of p53 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Concurrent Hdm2 inhibition with bortezomib may extend the spectrum of bortezomib applications to malignancies with currently limited sensitivity to single-agent bortezomib or, in the future, to MM patients with decreased clinical responsiveness to bortezomib-based therapy.

        <docText>Antiangiogenic Tetrathiomolybdate Protects against Her2/neu-Induced Breast Carcinoma by Hypoplastic Remodeling of the Mammary Gland.

PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to delineate the efficacy of tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a novel antiangiogenic anticancer agent, as a chemopreventative agent. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Nulliparous Her2/neu transgenic mice were treated with water or TM for 180 days and observed for tumor development during treatment and for 180 days after treatment. Mammary gland composition and architecture were also observed following TM treatment of Her2/neu transgenic and normal FVB mice. RESULTS: At the 1-year follow-up, 86.7% of control and 40% of TM-treated Her2/neu mice had palpable mammary tumors with a median time to tumor development of 234 days (95% confidence interval, 202-279 days) for control and &gt;460 days for TM-treated mice (P &lt; 0.0005, n = 15). The mammary glands from TM-treated Her2/neu and FVB mice showed a blunted epithelial ductal branching system due to a significant decrease in the number of secondary branches and total number of differentiated mammary epithelial cells. Microvessel density in Her2/neu and FVB mammary glands was lowered by 65.6 +/- 6.2% and 50.9 +/- 4.5% (P &lt; 0.005), respectively, following TM therapy, consistent with the antiangiogenic effect of TM. Lastly, TM treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in the absolute number of aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive mammary stem cells in Her2/neu and FVB mammary glands. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results strongly support that TM is a potent chemopreventative agent as a consequence of hypoplastic remodeling of the mammary gland through modulation of the mammary stem cell compartment.

        <docText>Combinatorial pharmacologic approaches target EZH2-mediated gene repression in breast cancer cells.

Polycomb protein EZH2-mediated gene silencing is implicated in breast tumorigenesis through methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 27 (H3K27). We have previously shown that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A can modulate histone methylation and disrupt EZH2 complex. Here, we used 3-deazaneplanocin A, together with other chromatin remodeling agents, as well as RNA interference-mediated EZH2 depletion, to probe the role of EZH2 in coordination with other epigenetic components in gene regulation in breast cancer cells. Through genome-wide gene expression analysis, coupled with extensive chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of histone modifications, we have identified a variety of gene sets that are regulated either by EZH2 alone or through the coordinated action of EZH2 with HDAC and/or DNA methylation. We further found that tumor antigen GAGEs were regulated by distinct epigenetic mechanisms in a cell context-dependent manner, possibly reflecting mechanistic heterogeneity in breast cancer. Intriguingly, we found that EZH2 regulates a remarkable cohort of genes whose functions are highly enriched in immunoresponse and autocrine inflammation network, and that their transcriptional activation upon EZH2 perturbation is cancer specific, revealing a potential novel role of EZH2 in regulating cancer immunity. These findings show the complexity and diversity of epigenetic regulation in human cancer and underscore the importance for developing combinatorial pharmacologic approaches for effective epigenetic gene reactivation.

        <docText>Bim-targeted cancer therapy: A link between drug action and underlying molecular changes.

In the past few years, the pro-apoptotic molecule Bim has attracted increasing attention as a plausible target for tumor therapy. A variety of normal and pathological systems regulated by Bim, dependent on cell type, apoptotic stimulation, and chemotherapeutic agents, have been documented. Bim promotes anoikis of many tumor cells, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and melanoma. Various chemotherapeutic agents use Bim as a mediating executioner of cell death. Hence, Bim suppression supports metastasis and chemoresistance. Imatinib, gefitinib, bortezomib, and Bim protein itself are spotlighted as current and future Bim-targeting therapeutic agents. The potential benefits of Bim-targeted therapies are selectivity of treatment for tumor cells and reduction in tumor-associated phenomena such as chemoresistance and metastasis. Thus, Bim-targeting therapies may provide more effective and unique tumor management modalities in future. This review article discusses all these issues.

        <docText>Prognosis of Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer by HER2 Status and Trastuzumab Treatment: An Institutional-Based Review.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether trastuzumab improves prognosis of women with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu -positive breast cancer beyond that of women with HER2/neu-negative disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two thousand ninety-one women with metastatic breast cancer diagnosed from 1991 to 2007, with known HER2/neu status and who had not received trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting, were identified. Disease was classified into the following three groups: HER2/neu negative, HER2/neu positive without first-line trastuzumab treatment, and HER2/neu positive with first-line trastuzumab treatment. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and compared between groups with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between OS and HER2/neu status after controlling for patient characteristics. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients (5.6%) had HER2/neu-positive disease without trastuzumab treatment, 191 (9.1%) had HER2/neu-positive disease and received trastuzumab treatment, and 1,782 (85.3%) had HER2/neu-negative disease. Median-follow-up was 16.9 months. One-year survival rates among patients with HER2/neu-negative disease, HER2/neu-positive disease and trastuzumab treatment, and HER2/neu-positive disease and no trastuzumab treatment were 75.1% (95% CI, 72.9% to 77.2%), 86.6% (95% CI, 80.8% to 90.8%), and 70.2% (95% CI, 60.3% to 78.1%), respectively. In a multivariable model, women with HER2/neu-positive disease who received trastuzumab had a 44% reduction in the risk of death compared with women with HER2/neu-negative disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.69; P &lt; .0001). This HR varied with time and was significant for the first 24 months and not significant after 24 months. CONCLUSION: Our results show that women with HER2/neu-positive disease who received trastuzumab had improved prognosis compared with women with HER2/neu-negative disease.</docText>

        <docText>Prevalence, Demographics, and Psychological Associations of Sleep Disruption in Patients With Cancer: University of Rochester Cancer Center-Community Clinical Oncology Program.

PURPOSE: Sleep disruption is prevalent in patients with cancer and survivors, but the prevalence of insomnia, a distressing sleep disorder, in these populations has yet to be determined in large-scale studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 823 patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 58 years; 597 female patients) reported on sleep difficulties in a prospective study. RESULTS: During day 7 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy, 36.6% (n = 301) of the patients with cancer reported insomnia symptoms, and 43% (n = 362) met the diagnostic criteria for insomnia syndrome. Patients with cancer younger than 58 years were significantly more likely to experience either symptoms of insomnia or insomnia syndrome (chi(2) = 13.6; P = .0002). Patients with breast cancer had the highest number of overall insomnia complaints. A significant positive association was found between symptoms of insomnia during cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy (phi = .62, P &lt; .0001), showing persistence of insomnia during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. Sixty percent of the patient sample reported that their insomnia symptoms remained unchanged from cycle 1 to cycle 2. Those with insomnia complaints had significantly more depression and fatigue than good sleepers (all P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSION: The proportions of patients with cancer in this sample reporting symptoms of insomnia and meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia syndrome during chemotherapy are approximately three times higher than the proportions reported in the general population. Insomnia complaints persist throughout the second chemotherapy cycle for the majority of patients with cancer in this study. Insomnia is prevalent, underrecognized, undermanaged, and understudied among patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.</docText>

        <docText>Human Activated T Lymphocytes Modulate IDO Expression in Tumors through Th1/Th2 Balance.

Previous cancer vaccination approaches have shown some efficiency in generating measurable immune responses, but they have rarely led to tumor regression. It is therefore possible that tumors emerge with the capacity to down-regulate immune counterparts, through the local production of immunosuppressive molecules, such as IDO. Although it is known that IDO exerts suppressive effects on T cell functions, the mechanisms of IDO regulation in tumor cells remain to be characterized. Here, we demonstrate that activated T cells can induce functional IDO expression in breast and kidney tumor cell lines, and that this is partly attributable to IFN-gamma. Moreover, we found that IL-13, a Th2 cytokine, has a negative modulatory effect on IDO expression. Furthermore, we report IDO expression in the majority of breast and kidney carcinoma samples, with infiltration of activated Th1-polarized T cells in human tumors. These findings demonstrate complex control of immune activity within tumors. Future immune therapeutic interventions should thus include strategies to counteract these negative mechanisms.</docText>

        <docText>Akt2 inhibition enables the Forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a to a repressive role for ER{alpha} transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells.

Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) pathways are engaged in a functional cross-talk in breast cancer, promoting tumor progression and increased resistance to anticancer treatments and radiotherapy. Here we introduce new mechanisms through which proteins of the IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling pathway may regulate ER function in the absence of ligand. Our results indicate that in ER-positive breast cancer cells, Akt2 modulates ER transcriptional activity at multiple levels, including 1) the regulation of ER expression and its nuclear retention and 2) the activation of one of its downstream targets, the forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a. FoxO3a co-localizes and co-precipitates with ER in the nucleus, where it binds to forkhead responsive sequences on ER target pS2/TFF-1 promoter; in addition, FoxO3a silencing leads to an increase of ER transcriptional activity, suggesting a repressive role of the forkhead transcription factor on ER function. Moreover, 17beta-estradiol up-regulates FoxO3a levels, which could represent the basis for an ER mediated homeostatic mechanism. These findings provide further evidence of the importance of proteins of the growth factors signaling in ER regulation, introducing Akt2/FoxO3a axis as a pursuable target in ER-positive breast cancer therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Preoperative Sonographic classification of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer: node-to-node correlation with surgical histology and sentinel node biopsy results.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the role of axillary lymph node classification by sonography in breast cancer patients by node-to-node correlation with surgical histology and sentinel node biopsy results. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between June 2006 and December 2006, preoperative axillary sonography was performed in 191 consecutive breast cancer patients (median age, 46 years; age range, 24-79 years) who had been scheduled to undergo breast cancer surgery with sentinel node biopsy. The axillary lymph node that had the thickest cortex or that was closest to the primary tumor was prospectively classified and then removed through sonographically guided needle localization. Correspondence about and histologic results for the needle-localized nodes and the radioactive sentinel nodes were analyzed. The rate of malignancy, according to the sonographic classification, and the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 191 needle-localized nodes, 41 (21%) had metastases and 150 (79%) did not have metastases. When a cutoff point of a cortical thickness of 2.5 mm was used, sonographic classification showed 85% (35/41) sensitivity, 78% (117/150) specificity, and an area under the curve of 0.861 (95% CI, 0.796-0.926). Of the 54 patients with metastases at sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection, 13 (24%) had false-negative results of sonographically guided needle localization. Unsuccessful lymphatic mapping because of absent radiotracer uptake during sentinel node biopsy was found in 4% (7/191), whereas all needle-localized nodes with a cortical thickness of more than 2.5 mm were confirmed as metastases. CONCLUSION: Sonographic classification of axillary lymph nodes is effective for predicting the presence of metastases to avoid sentinel node biopsy or to reduce unsuccessful lymphatic mapping during sentinel node biopsy.</docText>

        <docText>Short-term follow-up of palpable breast lesions with benign imaging features: evaluation of 375 lesions in 320 women.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of short-term follow-up of palpable masses that have benign imaging features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases of all women with round, oval, or lobular palpable masses with circumscribed margins and homogeneous ultrasound echotexture for which short-term follow-up was recommended from July 1997 through December 2003 were retrospectively identified. Evaluation was by ultrasound and/or mammography and focused clinical examination. Outcome was assessed with imaging or clinical follow-up lasting at least 12 months. The cancer incidence for palpable lesions was compared with that for nonpalpable lesions recommended for short-term follow-up. RESULTS: In 379 women, 443 palpable masses with benign features for which short-term follow-up was recommended were identified. Outcome data were available on 375 masses in 320 women. Lesions were evaluated with mammography and ultrasound (n = 186) or ultrasound alone (n = 189). Masses were typically identified only with ultrasound (n = 258, 68.8%); were oval (n = 275, 73.3%), of equal density to normal breast tissue on mammograms (n = 95 on 117 mammograms, 81.2%), and hypoechoic (n = 336 in 372 ultrasound examinations, 90.3%); and were prospectively believed to be fibroadenoma (n = 304, 81.1%). Eighty-five lesions (22.7%) were biopsied soon after evaluation, and one 1.5-mm ductal carcinoma in situ was diagnosed. At follow-up (mean, 2.7 years), 26 lesions (6.9%) had grown. Twenty-four of the 26 lesions were biopsied, and no cancer was diagnosed. The overall cancer prevalence was similar for palpable (0.3%) and nonpalpable (1.6%) masses. The cost of short-term follow-up was less than that of biopsy. CONCLUSION: Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy of palpable breast lesions with benign imaging features, particularly for young women with probable fibroadenoma.</docText>

        <docText>Quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging as an adjunct to conventional breast MRI for improved positive predictive value.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate whether adding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could improve the positive predictive value (PPV) of breast MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study included 70 women with 83 suspicious breast lesions on DCE-MRI (BI-RADS 4 or 5) who underwent subsequent biopsy. DWI was acquired during clinical breast MRI using b = 0 and 600 s/mm(2). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared for benign and malignant lesions. PPV was calculated for DCE-MRI alone (based on biopsy recommendations) and DCE-MRI plus DWI (adding an ADC threshold) for the same set of lesions. Results were further compared by lesion type (mass, nonmasslike enhancement) and size. RESULTS: Of the 83 suspicious lesions, 52 were benign and 31 were malignant (11 ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], 20 invasive carcinoma). Both DCIS (mean ADC, 1.31 +/- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and invasive carcinoma (mean ADC, 1.29 +/- 0.29 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) exhibited lower mean ADC than benign lesions (1.70 +/- 0.44 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p &lt; 0.001). Applying an ADC threshold of 1.81 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for 100% sensitivity produced a PPV of 47% versus 37% for DCE-MRI alone, which would have avoided biopsy for 33% (17/52) of benign lesions without missing any cancers. DWI increased PPV similarly for masses and nonmasslike enhancement and preferentially improved PPV for smaller (&lt; or = 1 cm) versus larger lesions. CONCLUSION: DWI shows potential for improving the PPV of breast MRI for lesions of varied types and sizes. However, considerable overlap in ADC of benign and malignant lesions necessitates validation of these findings in larger studies.</docText>

        <docText>Estrogen and Xenoestrogens in Breast Cancer.

There is growing concern that estrogenic environmental compounds that act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals might potentially have adverse effects on hormone-sensitive organs such as the breast. This concern is further fueled by evidence indicating that natural estrogens, specifically 17beta-estradiol, are important factors in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. We have developed an in vitro-in vivo model in which we have demonstrated the carcinogenicity of E2 in human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F. Hypermethylation of NRG1, STXBP6, BMP6, CSS3, SPRY1, and SNIP were found at different progression stages in this model. The use of this powerful and unique model has provided a tool for exploring whether bisphenol A and butyl benzyl phthalate have relevance in the initiation of breast cancer. These studies provide firsthand evidence that the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol and xenoestrogenic substances like bisphenol A are able to induce neoplastic transformation in human breast epithelial cells.</docText>

        <docText>Thoracic Paravertebral Block Using Real-Time Ultrasound Guidance.

Background: We developed a technique for ultrasound-guided paravertebral block, which was subsequently applied in the clinical setting. Methods: An initial cadaver study was used to develop a technique that was used in the clinical setting on patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Results: Paravertebral catheters were correctly placed in the cadaveric trial in 8 of 10 attempts. In the clinical study, all blocked patients (n = 9) had evidence of thoracic wall sensory block and analgesia postoperatively. Conclusions: Determined by anatomical dissection, we have described the ultrasound features of the thoracic paravertebral space and performed clinically successful ultrasound-guided paravertebral block.</docText>

        <docText>Keeping abreast of the mammary epithelial hierarchy and breast tumorigenesis.

The epithelium of the mammary gland exists in a highly dynamic state, undergoing dramatic morphogenetic changes during puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and regression. The recent identification of stem and progenitor populations in mouse and human mammary tissue has provided evidence that the mammary epithelium is organized in a hierarchical manner. Characterization of these normal epithelial subtypes is an important step toward understanding which cells are predisposed to oncogenesis. This review summarizes progress in the field toward defining constituent cells and key molecular regulators of the mammary epithelial hierarchy. Potential relationships between normal epithelial populations and breast tumor subtypes are discussed, with implications for understanding the cellular etiology underpinning breast tumor heterogeneity.</docText>

        <docText>The roles of miR-17-92 cluster in mammal development and tumorigenesis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The base pairing interactions between miRNAs and their target mRNAs, often within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of target genes, result in the degradation of target mRNAs or repression of their translation. MiRNAs regulate a diverse range of physiological processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, mammalian development and human disease. Many studies have shown that miR-17-92 cluster, which encodes miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1, and miR-92-1, is expressed in many mammalian tissues. This cluster contributes to the development of heart, lung, blood vessel, and immune system. In addition, it can induce tumorigenesis, such as lymphoma and vascularized tumor as an oncogene. However, miR-17-92 cluster proved to suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor colony formation as a tumor suppressor. This paper reviews the roles of miR-17-92 cluster in mammal development and the relationship between miR-17-92 cluster and tumorigenesis.</docText>

        <docText>Local Recurrence of Invasive Micropapillary Breast Cancer After MammoSite Brachytherapy: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Controversy exists over the optimal patient selection criteria for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI), which has been introduced as an alternative to whole-breast irradiation. The goal is to select patients with the lowest risk for tumor spread outside of the original lumpectomy bed targeted by the local internal radiation dose. Therefore, patients with more aggressive types of breast cancer might not be ideal candidates for partial breast irradiation. We discuss the case of a 67-year-old woman who presented with local recurrence of invasive micropapillary breast cancer, a rare aggressive tumor type, 5 years after MammoSite brachytherapy. The patient's primary tumor possessed all favorable indicators except for the histology of invasive micropapillary carcinoma. This is the first report of invasive micropapillary carcinoma recurring after APBI. Although this is a single case, it supports the hypothesis that more aggressive types of breast cancer have a higher risk of local recurrence after APBI. We propose that invasive micropapillary carcinoma be considered a potential exclusion criterion until it can be validated in prospective clinical trials. More aggressive treatment approaches including whole-breast irradiation and/or chemotherapy might be needed to reduce the risk of local recurrence for invasive micropapillary breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>A Phase II Randomized Crossover Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin Versus Weekly Docetaxel in the First-line Treatment of Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>A Phase II Randomized Crossover Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin Versus Weekly Docetaxel in the First-line Treatment of Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

Purpose: We aim to compare the efficacy and toxicity of liposomal doxorubicin and weekly docetaxel as first-line treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients and Methods: Patients who had received no previous chemotherapy for MBC were eligible. Previous hormonal therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy were allowed. Patients were randomized to receive liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 intravenously [I.V.] every 28 days or weekly docetaxel 36 mg/m2 I.V. days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 28 days. Patients with objective response or stable disease after 2 cycles continued treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. At progression, patients were allowed to cross over to the other regimen. The trial was designed to detect a true difference of 10% in response rate with an 80% power. Results: Between March 2001 and July 2007, 102 patients were randomized. The 2 groups had similar demographics; 68% of patients had received previous adjuvant chemotherapy. Liposomal doxorubicin and weekly docetaxel produced similar objective response rates (28% vs. 31%), disease control rates (48% vs. 44%), and progression-free survival (6.5 months vs. 5.5 months). Both agents were well tolerated. Both agents produced crossover responses as second-line treatment (liposomal doxorubicin, 35%; weekly docetaxel, 14%). Conclusion: Liposomal doxorubicin is well tolerated and has activity similar to weekly docetaxel in the first-line treatment of patients with MBC.</docText>

        <docText>Use of multiple drains after mastectomy is associated with more patient discomfort and longer postoperative stay.

Background: Seromas constitute a common complication following surgery for breast cancer, and closed drainage is used routinely to reduce its incidence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of number of drains on patient discomfort, seroma formation, and hospital stay during the immediate postoperative period after mastectomy for breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Based on a retrospective review of our clinical database, 110 consecutive patients from January 2004 through January 2006 who had undergone a mastectomy and axillary clearance for breast cancer were sent a simple postal questionnaire for collection of data. Results: A total of 70 patients responded (all women; mean age, 69.4 +/- 11.4 years). Twenty-seven patients (38.57%) had 3 drains implanted unilaterally, 24 (34.28%) had 2, and 19 (27.14%) had 1 drain. They were divided into 2 groups: the first group with 1 drain (19 patients) and the other with 2 or 3 drains (51 patients). Median postoperative hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-8 days); patients with 1 drain had a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay (median, 2 days [range, 1-4 days] vs. 2 days [range, 1-8 days]; Mann-Whitney U test, P = .02). A total of 15 patients (21.43%) complained of a seroma. There was no difference in seroma rates between groups. Patients who had a single drain implanted had a significantly lower rate of discomfort (median, 2 [range, 1-5] vs. 3 [range, 1-7]; Mann-Whitney U test; P = .04). Conclusion: The number of drains used after a mastectomy for breast cancer did not significantly affect the rate or amount of seromas in this study, but the use of a single drain after mastectomy was significantly associated with less discomfort and shorter postoperative hospital stay.</docText>

        <docTitle>Phase II Trial of Docetaxal Plus Imatinib Mesylate in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Phase II Trial of Docetaxal Plus Imatinib Mesylate in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

Background: Inhibition of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) might improve the efficacy of chemotherapy by lowering interstitial tumor pressure and allowing increased tumor penetration by cytotoxic agents. In this phase II trial, we added imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor, to docetaxel in the first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients and Methods: Women with MBC who had received a maximum of 1 previous chemotherapy regimen were eligible for this trial. Initially, patients received oral imatinib 600 mg daily and docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The imatinib dose was lowered from 600 mg to 400 mg daily because of toxicity (primarily gastrointestinal) observed in the first 15 patients. Patients were evaluated for response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) after 8 weeks of therapy; treatment continued in responding/stable patients until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate. Results: Thirty-seven patients entered this trial between May 2005 and March 2008. This regimen was relatively poorly tolerated, even after reduction of the imatinib dose, primarily because of gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). Eight patients (22%) stopped therapy because of toxicity before the 8-week initial evaluation. Six of 37 enrolled patients (16%; 95% CI, 4.3%-28.1%) had partial responses; an additional 4 patients had stable disease for &gt; 6 months. The median progression-free and overall survivals were 9.3 months and 15.4 months, respectively. Conclusion: When compared with previous results with single-agent docetaxel, the combination of weekly docetaxel plus imatinib was tolerated relatively poorly and produced a low objective response rate. The efficacy of weekly docetaxel is not improved by concurrent administration of imatinib as a PDGFR inhibitor.</docText>

        <docText>Outcome differences between patients with node-negative breast cancer classified according to the st. Gallen risk categories.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the 2007 St. Gallen risk categories with the outcomes of patients with node-negative breast cancer (NNBC). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1500 women with pathologically T1-T3 NNBC treated at the Clinic Hospital, Valencia University (Spain) from 1982 to 2000. Systemic adjuvant treatment was administered to 89.9% of the patients in the whole sample (37% received only hormonal therapy and 52.9% chemotherapy). The 2007 St. Gallen criteria were used to divide the whole sample into 1201 patients with intermediate risk (with &gt;/= 1 of the following: pathologic tumor size &gt; 2 cm, grade 2-3, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor absent, HER2/neu gene overexpressed or amplified, or age &lt; 35 years) and 299 patients with low risk. Of the 1201 patients with intermediate risk, 56% received adjuvant chemotherapy. The intermediate- and low-risk groups were compared for relapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Results: Median follow-up of the entire sample was 61 months (range, 2-251 months). At 5 years, the overall RFS rate was 86%, and the BCSS rate was 95%. For low-risk patients, the RFS rate was 92%, and the BCSS rate was 98%. For intermediate-risk patients, the RFS rate was 84%, and the BCSS rate was 94%. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of RFS (P = .006) and BCSS (P = .041) independent of received treatment. Conclusion: Using the St. Gallen risk categories resulted in significantly different outcomes for patients with NNBC. The St. Gallen classification might be a valuable clinical tool when assessing patients with NNBC.</docText>

        <docTitle>Reduced Risk of Bone Metastasis for Patients With Breast Cancer Who Use COX-2 Inhibitors.</docTitle>
        <docText>Reduced Risk of Bone Metastasis for Patients With Breast Cancer Who Use COX-2 Inhibitors.

Purpose: We hypothesize that the use of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors in early disease phases could protect against the development of bony metastases. Patients and Methods: The medical charts of patients with stage II-III breast cancer diagnosed between 1999 and 2005 were reviewed. Patients were subdivided according to the use of COX-2 inhibitors after the diagnosis and for &gt;/= 6 months. Bivariate analyses were undertaken, and statistically significant variables were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Eleven percent of patients (74 of 644) who did not use COX-2 inhibitors developed bone metastases compared with 2% (1 of 48) of those who did use COX-2 inhibitors (Fisher exact test, P = .05). Significant predictors for bone metastases in a multivariate logistic regression model included: &gt;/= 3 positive nodes (odds ratio [OR], 3.26 [95% CI, 1.79-5.93]; P &lt; .001), stage IIB-IIIC disease (OR, 3.89 [95% CI: 1.74-8.69]; P = .001) and use of COX-2 inhibitors (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02-0.88]; P = .037). Adjusting for TNM stage, of the 327 patients with stages IIB-IIIC disease, 22% (63 of 293) had bone metastases in the non-COX-2 group versus 3% (1 of 34) in the COX-2 inhibitors consumers (Fisher exact test, P = .006). In this high-risk group of patients, the calculated OR associated with COX-2 inhibitors was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.01-0.78). Conclusion: The use of COX-2 inhibitors could reduce the risk of bone metastases in stage II-III breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Sexual dysfunction and aromatase inhibitor use in survivors of breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Sexual dysfunction and aromatase inhibitor use in survivors of breast cancer.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are now an integral component in the management of postmenopausal adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in women with hormone receptor-positive disease; however, the AI-associated reduction in estrogen levels can increase vaginal/vulvar symptoms and adversely influence sexual function. Although non-hormone-containing local agents with demonstrated efficacy are available, optimal therapy for estrogen deprivation-associated vaginal/vulvar symptoms might require local or systemic estrogen use. However, the safety of systemic estrogen use in the breast cancer setting, especially for women on AIs, has been challenged by recent randomized clinical trial evidence. In addition, maintenance of estrogen levels in the postmenopausal range cannot be assured with local estrogen use. Thus, for postmenopausal women with limiting vaginal/vulvar symptoms on adjuvant AIs that are not manageable with non-hormone-containing agents, a switch to tamoxifen might be preferred rather than adding local or systemic estrogens to the AI regimen.</docText>

        <docText>Panhypopituitarism due to Metastases to the Hypothalamus and the Pituitary Resulting From Primary Breast Cancer: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Pituitary metastasis occurs rarely in cancer patients and often remains undiagnosed. However, early detection and appropriate treatment can improve the patient's quality of life and possibly prolong survival. Herein, we describe the case of a 52-year-old woman with panhypopituitarism caused by metastases to the hypothalamus and pituitary from primary breast cancer. She had a 5-year history of breast cancer with metastases to the bones 1.5 years after initial diagnosis and mastectomy. She presented with severe headaches, generalized fatigue, dizziness, hypotension, difficulties with balance and coordination, polyuria, and polydipsia. Laboratory work-up revealed panhypopituitarism (central diabetes insipidus; hypothyroidism; and low prolactin, gonadotrophin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels), and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the pituitary and hypothalamic involvement. She received hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy of the sella turcica and suprasellar lesion, and chemotherapy, with significant improvement of her clinical status, but she died 15 months later.</docText>

        <docText>Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide versus Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and 5-Fluorouracil as Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.

This study evaluated whether doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are superior to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil as adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Between July 1976 and December 2004, 1045 breast cancer patients received adjuvant chemotherapy at the Radiotherapy Unit of the University of florence. 927 were administered i.v. CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), methotrexate 40 mg/m(2) and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, repeated every 28 days for a total of six cycles) and 118 i.v. DC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) on day 1 repeated every 21 days for a total of four cycles). All patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy as well. The survival analysis, stratified according to treatment, did not show any significant difference in metastasis occurrence between the two groups (log rank test p=0.42). According to multivariate analysis four parameters emerged as independent prognostic factors for distant metastases in patients treated with the Cmf regimen: pt (p=0.0005), number of positive axillary lymph nodes (p=&lt;0.0001), tamoxifen use (p=0.0109) and local relapses (p=&lt;0.0001). Only number of positive axillary lymph nodes and local relapses were significant predictors of metastases occurrence according to multivariate analysis in the DC group, 17 and p=0.028, respectively. No significant difference between the two regimens was observed with regards to number of involved nodes. DC and CMF produced similar outcome in breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Intra-operative use of PET probe for localization of FDG avid lesions.

Localizing positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) findings in heavily scarred surgical fields can be challenging. A high energy gamma probe (PET probe) can be used to guide surgery in those difficult areas. We describe our experience localizing and removing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesions in different body areas. Between 2004 and 2007, we used the PET probe to localize and remove 12 lesions from 9 patients. The lesions were removed confirming ex vivo and tumor bed FDG activity. Five patients had lesions in previously operated and sometimes radiated fields. One patient had FDG avid spots in the retroperitoneum. Two lymphoma patients had been previously treated and had new FDG avid spots in a background of scarred nodes. The last patient had a core biopsy suspicious for lymphoma but a repeat CT was non-specific. One patient with gastric cancer patient, two patients with melanoma patients and two patients with breast cancer had 10 metastatic lesions easily identified and removed. After a median follow-up of 14 months all five patients are alive. The two patients with lymphoma had their FDG avid lymph nodes easily identified and biopsied. In one patient with melanoma and one patient with suspected lymphoma, the preoperative scan revealed no FDG avid lesions. The PET probe confirmed this finding in the operating room. Clinical applications of PET probe guided surgery include restaging for previously treated lymphoma patients, localization and resection of metastatic FDG avid nodules especially in previously operated or radiated fields and biopsy of PET findings difficult to localize.</docText>

        <docTitle>Adjuvant chest wall radiotherapy for breast cancer: Black, white and shades of grey.</docTitle>
        <docText>Adjuvant chest wall radiotherapy for breast cancer: Black, white and shades of grey.

BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chest wall irradiation after mastectomy remains a core and highly effective element in the loco-regional management of early breast cancer. While the evidence base for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with 4 or more involved axillary nodes is robust, its role in 'intermediate' risk patients with 1-3 involved nodes is unclear and practice varies. Traditionally patients have been selected for PMRT on the basis of clinic-pathological factors such tumour size, nodal status, tumour grade and presence of lymphovascular invasion. However these factors alone may not predict the response of individual patients to radiotherapy. There is recent evidence that biological factors such as oestrogen and progesterone receptor and HER-2 status may also influence survival as well as loco-regional control. METHODS: A literature review was undertaken, searching Pubmed using the mesh heading of 'breast cancer' and 'adjuvant chest wall irradiation/radiotherapy'. Priority was given to reports of meta-analyses and randomised trials of postmastectomy radiotherapy. OBSERVATIONS: The 2005 Oxford Overview of randomised trials of postoperative radiotherapy established a clear biological link between loco-regional control and survival. Paradoxically the largest survival benefits do not occur in patients at the highest risk of recurrence. Molecular markers to identify exactly which patients are likely to benefit from PMRT are being actively investigated. Surgeons are encouraged to enter patients with 1-3 involved nodes into a clinical trial of postmastectomy radiotherapy.</docText>

        <docText>The Effect of Early Detection of Occult Brain Metastases in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients on Survival and Cause of Death.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to evaluate disease-free survival, survival from the detection of brain metastases, overall survival, and cause of death in patients with occult brain metastases (Group I) vs. patients with symptomatic brain metastases (Group II). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 80 HER2-positive breast cancer patients, treated with trastuzumab and cytostatic agents for metastatic disease, magnetic resonance imaging screening of the brain was performed, and in 29 patients (36%) occult brain metastasis was detected (Group I). Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered to Group I. This first group was compared with 52 patients who had symptomatic brain metastases (Group II) and was treated the same way, at the same clinic, during the same time period. RESULTS: Median disease-free survival was 17 months in Group I and 19.9 months in Group II (p = 0.58). The median time interval between the dissemination of the disease and the detection of occult or symptomatic brain metastases was 9 and 15 months, respectively (p = 0.11). When the brain metastases were detected, the median survival was 9 and 8.78 months, respectively (p = 0.80). The median overall survival was 53 and 51 months, respectively (p = 0.94). In the group with occult brain metastases (Group I) 16% of patients died because of progression within the brain. In the group with symptomatic brain metastases (Group II) the rate of cerebral death was 48% (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Whole-brain radiotherapy of occult brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with visceral dissemination produces a three-fold decrease in cerebral deaths but does not prolong survival.</docText>

        <docText>In utero and lactational exposure to blueberry via maternal diet promotes mammary epithelial differentiation in prepubescent female rats.

Early developmental events influence the fine tuning of later susceptibility to adult diseases. Diet is a determinant of breast cancer risk, and our previous studies showed that diet-mediated changes in transcriptional programs promote early mammary gland differentiation. Although consumption of fruits is considered to elicit multiple health benefits, little is known on whether associated bioactive components modify the early differentiation program in developing mammary glands. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that early exposure (in utero and lactational) to blueberry through maternal diet enhances mammary epithelial differentiation in female offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats beginning at gestation day 4 were fed American Institute of Nutrition-based diets containing casein and whole blueberry powders added to casein at 2.5%, 5.0%, and 10% weight/weight. Female pups at weaning were evaluated for growth and mammary tissue parameters. Blueberry at 5% dose increased body and adipose fat weights, relative to the other diets. Mammary branch density and terminal end bud size were highest for the 5% blueberry group, whereas terminal end bud numbers were not affected by all diets. Mammary ductal epithelial cells of the 5% blueberry group had lower nuclear phosphorylated histone 3 and higher nuclear tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) levels than the casein group. Although sera of both diet groups had similar antioxidant capacity, 5% blueberry sera elicited higher nuclear PTEN accumulation in human MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. Our studies identify developing mammary glands as early targets of blueberry-associated bioactive components, possibly through systemic effects on epithelial PTEN signaling.</docText>

        <docTitle>Oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells is involved in the effects of retinoic acid-induced activation of protein kinase C-delta on insulin-like growth factor-I secretion and synthesis.</docTitle>
        <docText>Oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells is involved in the effects of retinoic acid-induced activation of protein kinase C-delta on insulin-like growth factor-I secretion and synthesis.

It is known that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is a useful therapeutic anticancer agent in breast cancer that acts by inducing apoptosis and growth inhibition. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is also known to be a growth hormone that plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. We examined the relationships between RA-induced protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, the secretion and synthesis of IGF-I, and oxidative stress. RA at 10(-8)M and 10(-7)M increased PKC-delta phosphorylation (the ratio of phosphorylated to total PKC-delta) (p&lt;0.05) and decreased the secretion and synthesis of IGF-I (p&lt;0.05) compared to control, with the effects peaking for treatment with 10(-7)M RA for 72h. The silencing of PKC-delta prevented the RA-induced inhibition of the secretion and synthesis of IGF-I and cell viability (p&lt;0.05). Application of 10(-7)M RA for 72h increased the level of thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase relative to control (p&lt;0.05). These increases were blocked by suppressing PKC-delta and by pretreatment with the antioxidants glutathione and diphenyleneiodonium (p&lt;0.05). These antioxidants also reversed the RA-induced inhibition of the secretion and synthesis of IGF-I and cell viability to control levels (p&lt;0.05). The effects of suppressing IGF-I demonstrate that IGF-I plays a critical role in the RA-induced inhibition of the cell viability. These results indicate that the anticancer effects of RA are mediated by inhibition of the secretion and synthesis of IGF-I, and involve a PKC-delta-dependent mechanism, and they provide evidence of an interaction between PKC-delta and reactive oxygen species.</docText>

        <docText>Down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Akt induced by combination of photoactivated hypericin and genistein in human breast cancer cells.

Presented experiment considers combination of genistein and photodynamic therapy with hypericin with a view to achieve higher therapeutic outcome in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, both identified in our conditions as photodynamic therapy resistant. Since genistein is known to suppress Bcl-2 expression, we predicted that photodynamic therapy with hypericin might benefit from mutual therapeutic combination. In line with our expectations, combined treatment led to down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax in both cell lines as well as to suppression of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by photoactivated hypericin in MCF-7 cells. Although Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation was not stimulated by photodynamic therapy with hypericin in MDA-MB-231 cells, it was effectively suppressed in combination. Variations in cell death signaling favoring apoptosis were indeed accompanied by cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M-phase, activation of caspase-7, PARP cleavage and increased occurrence of cells with apoptotic morphology of nucleus. All these events corresponded with suppression of proliferation and significantly lowered clonogenic ability of treated cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that pre-treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein may significantly improve the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with hypericin in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.</docText>

        <docText>Bevacizumab in the treatment of breast cancer.

Current evidence indicates that angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, including breast cancer. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Recent clinical data have demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to first-line chemotherapy improves the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced breast cancer. This review presents an update on the clinical studies evaluating the role of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy, as well as other agents, both in advanced and early disease. Moreover, although no definitive biomarkers have been identified so far, we provide current data regarding potentially useful predictive factors for treatment with bevacizumab. In addition, we review the suggested mechanisms that lead to resistance to VEGF targeted therapies and we present recent data with respect to the toxicity of bevacizumab.</docText>

        <docText>Clinical outcome after pulmonary resection for lung cancer patients on hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND: The number of operations for patients with malignant tumors receiving long-term hemodialysis has been increasing; however, there are only few reports about pulmonary resection for the patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2009, 11 hemodialysis patients (6 men, 5 women; mean age, 66.4 years) with non-small cell lung cancer underwent pulmonary resection at our institution. We retrospectively evaluated their postoperative clinical outcomes and long-term results. RESULTS: The underlying kidney conditions included nephrosclerosis in 3, diabetic nephropathy in 3, glomerulonephritis in 1, and polycystic kidney in 1; 3 patients had undergone nephrectomy. The median duration of hemodialysis preoperatively was 5.0 years. Three patients had been treated for previous carcinoma. The histopathologic diagnoses were adenocarcinoma in 9 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in 2. Procedures included lobectomy in 9, pneumonectomy in 1, and wedge resection in 1. There were no in-hospital deaths. Postoperative morbidity included 2 cases of pneumonia and 1 of chylothorax. At the time of our investigation, 6 patients were dead; 2 of cancer and 4 of noncancer causes. The overall 5-year survival rate of 11 patients was 28.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis is not a contraindication to lung resection, despite the high morbidity rate. Surgical treatments, including lobectomy, remain one of effective treatments for patients on hemodialysis with lung cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Does extirpation of the primary breast tumor give boost to growth of metastases? Evidence revealed by mathematical modeling.

A comprehensive mechanistic model of cancer natural history was utilized to obtain an explicit formula for the distribution of volumes of detectable metastases in a given secondary site at any time post-diagnosis. This model provided an excellent fit to the volumes of n = 31, 20 and 15 bone metastases observed in three breast cancer patients 8 years, 5.5 years and 9 months after primary diagnosis, respectively. The model with optimal parameters allowed us to reconstruct the individual natural history of cancer for the first patient. This gave definitive answers, for the patient in question, to the following three questions of major importance in clinical oncology: (1) How early an event is metastatic dissemination of breast cancer? (2) How long is the metastasis latency time? and (3) Does extirpation of the primary breast tumor accelerate the growth of metastases? Specifically, according to the model applied to the first patient, (1) inception of the first metastasis occurred 29.5 years prior to the primary diagnosis; (2) the expected metastasis latency time was about 79.5 years; and (3) resection of the primary tumor was followed by a 32-fold increase in the rate of metastasis growth. The model and our conclusions were validated by the results for the two other patients.</docText>

        <docText>Calcitriol inhibits Ether-à go-go potassium channel expression and cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells.

Antiproliferative actions of calcitriol have been shown to occur in many cell types; however, little is known regarding the molecular basis of this process in breast carcinoma. Ether-à-go-go (Eag1) potassium channels promote oncogenesis and are implicated in breast cancer cell proliferation. Since calcitriol displays antineoplastic effects while Eag1 promotes tumorigenesis, and both factors antagonically regulate cell cycle progression, we investigated a possible regulatory effect of calcitriol upon Eag1 as a mean to uncover new molecular events involved in the antiproliferative activity of this hormone in human breast tumor-derived cells. RT-real time PCR and immunocytochemistry showed that calcitriol suppressed Eag1 expression by a vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent mechanism. This effect was accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation, which was potentiated by astemizole, a nonspecific Eag1 inhibitor. Immunohistochemistry and western blot demonstrated that Eag1 and VDR abundance was higher in invasive-ductal-carcinoma than in fibroadenoma, and immunoreactivity of both proteins was located in ductal epithelial cells. Our results provide evidence of a novel mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effects of calcitriol, and highlights VDR as a cancer therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment and prevention.</docText>

        <docText>Are mastectomy resection margins of clinical relevance? A systematic review.

Although some guidelines support the use of post-mastectomy radiotherapy where the resection margin is involved or close, the scientific basis of this practice is not established. This systematic review explores the relationship between margin status and subsequent relapse. Pooled data from 22 studies (18,863 women) identified an involved post-mastectomy margin in 2.5%, a close margin in 8.0% and muscle or fascia invasion in 7.2% of patients. In a meta-analysis of five studies of non-inflammatory breast cancer without radiotherapy, local recurrence was increased by an involved or close margin (relative risk 2.6; P&lt;0.00001). The effect of muscle or fascia invasion was of borderline significance (relative risk 1.7; P=0.04). In two separate meta-analyses, risk of relapse was related to margin status in women with inflammatory breast cancer (relative risk 3.1; P&lt;0.0001) but not in those undergoing skin-sparing mastectomy (relative risk 2.1; P=0.16).</docText>

        <docText>Anti-tumor activity of a new series of benzoxazepine derivatives in breast cancer.

A series of new benzoxazepine derivatives substituted with different alkoxy and aryloxy group were synthesized comprising synthetic steps of Mitsunobu reaction, lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) reduction, followed by debenzylation and finally intramolecular Mitsunobu cyclization. The new benzoxazepines specifically inhibited growth of breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, but lack cytotoxicity to normal HEK-293 cells. The cell growth inhibition induced by the active compounds was due to cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase. The active compound could cause significant reduction in tumor volume of MCF-7 xenograft tumor in nude mice model and their activity was comparable to that of tamoxifen citrate at 16mgkg(-1) dose at 30days of treatment. The identified most active compounds of the series have specific advantages as anti-cancer agent in breast cancer than tamoxifen.</docText>

        <docText>Factors affecting sentinel lymph node detection failure in breast cancer patients using intradermal injection of the tracer.

OBJECTIVE: The standard method for axillary lymph node staging in early breast cancer is sentinel lymph node biopsy. In some patients the sentinel lymph node can not be localized during surgery and these patients have to undergo standard axillary lymph node dissection. In this study we have evaluated the predictors of sentinel lymph node localization failure using (99m)Tc-antimony sulfide colloid and intradermal injection combined with blue dye technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 202 consecutive patients with early stage breast cancer (clinically stage I or II) were retrospectively evaluated. Patients whose sentinel lymph node was localized during surgery were compared to those with localization failure considering several variables. RESULTS: Sentinel lymph node was successfully located on the pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy images in 180 patients (89%). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that only sentinel lymph node non-visualization by pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy, experience of the surgeon, and axillary lymph node involvement are associated with sentinel node localization failure during surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy in order to identify the group of patients with possible localization failure during surgery and warning the surgeon beforehand. We also recommend that all surgeons pass the learning curve of sentinel lymph node biopsy before routinely performing this procedure.</docText>

        <docTitle>Selective Regulation of Aromatase Expression for Drug Discovery.</docTitle>
        <docText>Selective Regulation of Aromatase Expression for Drug Discovery.

Aromatase is a particularly attractive drug target in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, and aromatase activity in breast cancer patients is greater in or near the tumor tissue compared with the normal breast tissue. Complex regulation of aromatase expression in human tissues involves alternative promoter sites that provide tissue-specific control. Previous studies in our laboratories suggested a strong association between aromatase (CYP19) gene expression and the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) genes. Additionally, COX selective inhibitors can suppress CYP19 gene expression and decrease aromatase activity. Our current hypothesis is that pharmacological regulation of aromatase can act locally to decrease the biosynthesis of estrogen and may provide additional therapy options for patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Two pharmacological approaches are being developed, one approach utilizing small molecule drug design and the second approach involving mRNA silencing technology. The small molecule drug design approach focuses on the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of sulfonanilide analogs derived from COX-2 selective inhibitors. Combinatorial chemistry approaches were used to generate diversely substituted novel sulfonanilides. The compounds suppress aromatase enzyme activity in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells in a dose and time dependent manner, and structure activity analysis does not find a correlation between aromatase suppression and COX inhibition. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that the sulfonanilide analogs decrease aromatase gene transcription in breast cells. Furthermore, the sulfonanilide compounds selectively decrease aromatase gene expression in several breast cancer cells, without exhibiting cytotoxic or apoptotic effects at low micromole concentrations. A ligand based pharmacophore model for selective aromatase modulation (SAM) by the novel sulfonanilides identified an aromatic ring, two hydrogen bond acceptors, and a hydrophobic function as four key chemical features. In the second approach, short interfering RNAs (siRNA) were designed targeting human aromatase mRNA. Treatment of breast cancer cells with siRNAs targeting aromatase (siAROMs) completely masked the aromatase enzyme activity and resulted in suppression of CYP19 mRNA. Thus, these results suggest that the novel sulfonanilides and the siRNAs targeting aromatase expression may be valuable tools for selective regulation of aromatase in breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Oleic acid promotes migration on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through an arachidonic acid-dependent pathway.

An association between dietary fatty, obesity and an increased risk of developing breast cancer has been suggested. In breast cancer cells, free fatty acids (FFAs) mediate biological effects including cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation. However, the contribution of FFAs to tumor progression and metastasis through the regulation of cell migration has not been studied. We demonstrated here that stimulation on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with oleic acid (OA) promotes an increase in FAK phosphorylation, as revealed by site-specific antibodies that recognize the phosphorylation state of FAK at Tyr-397, Tyr-577 and in vitro kinase assays. OA also promotes the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment with Gi/Go proteins, PLC, LOXs and Src inhibitor prevents FAK phosphorylation and cell migration. In summary, our findings delineate a new signal transduction pathway, where OA mediates the production of arachidonic acid (AA), and then AA metabolites mediate FAK phosphorylation and cell migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.</docText>

        <docText>Axillary sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION: The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) with potentially sterilized axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2008, SLNB with both blue-dye and radioisotope injection was performed in 77 patients with LABC whose cytopathologically confirmed positive axillary node(s) became clinically negative after NAC. Factors associated with SLN identification and false-negative rates, presence of non-sentinel lymph node (non-SLN) metastasis were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: SLNB was successful in 92% of the patients. Axillary status was predicted with 90% accuracy and a false-negative rate of 13.7%. Patients with residual tumor size &gt;2cm had a decreased SLN identification rate (p=0.002). Axillary nodal status before NAC (N2 versus N1) was associated with higher false-negative rates (p=0.04). Positive non-SLN(s) were more frequent in patients with multifocal/multicentric tumors (versus unifocal; p=0.003) and positive lymphovascular invasion (versus negative; p=0.0001). SLN(s) positive patients with pathologic tumor size &gt;2cm (versus &lt;/=2cm; p=0.004), positive extra-sentinel lymph node extension (versus negative; p=0.002) were more likely to have metastatic non-SLN(s). CONCLUSIONS: SLNB has a high identification rate and modest false-negative rate in LABC patients who became clinically axillary node negative after NAC. Residual tumor size and nodal status before NAC affect SLNB accuracy. Additional involvement of non-SLN(s) increases with the presence of multifocal/multicentric tumors, lymphovascular invasion, residual tumor size &gt;2cm, and extra-sentinel node extension.</docText>

        <docTitle>The Interaction of Angiocidin with Tissue Transglutaminase.</docTitle>
        <docText>The Interaction of Angiocidin with Tissue Transglutaminase.

Angiocidin, a matrix bound and tumor associated protein, has been shown to inhibit tumor progression and angiogenesis. We previously demonstrated that angiocidin binds to thrombospondin-1 and alpha2beta1 integrin. We now show that angiocidin binds and is a preferred substrate for tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTgase). Angiocidin bound tissue tTgase saturably with a Kd of 26 nM, while an angiocidin deletion mutant missing the matrix binding domain of angiocidin failed to bind tTgase. tTgase colocalized with angiocidin on endothelial cells. tTgase bound anti-angiocidin immunoprecipitates of endothelial cell lysates. Breast cancer cells expressing high levels of tTgase attached to angiocidin immobilized on tissue culture plates. Angiocidin was a preferred substrate for tTgase forming high molecular weight cross-linked multimers when treated with tTgase. Cross-linked angiocidin contained iso-peptide bonds as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunohistochemical colocalization studies using endothelial cells treated with angiocidin. Cross-linked angiocidin inhibited cell migration in contrast to monomeric angiocidin and inhibited localization of fibronectin (FN), a pro-tumorigenic matrix protein, into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumor and HUVE cells. Our studies provide an additional explanation for the anti- tumor activity of angiocidin suggesting that cross-linked angiocidin disrupts the tumor ECM making it less permissive for tumor growth.</docText>

        <docText>Matrix Crosslinking Forces Tumor Progression by Enhancing Integrin Signaling.

Tumors are characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and stiffening. The importance of ECM remodeling to cancer is appreciated; the relevance of stiffening is less clear. We found that breast tumorigenesis is accompanied by collagen crosslinking, ECM stiffening, and increased focal adhesions. Induction of collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM, promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity, and induced the invasion of an oncogene-initiated epithelium. Inhibition of integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling, and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium. Consistently, reduction of lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking prevented MMTV-Neu-induced fibrosis, decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity, impeded malignancy, and lowered tumor incidence. These data show how collagen crosslinking can modulate tissue fibrosis and stiffness to force focal adhesions, growth factor signaling and breast malignancy.</docText>

        <docText>Using Lifetime Risk Estimates in Personal Genomic Profiles: Estimation of Uncertainty.

Personal genome tests are now offered direct-to-consumer (DTC) via genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for common diseases. Tests report risk estimates (age-specific and lifetime) for various diseases based on genotypes at multiple loci. However, uncertainty surrounding such risk estimates has not been systematically investigated. With breast cancer as an example, we examined the combined effect of uncertainties in population incidence rates, genotype frequency, effect sizes, and models of joint effects among genetic variants on lifetime risk estimates. We performed simulations to estimate lifetime breast cancer risk for carriers and noncarriers of genetic variants. We derived population-based cancer incidence rates from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and comparative international data. We used data for non-Hispanic white women from 2003 to 2005. We derived genotype frequencies and effect sizes from published GWAS and meta-analyses. For a single genetic variant in FGFR2 gene (rs2981582), combination of uncertainty in these parameters produced risk estimates where upper and lower 95% simulation intervals differed by more than 3-fold. Difference in population incidence rates was the largest contributor to variation in risk estimates. For a panel of five genetic variants, estimated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer before age 80 for a woman that carried all risk variants ranged from 6.1% to 21%, depending on assumptions of additive or multiplicative joint effects and breast cancer incidence rates. Epidemiologic parameters involved in computation of disease risk have substantial uncertainty, and cumulative uncertainty should be properly recognized. Reliance on point estimates alone could be seriously misleading.</docText>

        <docText>Internal mammary lymph node irradiation contributes to heart dose in breast cancer.

We assessed the impact of internal mammary chain radiotherapy (IMC RT) to the radiation dose received by the heart in terms of heart dose-volume histogram (DVH). Thirty-six consecutive breast cancer patients presenting with indications for IMC RT were enrolled in a prospective study. The IMC was treated by a standard conformal RT technique (50 Gy). For each patient, a cardiac DVH was generated by taking into account the sole contribution of IMC RT. Cardiac HDV were compared according to breast cancer laterality and the type of previous surgical procedure, simple mastectomy or breast conservative therapy (BCT). The contribution of IMC RT to the heart dose was significantly greater for patients with left-sided versus right-sided tumors (13.8% and 12.8% for left-sided tumors versus 3.9% and 4.2% for right-sided tumors in the BCT group and the mastectomy group, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in IMC contribution depending on the initial surgical procedure. IMC RT contributes to cardiac dose for both left-sided and right-sided breast cancers, although the relative contribution is greater in patients with left-sided tumors.</docText>

        <docText>Superiority of equivalent uniform dose (EUD)-based optimization for breast and chest wall*

We investigate whether IMRT optimization based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) objectives for organs at risk (OAR) results in superior dosimetric outcomes when compared with multiple dose-volume (DV)-based objectives plans for patients with intact breast and postmastectomy chest wall (CW) cancer. Four separate IMRT plans were prepared for each of the breast and CW cases (10 patients). The first three plans used our standard in-house, physician-selected, DV objectives (phys-plan); gEUD-based objectives for the OARs (gEUD-plan); and multiple, "very stringent," DV objectives for eachOAR and PTV (DV-plan), respectively. The fourth plan was only beam-fluence optimized (FO-plan), without segmentation, which used the same objectives as in the DV-plan. The latter plan was to be used as an "optimum" benchmark without the effects of the segmentation for deliverability. Dosimetric quantities, such as V(20Gy)for the ipsilateral lung and mean dose (D(mean)) for heart, contralateral breast, and contralateral lung were used to evaluate the results. For all patients in this study, we have seen that the gEUD-based plans allow greater sparing of the OARs while maintaining equivalent target coverage. The average ipsilateral lung V(20Gy) reduced from 22 +/- 4.4% for the FO-plan to 18 +/- 3% for the gEUD-plan. All other dosimetric quantities shifted towards lower doses for the gEUD-plan. gEUD-based optimization can be used to search for plans of different DVHs with the same gEUDs. The use of gEUD allows selective optimization and reduction of the dose for each OAR and results in a truly individualized treatment plan.</docText>

        <docText>Radiation therapy and breast cancer risk.

Exposure to ionizing radiation has clearly been established as one of the risk factors for the development of breast cancer. Much data on the relationship between radiation exposures and subsequent breast cancer are derived from atomic bomb survivors and women who received medical exposures either for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Although these populations differ in background breast cancer risks and the dose, quality, and timing of radiation, consistent findings include an increased risk with younger age at exposure, long latency to breast cancer development, and increasing risk with increasing radiation dose. Although therapeutic radiation is rarely used to treat benign conditions, it remains an important and effective treatment modality for a wide range of cancers. Increased knowledge of radiation-related breast cancer and modifying influences plays an important role in guiding the initial treatment approach for young women and optimizing long-term follow-up care.</docText>

        <docText>The role of MRI in breast cancer screening.

The 2009 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis include significant updates for the role of MRI in screening women at increased risk for breast cancer. The NCCN now recommends considering breast MRI as an adjunct to annual mammography and clinical breast examination for women who have a BRCA1 or -2 mutation or who have a first-degree relative who has a BRCA1 or -2 mutation but who have not undergone genetic testing themselves; those who are determined to have a lifetime risk greater than 20% based on models that are highly dependent on family history; and those with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ. MRI is also recommended for patients who underwent radiation treatment to the chest between 10 and 30 years of age, and in those who carry or have a first-degree relative who carries a genetic mutation in the TP53 or PTEN genes (Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, and Bannahyan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes). MRI is specifically not recommended for screening women at average risk for breast cancer. This article describes the peer-reviewed, published clinical research trials evaluating breast MRI in high-risk patients, on which the NCCN guidelines were based, and provides suggestions for future research.</docText>

        <docText>Trends in breast cancer treatment in the elderly at a breast cancer outpatient clinic: guidelines followed better.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the treatment of resectable breast cancer in elderly patients at Alkmaar Medical Centre, Alkmaar, the Netherlands, before and after the introduction of a multidisciplinary breast cancer consultation (MDC) with the breast cancer team in February 2006. DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: The treatment of patients aged 70 and over with newly diagnosed stage I and II resectable breast cancer was monitored during the period 2002-2007. RESULTS: A total of 84% of the 232 studied patients were treated surgically. Adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy was given to 88, 91 and 5 patients, respectively. The percentage of patients who underwent first-line surgery decreased significantly, mainly because fewer patients aged 80 or over received surgery. The number of patients given radiotherapy in accordance with guidelines increased, while for hormonal therapy the number remained more or less the same. Recording of decisions that involved deviation from treatment guidelines improved in the study period. CONCLUSION: In 2002-2007, the breast cancer team became more aware of treatment guidelines and deviations from guidelines were better accounted for. In the elderly, the guidelines for adjuvant radiotherapy were followed better, but there was a remarkable decrease in primary surgical treatment of patients, particularly in patients aged 80 and over. Comorbidity and patients' preferences played an important role in this.</docText>

        <docText>Nuclear detection of Y-box protein-1 (YB-1) closely associates with progesterone receptor negativity and is a strong adverse survival factor in human breast cancer.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is the prototypic member of the cold shock protein family that fulfills numerous cellular functions. In the nucleus YB-1 protein orchestrates transcription of proliferation-related genes, whereas in the cytoplasm it associates with mRNA and directs translation. In human tumor entities, such as breast, lung and prostate cancer, cellular YB-1 expression indicates poor clinical outcome, suggesting that YB-1 is an attractive marker to predict patients' prognosis and, potentially, is suitable to individualize treatment protocols. Given these predictive qualities of YB-1 detection we sought to establish a highly specific monoclonal antibody (Mab) for diagnostic testing and its characterization towards outcome prediction (relapse-free and overall survival). METHODS: Hybridoma cell generation was carried out with recombinant YB-1 protein as immunogen and Mab characterization was performed using immunoblotting and ELISA with recombinant and tagged YB-1 proteins, as well as immunohistochemistry of healthy and breast cancer specimens. Breast tumor tissue array staining results were analyzed for correlations with receptor expression and outcome parameters. RESULTS: YB-1-specific Mab F-E2G5 associates with conformational binding epitopes mapping to two domains within the N-terminal half of the protein and detects nuclear YB-1 protein by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues. Prognostic evaluation of Mab F-E2G5 was performed by immunohistochemistry of a human breast cancer tissue microarray comprising 179 invasive breast cancers, 8 ductal carcinoma in situ and 37 normal breast tissue samples. Nuclear YB-1 detection in human breast cancer cells was associated with poor overall survival (p=0.0046). We observed a close correlation between nuclear YB-1 detection and absence of progesterone receptor expression (p=0.002), indicating that nuclear YB-1 detection marks a specific subgroup of breast cancer. Likely due to limitation of sample size Cox regression models failed to demonstrate significance for nuclear YB-1 detection as independent prognostic marker. CONCLUSIONS: Monoclonal YB-1 antibody F-E2G5 should be of great value for prospective studies to validate YB-1 as a novel biomarker suitable to optimize breast cancer treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Impact of biospecimens handling on biomarker research in breast cancer.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling is moving from the research setting to the practical clinical use. Gene signatures able to correctly identify high risk breast cancer patients as well as to predict response to treatment are currently under intense investigation. While technical issues dealing with RNA preparation, choice of array platforms, statistical analytical tools are taken into account, the tissue collection process is seldom considered. The time elapsed between surgical tissue removal and freezing of samples for biological characterizations is rarely well defined and/or recorded even for recently stored samples, despite the publications of standard operating procedures for biological sample collection for tissue banks. METHODS: Breast cancer samples from 11 patients were collected immediately after surgical removal and subdivided into aliquots. One was immediately frozen and the others were maintained at room temperature for respectively 2, 6 and 24 hrs. RNA was extracted and gene expression profile was determined using cDNA arrays. Phosphoprotein profiles were studied in parallel. RESULTS: Delayed freezing affected the RNA quality only in 3 samples, which were not subjected to gene profiling. In the 8 breast cancer cases with apparently intact RNA also in sample aliqiuots frozen at delayed times, 461 genes were modulated simply as a function of freezing timing. Some of these genes were included in gene signatures biologically and clinically relevant for breast cancer. Delayed freezing also affected detection of phosphoproteins, whose pattern may be crucial for clinical decision on target-directed drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Time elapsed between surgery and freezing of samples appears to have a strong impact and should be considered as a mandatory variable to control for clinical implications of inadequate tissue handling.</docText>

        <docText>Glycosylated VCAM-1 isoforms revealed in 2D westerns of HUVECs treated with tumoral soluble factors of breast cancer cells.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Several common aspects of endothelial phenotype such as the expression of cell adhesion molecules, are shared between metastasis and inflammation. Here, we analyzed VCAM-1 variants as biological markers of these two types of endothelial cell activation. With the combination of 2-DE and western blot techniques and the aid of tunicamycin, we analyzed N-glycosylation variants of VCAM-1 in primary human endothelial cells stimulated with either TNF or tumoral soluble factors (TSF's) derived from the human breast cancer cell line ZR75.30. RESULTS: Treatments induced a pro-adhesive endothelial phenotype. 2D western analysis of cells subjected to both treatments revealed the expression of the two known VCAM-1 isoforms and of previously unknown isoforms. In particular TSFZR75.30 induced an isoform with a relative molecular mass (Mr) and isoelectric point (pI) of 77 kDa and 5.0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The unknown isoforms of VCAM-1 that were found to be overexpressed after treatment with TSF's compared with TNF, could serve as biomarkers to discriminate between inflammation and metastasis. 2D westerns revealed three new VCAM-1 isoforms expressed in primary human endothelial cells in response to TSF's stimulation. Each of these isoforms varies in Mr and pI and could be the result of differential glycosylation states.</docText>

        <docTitle>Polymorphisms in the xenobiotic transporter Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1) gene and interaction with meat intake in relation to risk of colorectal cancer in a Danish prospective case-cohort study.</docTitle>
        <docText>Polymorphisms in the xenobiotic transporter Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1) gene and interaction with meat intake in relation to risk of colorectal cancer in a Danish prospective case-cohort study.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The xenobiotic transporters, Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1/ABCB1) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2) may restrict intestinal absorption of various carcinogens, including heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) derived prostaglandins promote gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, affecting angiogenesis, apoptosis, and invasiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate if polymorphisms in these genes were associated with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), and to investigate possible interactions with lifestyle factors such as smoking, meat consumption, and NSAID use. METHODS: The following polymorphisms were analyzed; a synonymous MDR1 C3435T (rs1045642) in exon 26, G-rs3789243-A in intron 3, the functional BCRP C421A (rs2231142), the two COX-2 A-1195G (rs689466) and G-765C (rs20417) in the promoter region, and the COX-2 T8473C (rs5275) polymorphisms in the 3'-untranslated region. The polymorphisms were assessed together with lifestyle factors in a nested case-cohort study of 364 cases and a random cohort sample of 772 participants from the Danish prospective Diet, Cancer and Health study. RESULTS: Carriers of the variant allele of MDR1 intron 3 polymorphism were at 1.52-fold higher risk of CRC than homozygous wild type allele carriers (Incidence rate ratio (IRR) =1.52, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 1.12-2.06). Carriers of the variant allele of MDR1 C3435T exon 26 had a lower risk of CRC than homozygous C-allele carriers (IRR= 0.71 (CI:0.50-1.00)). There was interaction between these MDR1 polymorphisms and intake of red and processed meat in relation to CRC risk. Homozygous MDR1 C3435T C-allele carriers were at 8% increased risk pr 25 gram meat per day (CI: 1.00-1.16) whereas variant allele carriers were not at increased risk (p for interaction = 0.02). COX-2 and BCRP polymorphisms were not associated with CRC risk. There was interaction between NSAID use and MDR1 C3435T and COX-2 T8473C (p-values for interaction 0.001 and 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Two polymorphisms in MDR1 were associated with CRC risk and there was interaction between these polymorphisms and meat intake in relation to CRC risk. Our results suggest that MDR1 polymorphisms affect the relationship between meat and CRC risk.</docText>

        <docText>Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of endophytic fungi isolated from plants at the National Park, Pahang, Malaysia.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Endophytes, microorganisms which reside in plant tissues, have potential in producing novel metabolites for exploitation in medicine. Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of a total of 300 endophytic fungi were investigated. METHODS: Endophytic fungi were isolated from various parts of 43 plants from the National Park Pahang, Malaysia. Extracts from solid state culture were tested for cytotoxicity against a number of cancer cell lines using the MTT assay. Antibacterial activity was determined using the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 300 endophytes were isolated from various parts of plants from the National Park, Pahang. 3.3% of extracts showed potent (IC50 &lt; 0.01 ug/ml) cytotoxic activity against the murine leukemic P388 cell line and 1.7% against a human chronic myeloid leukemic cell line K562. Sporothrix sp. (KK29FL1) isolated from Costus speciosus showed strong cytotoxicity against colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cell lines with IC50 values of 0.05 ug/ml and 0.02 ug/ml, respectively. Antibacterial activity was demonstrated for 8% of the extracts. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the potential for production of bioactive agents from endophytes of the tropical rainforest flora.</docText>

        <docText>The Int7G24A variant of transforming growth factor-beta receptor type I is a risk factor for colorectal cancer in the male Spanish population: a case-control study.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Int7G24A variant of transforming growth factor-beta receptor type I (TGFBR1) has been shown to increase the risk for kidney, ovarian, bladder, lung and breast cancers. Its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been established. The aims of this study were to assess the association of TGFBR1*Int7G24A variant with CRC occurrence, patient age, gender, tumour location and stage. METHODS: We performed a case-control study with 504 cases of sporadic CRC; and 504 non-cancerous age, gender and ethnically matched controls. Genotyping analysis was performed using allelic discrimination assay by real time PCR. RESULTS: The Int7G24A variant was associated with increased CRC incidence in an additive model of inheritance (P for trend = 0.005). No significant differences were found between Int7G24A genotypes and tumour location or stage. Interestingly, the association of the Int7G24A variant with CRC risk was significant in men (odds ratio 4.10 with 95% confidence intervals 1.41-11.85 for homozygous individuals; P for trend = 0.00023), but not in women. We also observed an increase in susceptibility to CRC for individuals aged less than 70 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the Int7G24A variant represents a risk factor for CRC in the male Spanish population.</docText>

        <docText>Characterisation of microRNA expression in post-natal mouse mammary gland development.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The differential expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) during mammary gland development might provide insights into their role in regulating the homeostasis of the breast epithelium. Our aim was to analyse these regulatory functions by deriving a comprehensive tissue-specific combined miRNA and mRNA expression profile of post-natal mouse mammary gland development. We measured the expression of 318 individual murine miRNAs by bead-based flow-cytometric profiling of whole mouse mammary glands throughout a 16-point developmental time course, including juvenile, puberty, mature virgin, gestation, lactation, and involution stages. In parallel whole-genome mRNA expression data were obtained. RESULTS: One third (n = 102) of all murine miRNAs analysed were detected during mammary gland development. MicroRNAs were represented in seven temporally co-expressed clusters, which were enriched for both miRNAs belonging to the same family and breast cancer-associated miRNAs. Global miRNA and mRNA expression was significantly reduced during lactation and the early stages of involution after weaning. For most detected miRNA families we did not observe systematic changes in the expression of predicted targets. For miRNA families whose targets did show changes, we observed inverse patterns of miRNA and target expression. The datasets are made publicly available and the combined expression profiles represent an important community resource for mammary gland biology research. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs were expressed in likely co-regulated clusters during mammary gland development. Breast cancer-associated miRNAs were significantly enriched in these clusters. The mechanism and functional consequences of this miRNA co-regulation provide new avenues for research into mammary gland biology and generate candidates for functional validation.</docText>

        <docText>Treatment-focused DNA testing for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients: some implications for clinical practice.

There is accumulating evidence that women with breast cancer due to a familial BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation benefit from specific surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment strategies. However, the rapid identification of such patients during the acute phase of treatment raises a number of issues. This study investigated Australian opinion leaders' views on the issues arising from such 'treatment-focused' genetic testing. Semi-structured interviews with 34 opinion leaders working in cancer genetics were undertaken. Interviewees acknowledged the introduction of treatment-focused DNA testing has the potential to positively transform the management of breast cancer patients, but were concerned that certain ethical and logistical issues have yet to be addressed. These include decision-making and consent, the familial nature of genetic information, and the management of genetics services within familial cancer clinics in the public hospital system in Australia. Service providers will need to have policies and strategies for managing the increased demand. It will also be necessary to include genetic counseling services within familial cancer clinics in the care pathway for newly diagnosed patients prior to any DNA testing to determine adjuvant treatment; such services may be more cost-effective than expecting surgeons and medical oncologists to fulfill this role.</docText>

        <docText>Anaphylaxis to patent blue V: a case series and proposed diagnostic protocol.

Patent blue V is widely used in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer and other malignancies. Individual case reports of allergy to patent blue V have been described in the medical literature since the 1960s. However, there is little data on clinical features and little experience of which allergy tests are appropriate or useful. We gathered all cases of patent blue V allergy that had been seen and diagnosed in the Department of Allergy, Addenbrooke's Hospital over a 3-year period. We collected clinical details of each case including skin test results. For comparison we recruited 12 healthy control subjects who then underwent skin testing to patent blue V. Six cases of patent blue V allergy were identified, all occurring during sentinel lymph node identification for breast carcinoma. All 6 had positive skin prick tests to neat patent blue V (25 mg/ml). Skin prick testing with a 1 : 10 dilution (2.5 mg/ml) produced positive results in 3 of 4 patients tested, and intradermal testing at a 1 : 100 dilution was (0.25 mg/ml) was positive in all patients tested. Of 12 control subjects, 11 had negative skin prick tests to both neat and 1 : 10 patent blue V with one subject showing a positive reaction to the higher concentration only. On the basis of our experience of patent blue V allergy, we propose a diagnostic protocol that can be safely and reliably utilised in centres equipped for allergy testing.</docText>

        <docText>Mapping oncology services in regional and rural Australia.

Objective: To map clinical oncology services in regional and rural Australia. Design and setting: A self-administered survey was sent to 161 regional hospitals administering chemotherapy (RHAC) in Australia. RHAC were categorised by state, Hospital Peer Group and the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) Remoteness Areas classification. Main outcome measure(s): Survey data provided percentage and aggregate figures about availability of medical, radiation and surgical oncologists, chemotherapy nurses, breast cancer nurses, palliative care physicians and allied health professionals according to remoteness and state. Chemotherapy prescribing practices, adherence to occupational health and safety guidelines and availability of multidisciplinary clinics were also explored. Results: A 98% survey completion rate was achieved. Significant deficiencies in service provision were identified in RHAC. Only 21% of RHAC reported a resident medical oncology service, 7% had a radiation oncology unit, and 6% had a resident surgical oncologist. Only 24% of RHAC reported a dedicated palliative care specialist and 39% identified a dedicated oncology counselling service. Other issues included administration of chemotherapy by nurses outside a recognised facility or by nurses without recognised oncology training, limited availability of funded breast care nurses and lack of multidisciplinary clinics. Conclusion: Survey data highlight marked cancer service deficiencies in rural and regional Australia. It is not unreasonable to conclude that these deficiencies might contribute to poorer outcomes for cancer patients living in these areas. The results suggest the need for short- and long-term measures to improve access to best-practice cancer services for patients living in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia.</docText>

        <docText>Early Response to Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy in Carcinoma of the Breast Predicts Both Successful Breast-Conserving Surgery and Decreased Risk of Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence.

Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy enables us to increase the possibility of breast-conserving surgery for large, bulky tumors. However, several studies have reported that ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTRs) occur more frequently after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy than originally envisaged. Recently, it was demonstrated that clinical early response after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy predicts pathological complete response. In this study, we assessed the association of clinical early response after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with successful breast-conserving surgery and IBTR risk. Between 1995 and 2002, 114 patients with T 3.1-6 cm, N 0 or 1, M 0 breast cancer who were candidates for mastectomy but desired breast-conserving surgery were treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. After two cycles of anthracycline-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and before surgery, breast tumors were measured by palpation or ultrasound. Clinical response after two cycles of chemotherapy was defined as positive when the largest tumor dimension was reduced by 30% or greater. Median follow-up time was 72 months. After two cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, 54 (47.4%) of 114 patients achieved an early response. Patients with the early response underwent breast-conserving surgery significantly more frequently than those without the early response (78% versus 58%, p = 0.03). In addition, the early response was significantly correlated with selection of breast-conserving surgery (odds ratio 3.8, p = 0.01) after adjustments for various clinicopathological factors. Patients without the early response showed significantly lower 6-year IBTR-free survival than patients with the early response (75% versus 97%, p = 0.02). In addition, patients with the early response showed significantly higher 6-year disease-free survival rates than those with the early response (p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that the early response was a predictive factor of IBTR-free survival, being independent of other clinicopathological factors. In conclusion, the early response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy may be a useful predictor of both selection of surgical method and IBTR risk.</docText>

        <docTitle>Discontinuation of Radiation Treatment among Medicaid-Enrolled Women with Local and Regional Stage Breast Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Discontinuation of Radiation Treatment among Medicaid-Enrolled Women with Local and Regional Stage Breast Cancer.

For women with nonmetastatic breast cancer, radiation therapy is recommended as a necessary component of the breast conserving surgery (BCS) treatment option. The degree to which Medicaid-enrolled women complete recommended radiation therapy protocols is not known. We evaluate radiation treatment completion rates for Medicaid enrollees aged 18-64 diagnosed with breast cancer. We determine clinical and socio-demographic factors associated with not starting treatment, and with interruptions or not completing radiation treatment. Using data from the Washington State Cancer Registry linked to Medicaid enrollment and claims records, we identified Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with breast cancer from 1997 to 2003 who received BCS. Among the 402 women who met inclusion criteria, 105 (26%) did not receive any radiation. Factors significantly associated with not receiving radiation included in situ disease and non-English as a primary language. Among those who received at least one radiation treatment, 65 (22%) failed to complete therapy and 71 (24%) patients had at least one 5 to 30 day gap in treatment. We found no significant predictors of interruptions in treatment or early discontinuation. A substantial proportion of Medicaid-insured women who are eligible for radiation therapy following BCS either fail to receive any treatment, experience significant interruptions during therapy, or do not complete a minimum course of treatment. More effort is needed to ensure this vulnerable population receives adequate radiation following BCS.</docText>

        <docText>Binary and ternary crystal structure analyses of a novel inhibitor with 17beta-HSD type 1: a lead compound for breast cancer therapy.

Oestradiol is a well-characterized sex hormone that stimulates breast cancer and other oestrogen-related diseases. 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) catalyses the last step in the synthesis of oestradiol and androstenediol in breast tumour tissue. The enzyme's high expression and activity after simultaneous blockade of oestrogen receptors and inhibition of aromatase in the tumour shows the necessity for its inhibition as a requirement for breast cancer therapy. In the present paper, we report structures of the binary and ternary complexes of 17beta-HSD1 with a new inhibitor E2B {3-[3',17'beta-dihydroxyestra-1',3',5'(10')-trien-16'beta-methyl]benzamide}, and the enzyme inhibition by the later. The IC50 value for E2B was determined to be 42 nM in T47D cells. Multiple interactions between E2B and the enzyme include hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as pi-pi interactions. A kinetic study demonstrated that E2B inhibits the enzyme's reduction forming oestradiol from oestrone, with a Ki of 0.9+/-0.15 nM. Such strong inhibition is in agreement with its extensive interaction with the enzyme, suggesting its potential as a lead compound for breast cancer therapy. In fact, this possibility is enhanced by its capacity for cell penetration similar to natural steroids. Such inhibitors that block oestrogen synthesis to suppress the sulfatase pathway producing oestradiol can be used in adjuvant therapies with oestrogen receptor blockade, opening a new orientation of breast cancer treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Overview of Naphthalimide Analogs as Anticancer Agents.

Cancer, which accounted for 7.9 million deaths (around 13% of all deaths) in 2007, is a leading cause of death in the world. Deaths from cancer worldwide are projected to continue rising, with an estimated 12 million deaths in 2030. Therefore, the rapid increase in the cancer burden represents a real crisis for public health and health systems worldwide. Although cancer chemotherapy will cause side effects and drug resistance, it is still recognized as the first choice for the treatment of many cancers. To our knowledge, naphthalimide (1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3-(2H)-dione) analogs have been considered as one promising and potential class of anticancer agents against human tumor cells, such as amonafide (Quinamed(R)) was the first naphthalimide analog that reached the clinical trial stage and exhibited excellent antitumour activity against advanced breast cancer. In this review, we make attempts to report recent advances on the synthesis of naphthalimide analogs, including mononaphthalimides, bisnaphthalimides, and naphthalimide-other heterocycles conjugates; in the meantime, the relationships between the structures of the naphthalimides and the antitumour activity are investigated in detail. It will pave the way for the design and development of naphthalimide analogs as anticancer agents.</docText>

        <docText>Thyroid hormone effect on human mitochondria measured by flow cytometry.

Abstract Background: Mitochondrial function may be impaired in a number of diseases including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and endocrine disorders. Therefore it is important to be able to measure mitochondrial function in human cells. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate a method to measure mitochondrial function in human derived cells, which also would reflect regulation by thyroid hormones. Methods: The MDA-MB-231 cell line (a human breast cancer cell line) was incubated with bioactive iodothyronines (T(4), 3'-3, 5-T(3), 3, 5-T(2)) 50nmol/l for 3 h. Mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP) were measured by a flow cytometer after staining with Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). Also, the effect of TRIAC (a stimulator of thyroid hormone nuclear receptors) and L-Carnitine (an inhibitor of thyroid hormone passage into the nucleus) was examined. Findings: It was possible to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in human derived cells and to examine thyroid hormone effects using flow cytometry. Bioactive iodothyronines increased mitochondrial membrane potential. TRIAC had no effect and L-Carnitine only inhibited T(4) stimulation of membrane potential. Conclusion: Flow cytometry may be a valuable method for examining and testing mitochondrial function in human cells. Our findings demonstrate increase of mitochondrial membrane potential and an extra nuclear short time effect of 3, 5-T(2) on mitochondrial activity.</docText>

        <docTitle>HER2 Polymorphisms and Breast Cancer in Tunisian Women.</docTitle>
        <docText>HER2 Polymorphisms and Breast Cancer in Tunisian Women.

HER2 has been thought to play a critical role in both breast cancer development and progression. Any functional polymorphisms can potentially affect breast cancer risk as well as cancer phenotype and outcome. In our study, we analyzed three polymorphisms in the HER2 gene: the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) HER2 Ile(655)Val as well as another SNP (rs903506) close to it and a new screened dinucleotide repeat H(AC)I4 in intron 4, in a sample of 148 cases and 290 controls from the Tunisian population and investigated their association with breast cancer risk. For the HER2 Ile(655)Val, we found similar allele frequencies between cases and controls (frequency of I allele was 0.92 and 0.91, respectively). The same was observed for the noncoding SNP (rs903506). These two SNPs also showed no association with any clinical parameters, except the association of HER2 Ile(655)Val with tumor size (p = 0.002). But, a significant association was found between the short tandem repeat (STR) [H(AC)I4] and breast cancer risk at both genotypic and allelic levels (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression of disease status on genotypes of the three polymorphisms confirmed the association of STR with breast cancer risk (p = 0.016). Therefore, this STR seems to be a promising biomarker in breast cancer and deserves further investigation.</docText>

        <docText>A Pilot Study of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Knowledge Among a Multiethnic Group of Hispanic Women with a Personal or Family History of Cancer.

Purpose: To examine knowledge about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) among Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban women. Methods: Women (age range, 18-65 years) with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer were recruited to a mixed methods study using community-based approaches. Fifty-three women participated in the study: 16 Mexicans, 20 Puerto Ricans, and 17 Cubans. The majority of women (64.2%) were born outside the United States. All questions were interviewer administered in Spanish or English. HBOC knowledge was measured using an 11-item instrument developed by the National Center for Human Genome Research. We evaluated whether differences in knowledge varied as a function of Hispanic subethnicity, demographic characteristics, and medical and acculturation characteristics using a series of one-way analysis of variances. Results: The percentage of correct responses on the knowledge instrument ranged from 9.4% to 73.6% (median number of correct responses = 45%). Knowledge did not significantly differ by Hispanic subethnicity (p = 0.51). Exploratory analysis revealed lower knowledge in women with a personal history of cancer (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our study provides important information about characteristics associated with lower levels of knowledge and specific areas related to HBOC where additional education may be warranted in the Hispanic community.</docText>

        <docText>Flavonoids from the Heartwood of the Thai Medicinal Plant Dalbergia parviflora and Their Effects on Estrogenic-Responsive Human Breast Cancer Cells.

From the heartwood of Dalbergia parviflora, eight new compounds, khrinones A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), and E (5), isodarparvinol B (6), dalparvin (7), and (3S)-sativanone (22), along with 32 known compounds, have been isolated and characterized as 17 isoflavones, nine isoflavanones, five flavanones, six isoflavans, and three miscellaneous substances. Isolates were evaluated for their cell proliferation stimulatory activity against the MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cell lines, and their luciferase inductive effects using luciferase transiently transfected MCF-7/luc and T47D/luc cells were also determined. Isoflavones such as genistein (10), biochanin A (11), tectorigenin (12), and 2'-methoxyformononetin (13) stimulated the proliferation of both cells, and concentrations of lower than 1 muM of these compounds showed equivalent activity to 10 pM of estradiol (E2). The new isoflavanone (22) also showed activity against both cell types, although it was weaker than that of the corresponding isoflavone (2'-methoxyformononetin, 13). Two optically active isoflavanones (22 and 24: (3S)-violanone) stimulated the proliferation of both cell lines at lower concentrations than three racemates (21: vestitone, 23: 7,3'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanone, and 25: 3-O-methylviolanone). Bowdichione (20), an isoflavone with a quinone structure in its B-ring, showed activity against only one cell line associated with MCF-7 in these assays.</docText>

        <docTitle>Resveratrol Modulates Tumor Cell Proliferation and Protein Translation via SIRT1-Dependent AMPK Activation.</docTitle>
        <docText>Resveratrol Modulates Tumor Cell Proliferation and Protein Translation via SIRT1-Dependent AMPK Activation.

Resveratrol functions as an agonist for estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription. However, other researchers have reported that resveratrol decreases proliferation of breast cancer cells that are either ER-positive or ER-negative, which suggests that the interaction of resveratrol with the ER may not fully explain its inhibitory effect on proliferation. Similar to those effects associated with caloric restriction (CR), resveratrol has multiple beneficial activities, such as increased life span and delay in the onset of diseases associated with aging. One key enzyme thought to be activated during CR is the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energy levels. The suppression of nonessential energy expenditure by activated AMPK along with the CR mimetic and antiproliferative properties of resveratrol has led us to hypothesize that resveratrol activity might have an important role in the activation of AMPK. Here, we show that resveratrol activated AMPK in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells. Once activated, AMPK inhibited 4E-BP1 signaling and mRNA translation via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Moreover, we also found that AMPK activity mediated by resveratrol in cancer cells was due to inducing the expression of Sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1) via elevation in the cellular NAD(+)/NADH in ER-positive cells. To our knowledge, we demonstrate here for the first time that resveratrol induces the expression of SIRT1 protein in human cancer cells. These observations raise the possibility that SIRT1 functions as a novel upstream regulator for AMPK signaling and may additionally modulate tumor cell proliferation. Targeting SIRT1/AMPK signaling by resveratrol may have potential therapeutic implications for cancer and age-related diseases.</docText>

        <docText>Accidental diagnosis of Klinefelter's syndrome in a young male with sudden dyspnoea--case report

Klinefelter's syndrome is the most common genetically determined cause of male infertility. It is also connected with higher risk of many diseases such as cardiovascular disorders and malignant tumors as breast cancer and germinal tumors. As a consequence of phenotypic variability, still the majority of cases remains undiagnosed. CASE REPORT: 24 years old male who was admitted to the department because of an episode of sudden resting dyspnoea with the coexisting pain in the retrosternal region and a state of anxiety. Performed examinations did not confirm the diagnosis of heart muscle dysfunction and pulmonary embolism either. However, we noticed the constellation of the specific phenotype features of this patient: high stature, gynecomastia, abdominal obesity, poor hair growth in genital regions. The hormonal tests were performed that allowed to diagnose the hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Cytogenetic examination revealed the abnormal karyotype of 47,XXY. CONCLUSIONS: There are no clear references as to diagnosing the Klinefelter's syndrome. Probably, like in this case report, in the majority of cases the diagnosis is accidental.</docText>

        <docText>Malignant lesion segmentation in contrast-enhanced breast MR images based on the marker-controlled watershed.

Breast tumor volume measured on MRI has been used to assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, accurate and reproducible delineation of breast lesions can be challenging, since the lesions may have complicated topological structures and heterogeneous intensity distributions. In this article, the authors present an advanced computerized method to semiautomatically segment tumor volumes on T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced breast MRI. The method starts with manual selection of a region of interest (ROI) that contains the lesion to be segmented in a single image, followed by automated separation of the lesion volume from its surrounding breast parenchyma by using a unique combination of the image processing techniques including Gaussian mixture modeling and a marker-controlled watershed transform. Explicitly, the Gaussian mixture modeling is applied to an intensity histogram of the pixels inside the ROI to distinguish the tumor class from other tissues. Based on the ROI and the intensity distribution of the tumor, internal and external markers are determined and the tumor contour is delineated using the marker-controlled watershed transform. To obtain the tumor volume, the segmented tumor in one slice is propagated to the adjacent slice to form an ROI in that slice. The marker-controlled watershed segmentation is then used again to obtain a tumor contour in the propagated slice. This procedure is terminated when there is no lesion in an adjacent slice. To reduce measurement variations possibly caused by the manual selection of the ROI, the segmentation result is refined based on an automatically determined ROI based on the segmented volume. The algorithm was applied to 13 patients with breast cancer, prospectively accrued prior to beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Each patient had two MRI scans, a baseline MRI examination prior to commencing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a 1 week follow-up after receiving the first dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Blinded to the computer segmentation results, two experienced radiologists manually delineated all tumors independently. The computer results were then compared with the manually generated results using the volume overlap ratio, defined as the intersection of the computer- and radiologist-generated tumor volumes divided by the union of the two. The algorithm reached overall overlap ratios of 62.6% +/- 9.1% and 61.0% +/- 11.3% in comparison to the two manual segmentation results, respectively. The overall overlap ratio between the two radiologists' manual segmentations was 64.3% +/- 10.4%. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed algorithm is a promising method for assisting in tumor volume measurement in contrast-enhanced breast MRI.</docText>

        <docText>Post-mastectomy radiotherapy.

Between 1997 and 1999, three studies re-ignited the debate on post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). Despite 20 years of follow-up and multiple re-analyses, the results of these studies still generate vigorous debate among the learned men and women who care for breast cancer patients. In honor of the 10th anniversary of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Post-Mastectomy trial 82c publication, the following review offers the reader a brief history of the controversies that preceded and followed these publications. Other related controversies, PMRT in the setting of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, positive margins or T3N0 primary tumors, as well as internal mammary lymph node irradiation, are also presented. Finally, we present a brief discussion about the toxicities associated with PMRT. This review will familiarize the reader with often discussed/debated issues concerning PMRT and prepare them to enter the debate.</docText>

        <docText>Airplane travel and lymphedema: a case study.

A single subject prospective study of the relationship between air travel and lymphedema is reported. This proof of concept study was aimed at assessing the feasibility of using self-measured, inter-limb impedance ratios as a quantitative measure of lymphedema immediately prior to and following flying. The participant, a breast cancer survivor with lymphedema, measured whole arm impedance prior to and following air travel on 20 occasions, varying in duration of between 1 and 9 h, over a 12-month period. Although the inter-arm impedance ratio fluctuated over this time, it generally increased and worsened following flying. Impedance measurements were easily performed by the participant and could be obtained as close to the start and cessation of flying as is practicably possible. These data, when associated with self-assessment of lymphedema-related symptoms, could provide a comprehensive evidence base for an assessment of the risks associated with air travel and the provision of appropriate advice to prospective travelers. Further large-scale studies are recommended.</docText>

        <docText>Breast cancer screening behaviors of African American women: a comprehensive review, analysis, and critique of nursing research.

Breast cancer is particularly burdensome on African American women (AAW) ranking second among the cause of cancer deaths in AAW. Although the incidence of breast cancer is highest in White women, AAW have a higher breast cancer mortality rate at every age and a lower survival rate than any other racial or ethnic group. Statistics indicate that the gap is widening. The results of several studies suggest that breast cancer mortality among AAW would be reduced if breast cancer screening recommendations were more effectively utilized. Results of research studies aimed at identifying variables relating to AAW acceptance of breast cancer screening activities have not had an impact on the disparity in mortality rates. The goals of this paper are to summarize the accumulated state of the nursing science and knowledge concerning breast cancer screening behavior of African American women, and to highlight important issues that research has left unresolved.</docText>

        <docText>Are HLA DQB1 alleles correlated with breast cancer histopronostic parameters in Tunisia?

BACKGROUND: Tumor cells express surface structures different from normal cells. These structures may be recognized by the immune system, which ensure anti-tumoral surveillance. Antigenic presentation requires HLA molecules role. Since, these molecules are encoded by a high polymorphic system, immune response can be modulated according to HLA genotype. So, HLA polymorphism could be correlated with tumor escape from anti-tumor immunosurveillance. AIM: We have aimed to search for possible associations between HLA DQB1 alleles and the histoprognostical parameters in breast cancer in the Tunisian population. METHODS: DQB1 alleles were determined by PCR-SSO molecular typing in 100 healthy matched and unrelated Tunisian female and 87 Tunisian women with breast cancer. RESULTS: Allelic distribution between the two studied groups showed no significant associations between this locus and the occurrence, the EE grade and the lymph node invasion of breast cancer in the Tunisian population. CONCLUSION: This result may be explained by the fact that cancer is a multifactoral disease due to several interacting factors that might change from one population to another.</docText>

        <docText>Internal mammary lymph node invasion in breast cancer: myth or reality?

The internal mammary nodes are often underestimated as breast cancer lymphatic pathway spread. It is yet the first site of lymphatic invasion in central or internal tumors and the second site in external tumors. The intra-thoracic situation of internal mammary nodes explains partly, the difficulty of its exploration. To evaluate the risk of internal mammary node invasion, some predictive factors are established (tumor size, internal or central tumor location, axillary node invasion and young age). Prognostic and therapeutic impact of invasion justifies its systematic research. Without exploring internal mammary nodes status, TNM classification remains, incomplete. CT scanner, magnetic resonnance imaging, positron emission tomography scanner and sentinel node exploration technique are helpful to explore this region and to adapt its irradiation.</docText>

        <docText>Initial surgical experience evaluating early tolerance and toxicities in patients undergoing accelerated partial breast irradiation using the Contura Multi Lumen Balloon breast brachytherapy catheter.

We reviewed our surgical experience with the Contura Multi Lumen Balloon breast brachytherapy catheter used to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation and determined short-term treatment efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity. Forty-six patients undergoing breast conserving therapy, including the use of Contura catheter, were analyzed. Thirty-four Gray were delivered in 10 fractions. Fourteen patients had stage 0, 24 had stage I, and 8 had stage II breast cancer. Catheters were placed with a closed cavity technique. Median minimum skin spacing was 10 mm (range, 2-18 mm). Median maximum skin doses were 99.7 per cent of the prescription dose. Nine patients were treated with a skin spacing &lt; or = 5 mm (2 patients with 2 mm skin spacing). The percentage of patients with excellent/good cosmesis at 6 (n = 26) and 12 (n = 13) months was 100 per cent, respectively. Patient tolerance was assessed on a scale of 0-10 (0 = no pain, 10 = requiring narcotic analgesics). Pain was graded &lt; or = 3 in 98 per cent of patients at catheter insertion and 84 per cent at catheter removal. Four breast infections (8.8%) and one symptomatic seroma developed. Adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation using the Contura Multi Lumen Balloon exhibited similar toxicities to standard single lumen, single dwell balloon brachytherapy with improvements in dosimetric capabilities allowing the treatment of patients with skin spacing &lt; or = 5 mm.</docText>

        <docText>Overlooking evidence: media ignore environmental connections to breast cancer.

In this article, the author reviews seven years' worth of major news media coverage of the role of environmental pollutants in the etiology of breast cancer. The time frame was 2002-2008 and the outlets studied included prominent newspapers, national news magazines, and network television news programs. Noting that a growing body of private, university, and government environmental health research has implicated a variety of common chemicals and radiation in the disease, the author looked for quantity and quality of coverage of two scientific metastudies during the specified time frame: State of the Evidence: The Connection Between Breast Cancer and the Environment and Environmental Pollutants and Breast Cancer: Epidemiological Studies. She also examined reporting on breast cancer in the month of October ("National Breast Cancer Awareness Month") during the seven years. Despite recent scientific findings, the news media have downplayed and frequently overlooked the evidence. None of the outlets studied covered the State of the Evidence report, and only one covered the Environmental Pollutants report. Breast Cancer Awareness Month similarly saw few articles or newscasts about environmental connections. The author attributes the dearth of coverage to several factors: journalists' lack of awareness about environmental health science, the seemingly higher standards of proof for research findings that implicate chemicals in disease than for other types of scientific research, establishments' lack of acceptance of environmental theories of breast cancer, and economic pressures on news outlets not to alienate their advertisers.</docText>

        <docText>AdaBoost-based multiple SVM-RFE for classification of mammograms in DDSM.

BACKGROUND: Digital mammography is one of the most promising options to diagnose breast cancer which is the most common cancer in women. However, its effectiveness is enfeebled due to the difficulty in distinguishing actual cancer lesions from benign abnormalities, which results in unnecessary biopsy referrals. To overcome this issue, computer aided diagnosis (CADx) using machine learning techniques have been studied worldwide. Since this is a classification problem and the number of features obtainable from a mammogram image is infinite, a feature selection method that is tailored for use in the CADx systems is needed. METHODS: We propose a feature selection method based on multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination (MSVM-RFE). We compared our method with four previously proposed feature selection methods which use support vector machine as the base classifier. Experiments were performed on lesions extracted from the Digital Database of Screening Mammography, the largest public digital mammography database available. We measured average accuracy over 5-fold cross validation on the 8 datasets we extracted. RESULTS: Selecting from 8 features, conventional algorithms like SVM-RFE and multiple SVM-RFE showed slightly better performance than others. However, when selecting from 22 features, our proposed modified multiple SVM-RFE using boosting outperformed or was at least competitive to all others. CONCLUSION: Our modified method may be a possible alternative to SVM-RFE or the original MSVM-RFE in many cases of interest. In the future, we need a specific method to effectively combine models trained during the feature selection process and a way to combine feature subsets generated from individual SVM-RFE instances.</docText>

        <docText>Linking exposure assessment science with policy objectives for environmental justice and breast cancer advocacy: the northern California household exposure study.

OBJECTIVES: We compared an urban fence-line community (neighboring an oil refinery) and a nonindustrial community in an exposure study focusing on pollutants of interest with respect to breast cancer and environmental justice. METHODS: We analyzed indoor and outdoor air from 40 homes in industrial Richmond, California, and 10 in rural Bolinas, California, for 153 compounds, including particulates and endocrine disruptors. RESULTS: Eighty compounds were detected outdoors in Richmond and 60 in Bolinas; Richmond concentrations were generally higher. Richmond's vanadium and nickel levels indicated effects of heavy oil combustion from oil refining and shipping; these levels were among the state's highest. In nearly half of Richmond homes, PM(2.5) exceeded California's annual ambient air quality standard. Paired outdoor-indoor measurements were significantly correlated for industry- and traffic-related PM(2.5), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, elemental carbon, metals, and sulfates (r = 0.54-0.92, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Indoor air quality is an important indicator of the cumulative impact of outdoor emissions in fence-line communities. Policies based on outdoor monitoring alone add to environmental injustice concerns in communities that host polluters. Community-based participatory exposure research can contribute to science and stimulate and inform action on the part of community residents and policymakers.</docText>

        <docText>The politics of plastics: the making and unmaking of bisphenol a "safety".

Bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic chemical used in the production of plastics since the 1950s and a known endocrine disruptor, is a ubiquitous component of the material environment and human body. New research on very-low-dose exposure to BPA suggests an association with adverse health effects, including breast and prostate cancer, obesity, neurobehavioral problems, and reproductive abnormalities. These findings challenge the long-standing scientific and legal presumption of BPA's safety. The history of how BPA's safety was defined and defended provides critical insight into the questions now facing lawmakers and regulators: is BPA safe, and if not, what steps must be taken to protect the public's health? Answers to both questions involve reforms in chemical policy, with implications beyond BPA.</docText>

        <docText>De novo malignancies following liver transplantation: impact and recommendations.

1. De novo malignancy is one of the leading causes of late mortality after liver transplantation. 2. The risks of skin cancers and lymphoma are more than 10-fold greater than the risks in an age-matched and sex-matched general population. 3. Some types of neoplasia, such as lung, head and neck, and colorectal cancer, are more frequent in liver transplant recipients than in an age-matched and sex-matched population. The risks of other frequent malignancies, such as prostate and breast cancer, do not seem to be increased. 4. The most important risks for posttransplant malignancy are Epstein-Barr virus seronegativity (for lymphoma), sun exposure (for skin cancer), smoking, and increasing age. 5. Despite the absence of evidence, general recommendations (such as avoidance of overimmunosuppression, sunlight protection, and cessation of smoking) should be given. Screening protocols may help to detect neoplasia at an early stage of disease.</docText>

        <docText>CXCL12 rs1801157 polymorphism in patients with breast cancer, hodgkin's lymphoma, and non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

Chemokines and their receptors regulate the trafficking of immune cells during their development, inflammation, and tissue repair. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1801157 (previously known as CXCL12-A/ stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1)-3'A) in CXCL12/SDF1 gene was assessed in breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), since the chemokine CXCL12, previously known as SDF1, and its receptor CXCR4 regulate leukocyte trafficking and many essential biological processes, including tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis of different types of tumors. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism) using a restriction enzyme HpaII cleavage. No significant difference was observed in genotype distribution between breast cancer patients (GG: 57.3%; GA: 39.8%; AA: 2.9%) and healthy female controls (GG: 62.9%; GA: 33%; AA: 4.1%) nor between HL patients (GG: 61.1%; GA:27.8%; AA: 11.1%) and healthy controls (GG: 65.6%; GA: 28.9%; AA: 5.5%), whereas a significant difference was observed in genotype distribution between NHL patients (GG: 51.4%; GA: 47.1%; AA: 1.5%) and healthy controls (GG: 65.6%; GA: 28.9%; AA: 5.5%). Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the cancer chemokine network. However, this study suggests that CXCL12 rs1801157 polymorphism may have important implications in the pathogenesis of NHL. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 23:387-393, 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</docText>

        <docText>A tissue reconstitution model to study cancer cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors in mammary tumourigenesis.

The contribution of cancer cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors to metastatic breast cancer is still poorly understood, hampering development of novel therapeutic strategies that decrease breast cancer mortality. Cre/loxP-based conditional mouse models of breast cancer present unique opportunities to study sporadic tumour formation and progression in a controlled setting. Unfortunately, the generation of mouse strains carrying multiple mutant alleles needed for such studies is very time-consuming. Moreover, conditional mouse tumour models do not permit independent manipulation of tumour cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors. Although the latter can be achieved by cleared fat-pad transplantation of mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs) from tumour suppressor gene (TSG) knockouts into wild-type or mutant recipients, this procedure is not possible for mutations that cause embryonic lethality or preclude mammary gland development. Here we show that cleared fat-pad transplantations with MMECs isolated from K14cre;Cdh1(F/F); Trp53(F/F) mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the cytokeratin-14 promoter and carrying conditional null alleles for p53 and E-cadherin (Cdh1) first resulted in the formation of phenotypically normal mammary glands, followed by the development of invasive metastatic mammary tumours. Tumour formation in the recipients mimicked tumour latency, spectrum, morphology, immunophenotype, and metastatic characteristics of the original mammary tumour model. This transplantation system, which can be expanded to other conditional TSG knockouts, permits independent genetic analysis of stromal factors and testing of additional cancer cell-intrinsic mutations that would otherwise be embryonic lethal or require intensive breeding.

        <docText>Synthesis and Antiproliferative Activitiy of Novel Diaryl Ureas Possessing a 4H-Pyrido1,2-apyrimidin-4-one Group.

We herein disclose a series of novel diaryl urea derivatives possessing a 4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one group as novel potent anticancer compounds. The structures were confirmed by IR,( 1)H-NMR, and MS. All the compounds were screened for their antiprofilerative activity agaist the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). The pharmacological results indicated that most of the compounds showed moderate activity. The best of this series is compound 4c (IC(50 )= 0.7 mumol/L), with a potency 3.6-fold higher than Sorafenib (IC(50) = 2.5 mumol/L), which was approved in 2005.</docText>

        <docText>The contribution of gene expression profiling to breast cancer classification, prognostication and prediction: a retrospective of the last decade.

In the last decade, the development of microarrays and the ability to perform massively parallel gene expression analysis of human tumours were received with great excitement by the scientific community. The promise of microarrays was of apocalyptic dimensions, with some experts envisaging that it would be a matter of a few years for this technology to replace traditional clinicopathological markers in clinical practice and treatment decision-making. The replacement of histopathology by high-tech and more objective approaches to cancer diagnosis, prognostication and prediction was, at that time, a foregone conclusion. Ten years after the initial publications of translational research studies using microarrays, one cannot deny that this technology has changed the way breast cancer is perceived. It has brought the concept of breast cancer heterogeneity to the forefront of cancer research, and the fact that distinct subtypes of breast cancer are completely different diseases that affect the same anatomical site. Furthermore, it has led to the development of prognostic and predictive 'gene signatures', which are yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice. Importantly, though, the prognostic and predictive power of microarrays has been shown to be complementary to, rather than a replacement for, traditional clinicopathological parameters. Here we endeavour to provide a fair and balanced assessment of what microarray-based gene expression analysis has taught us in the last decade and its contribution to breast cancer classification, prognostication and prediction.

        <docText>Catumaxomab: A bispecific trifunctional antibody.

The trifunctional bispecific monoclonal antibody catumaxomab has two binding specificities directed at epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the T-cell antigen CD3. With its Fc-fragment, catumaxomab additionally binds accessory cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. The trifunctional approach thus leads to unrestricted but specific killing of epithelial tumor cells by major histocompatibility complex without the need for preactivation or external costimulation. The tumor-associated antigen EpCAM is strongly expressed in carcinomas of various origins including colon, rectum, ovarian, gastric, esophagus, lung, pancreas, breast and head and neck. Expression of EpCAM is often associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Catumaxomab has been approved in Europe for the intraperitoneal treatment of malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive epithelial tumors when standard therapy is not available or is no longer feasible. Basic preclinical and clinical findings with different routes of catumaxomab administration in various indications are summarized and discussed in this review.</docText>

        <docText>The relation of leptin and adiponectin with breast density among premenopausal women.

The adipocytokine leptin may increase breast cancer risk, while adiponectin may be protective. We examined the association of the two circulating markers with mammographic density, a strong predictor of breast cancer risk. For 183 premenopausal participants of a nutritional trial, mammograms performed at baseline, year 1 and year 2 were assessed for density using a computer-assisted method. Serum samples obtained at the same time were analyzed for leptin and adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We applied mixed models to incorporate the repeated measurements while adjusting for confounders including body mass index (BMI). At baseline, the mean age of the participants was 42.6+/-2.9 years; 40% were of Asian ancestry. Leptin was lower and adiponectin higher in normal weight than overweight women. Neither marker was related to absolute breast density. The significant inverse association of leptin with percent density disappeared when BMI was added to the model. After stratification by weight, percent density decreased with higher leptin levels in normal weight women, whereas it increased among overweight participants. After adjustment for BMI, the positive association between percent density and adiponectin was greatly reduced and no longer significant. These results do not support a strong association of leptin or adiponectin with breast cancer risk as assessed by mammographic density. In contrast, the findings suggest the possibility that the inverse association of BMI with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women is mediated by adipocytokines.</docText>

        <docText>Feasibility of Using Risk Factors to Screen for Psychological Disorder During Routine Breast Care Nurse Consultations.

This study investigated using risk factors to psychosocial problems to screen for psychological disorders among 100 women with early-stage breast cancer. The National Health and Medical Research Council produced psychosocial clinical practice guidelines for health professionals working with women with breast cancer. They identified risk factors to psychosocial problems in breast cancer. The Breast Cancer-Vulnerability Index (BC-VI), which we developed, is composed of these empirically derived risk factors. This study investigated whether the breast care nurse-administered BC-VI correctly identifies women who had mood and/or anxiety disorders, in comparison with a psychiatric interview. We recruited 100 women with early-stage breast cancer after surgery and before adjuvant treatment. They completed questionnaires and were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The breast care nurses rated women on the BC-VI using information gathered during clinical consultations. Results indicated that the BC-VI was correlated with diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders. However, cutoff scores for the BC-VI were not sufficiently sensitive or specific to use to identify those with clinical disorders. However, this was also the case for the included screening questionnaires. This article discusses the implications of these results and offers suggestions for future research.</docText>

        <docText>Why Some Women Have an Optimistic or a Pessimistic Bias About Their Breast Cancer Risk: Experiences, Heuristics, and Knowledge of Risk Factors.

Perceived risk to a health problem is formed by inferential rules called heuristics and by comparative judgments that assess how one's risk compares to the risk of others. The purpose of this cross-sectional, community-based survey was to examine how experiences with breast cancer, knowledge of risk factors, and specific heuristics inform risk judgments for oneself, for friends/peers, and comparative judgments for breast cancer (risk friends/peers - risk self). We recruited an English-speaking, multicultural (57% nonwhite) sample of 184 middle-aged (47 +/- 12 years old), well-educated women. Fifty percent of participants perceived that their breast cancer risk was the same as the risk of their friends/peers; 10% were pessimistic (risk friends/peers - risk self &lt; 0), whereas 40% were optimistic (risk friends/peers - risk self &gt; 0). Family history of breast cancer and worry informed risk judgments for oneself. The availability and cultural heuristics specific for black women informed risk judgments for friends/peers. Knowledge of risk factors and interactions of knowledge with the availability, representativeness, and simulation heuristics informed comparative judgments (risk friends/peers - risk self). We discuss cognitive mechanisms with which experiences, knowledge, and heuristics influence comparative breast cancer risk judgments. Risk communication interventions should assess knowledge deficits, contextual variables, and specific heuristics that activate differential information processing mechanisms.</docText>

        <docText>Activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling by osteopontin promotes tumor growth in human breast cancer cells.

Deregulation of STAT3 signaling plays crucial role in oncogenesis of various cancers. However, the molecular mechanism by which osteopontin (OPN), a chemokine like ECM associated protein regulates STAT3 activation which leads to tumor progression and inhibits apoptosis in breast cancer cells is not well understood. In this study, we for the first time report that OPN upregulates alphavbeta3 integrin-mediated JAK2 phosphorylation and STAT3 activation in breast cancer (MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7) cells. Pretreatment of cells with JAK2 inhibitor (AG 490) suppresses OPN-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, its nuclear localization and DNA-binding indicating that JAK2 is involved in this process. Transfection of cells with wild type STAT3 (wt STAT3) enhanced whereas mutant STAT3 (STAT3 Y705F) suppressed OPN-induced breast tumor cell migration. Treatment of cells with OPN followed by staurosporine showed that OPN protects the cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, transfection of cells with wt STAT3 upregulates whereas STAT3 Y705F downregulates Bcl2 and cyclin D1 expressions in response to OPN. Interestingly, STAT3 overexpressing cells when injected to NOD/SCID mice followed by OPN treatment, the mice developed enhanced tumor growth as compared to STAT3 Y705F injected mice or mice injected with OPN alone. The levels of Bcl2 and cyclin D1 in wt STAT3 tumors were significantly higher than controls. Clinical specimen analysis revealed that increased OPN and pSTAT3 expressions correlate with enhanced breast tumor progression. Thus, targeting OPN and its regulated STAT3 signaling could be a potent therapeutic approach and understanding these mechanisms may form the basis of new therapeutic regimen for the management of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Circadian Clock Manipulation for Cancer Prevention and Control and the Relief of Cancer Symptoms.</docTitle>
        <docText>Circadian Clock Manipulation for Cancer Prevention and Control and the Relief of Cancer Symptoms.

Life has evolved on this planet with regular daily spans of direct solar energy availability alternating with nocturnal spans of dark. Virtually every earth-borne life form has factored this circadian pattern into its biology to ensure the temporal coordination with its resonating environment, a task essential for its individual survival and that of its species. The first whole genome inspections of mutations in human colon and breast cancer have observed specific retained clock gene mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms within the genes of clock, clock-controlled, and melatonin pathways have been found to confer excess cancer risk or protection from cancer. Experimental studies have shown that specific core clock genes (Per2 and Per1) are tumor suppressors because their genetic absence doubles tumor numbers, and decreasing their expression in cancer cells doubles cancer growth rate, whereas their overexpression decreases cancer growth rate and diminishes tumor numbers. Experimental interference with circadian clock function increases cancer growth rate, and clinical circadian disruption is associated with higher cancer incidence, faster cancer progression, and shorter cancer patient survival. Patients with advanced lung cancer suffering greater circadian activity/sleep cycle disruption suffer greater interference with function, greater anxiety and depression, poorer nighttime sleep, greater daytime fatigue, and poorer quality of life than comparable patients who maintain good circadian integration. We must now determine whether strategies known to help synchronize the circadian clocks of normal individuals can do so in advanced cancer patients and whether doing so allows cancer patients to feel better and/or live longer. Several academic laboratories and at least 2 large pharmaceutical firms are screening for small molecules targeting the circadian clock to stabilize its phase and enhance its amplitude and thereby consolidate and coordinate circadian organization, which in turn is likely to help prevent and control human cancer. These drugs and strategies can, in turn, be used to make cancer patients with advanced disease feel and function more normally.</docText>

        <docText>Tissue microarray for routine analysis of breast biomarkers in the clinical laboratory.

Tissue microarray analysis (TMA) allows multiple analyses on multiple patients on sections from a single paraffin block. Although it is widely used in research and in quality assurance settings, there are few references to its use in clinical practice. This study evaluated TMA assessment of breast biomarkers using immunohistochemical analysis in a clinical histopathology laboratory. Performance parameters, interobserver variability, and concordance between TMA and whole section results were assessed. The arrays had few lost or noninformative cores. A loss of stain intensity occurred in the arrays compared with the whole sections with some but not all antibodies, highlighting the need to validate the staining protocol for each antibody used on TMA sections. With recommended guidelines for specimen selection and reporting, TMA was found to be an economical replacement for whole section analysis for breast biomarkers.</docText>

        <docText>Clonal relationship between closely approximated low-grade ductal and lobular lesions in the breast: a molecular study of 10 cases.

The relationship between ductal and lobular breast carcinoma is highlighted in cases in which these morphologically divergent carcinomas coexist in proximity within a single patient. We hypothesized that such cases may result from the proliferation of a precursor lesion into a tumor containing areas of divergent morphologic features. In this study, we analyzed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 10 cases of coexistent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and invasive carcinoma. DNA from the separate components of each lesion was subjected to LOH analysis using 13 markers on 7 chromosomes. In 7 cases, the DCIS and LCIS shared loss of a common allele, suggesting a clonal relationship. The invasive component shared loss of the same allele in 5 tumors. This finding indicates that coexistent lobular and ductal carcinomas exhibit shared genetic abnormalities, contradicting the conventional concept that these lesions represent separate, exclusive pathways of breast neoplasia. Instead, these traditionally segregated classes of breast cancer may, in fact, share common precursor lesions.</docText>

        <docText>Purinergic mechanisms in breast cancer support intravasation, extravasation and angiogenesis.

Several advances have recently expanded models of tumor growth and promoted the concept of tumor homeostasis, the hypothesis that primary tumors exert an anti-proliferative effect on both themselves and subclinical secondary metastases. Recent trials indicate that the characterization of tumor growth as uncontrolled is inconsistent with animal models, clinical models, and epidemiological models. There is a growing body of evidence which lends support to an updated concept of tumor growth: tumor homeostasis. In the case of breast cancer, if not all metastasizing tumors, these advances suggest an inconvenient truth. That is, if breast tumor cells metastasize to distant sites early in the tumorigenesis process, then removal of a breast tumor may hasten the development of its metastases. We explore the heretofore unappreciated notion that nucleotides generated by tumor cells following the secretion of an ADP-kinase can promote metastasis and support angiogenesis. Evidence is presented that blockade of the actions of nucleotides in the setting of newly diagnosed breast cancer may provide a useful adjunct to current anti-angiogenesis treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Id1, inhibitor of differentiation, is a key protein mediating anti-tumor responses of gamma-tocotrienol in breast cancer cells.

Gamma-tocotrienol has demonstrated anti-proliferative effect on breast cancer (BCa) cells, but mechanisms involved are largely unknown. This study aimed at deciphering the molecular pathways responsible for its activity. Our results showed that treatment of BCa cells with gamma-tocotrienol resulted in induction of apoptosis as evidenced by activation of pro-caspases, accumulation of sub-G1 cells and DNA fragmentations. Examination of the pro-survival genes revealed that the gamma-tocotrienol-induced cell death was associated with suppression of Id1 and NF-kappaB through modulation of their upstream regulators (Src, Smad1/5/8, Fak and LOX). Meanwhile, gamma-tocotrienol treatment also resulted in the induction of JNK signaling pathway and inhibition of JNK activity by specific inhibitor partially blocked the effect of gamma-tocotrienol. Furthermore, synergistic effect was observed when cells were co-treated with gamma-tocotrienol and Docetaxel. Interestingly, in cells that treated with gamma-tocotrienol, alpha-tocopherol or beta-aminoproprionitrile were found to partially restore Id1 expression. Meanwhile, this restoration of Id1 was found to protect the cells from gamma-tocotrienol induced apoptosis. Consistent outcome was observed in cells ectopically transfected with the Id-1 gene. Our results suggested that the anti-proliferative and chemosensitization effect of gamma-tocotrienol on BCa cells may be mediated through downregulation of Id1 protein.</docText>

        <docText>Induction of G1 cell cycle arrest and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells by selenium-enriched Spirulina extract.

Both selenium (Se) and Spirulina have been demonstrated to show anticancer potential. In the present study, we showed that Se-enriched Spirulina platensis extract (Se-SE) inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through induction of G1 cell cycle arrest and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Se-SE-induced G1-phase arrest was associated with a decrease in expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CKD6, and an increase in protein levels of p15 INK4B, p21 Waf1/Cip1 and p53. Induction of apoptosis by Se-SE was evidenced by accumulation of sub-G1 cell population, DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation. This apoptotic process was accompanied by the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 and PARP cleavage. Moreover, Se-SE-induced mitochondrial dysfunction through up-regulation of Bax and Bad expression and down-regulation of Bcl-xl expression. Our results suggest the potential applications of Se-SE in chemoprevention of human breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Magnetic resonance imaging of breast vascularity in medial versus lateral breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Breasts with malignant tumors can demonstrate a general increased vascularity compared to the contralateral breast and a prominent blood vessel adjacent to the tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the study was to further characterize these alterations in blood supply by location of the tumor within the breast using MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 105 patients who underwent breast MRI for suspicion of a malignancy over a 2-year period. Fifty-one had pathologically verified malignant tumors (study group), 11 had pathologically verified benign lesions (control), and 43 had negative scans (control). The malignant lesions were distinguished by location, medial or lateral, within the breast. Origin of the vascular supply and vessel diameter was recorded in a blinded manner. When available, MRI scans performed 2 years after treatment were reviewed as well. RESULTS: Of the 24 medial malignant tumors, 21 (87%) had a predominantly medial vascular supply and 3 (13%), a predominantly lateral supply; of the 23 lateral tumors, 11 (48%) had a predominantly medial vascular supply and 8 (35%), a predominantly lateral supply (p=0.03). In 4 cases, no dominant vessel was noted. Maximum vessel diameter was 3.6+/-1.1mm in the patients with malignancy and 2.6+/-0.8mm in the controls (p&lt;0.0005). General increased vascularity was demonstrated in 91% of the medial tumor subgroup and 83% of the lateral tumor subgroup, as opposed to 36-37% in the control groups (p&lt;0.0005). Follow-up MRI, performed in 8 patients in the malignant-tumor group after treatment, revealed a considerable decrease in the prominent vessels, to a size close to that of the controls. CONCLUSION: Breasts with malignant tumors are characterized by an altered general vascular supply, a prominent feeding vessel, and increased regional vascularity. Both the presence and location of the tumor affect the vascular supply. The vascular change apparently diminishes after treatment, although this finding requires further investigation in a larger sample.</docText>

Condensation of 9-chloro-2,4-(un)substituted acridines (1a-c) with various amines (2a-e) and 9-isothiocyanato-2,4-(un)substituted acridines (4a,b) with different amines (2a,b,d,e) gave condensed products 3a-o and 5a-g respectively. Compounds 3a-o and 5a-g were screened for anti-inflammatory activity at a dose of 50mg/kg p.o. Compound 3e exhibited 41.17% anti-inflammatory activity which is better than most commonly used standard drug ibuprofen which showed 39% anti-inflammatory (at 50mg/kg p.o.) activity. Anticancer activity evaluation of compounds 3a-o and 5a-g was carried out against a small panel of human cancer cell lines and compounds 3g, 3m and 5g exhibited good anticancer activity against breast (MCF-7), liver (HEP-2), colon (COLO-205, 502713, HCT-15), lung (A-549) and neuroblastoma (IMR-32) cancer cell lines at a concentration of 1x10(-5)M.</docText>

        <docText>Diagnosis and staging of primary ovarian cancer: Correlation between PET/CT, Doppler US, and CT or MRI.

PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), pelvic Doppler ultrasonography (US), abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT), and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of ovarian cancer and to assess the role of PET/CT in evaluating the dissemination of ovarian cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-three women suspected to have ovarian cancer were enrolled in a prospective study before surgery between March 2005 and August 2007. The accuracy of each modality in detection of malignancy was estimated by computing the relevant areas under a receiver operating characteristics curve. Histopathologic results served as the reference standard. RESULTS: Histopathology showed benign tumors in 25 patients, borderline tumors in 13 patients, and malignant tumors in 95 patients. In distinguishing malignant/borderline from benign ovarian tumors, the accuracy of PET/CT (0.921) was higher than that of pelvis US (0.830) and abdomino-pelvic CT or pelvis MRI (0.749; P=0.013). Radiologic staging by PET/CT was concordant with surgical staging in 78% of patient and PET/CT revealed 15 (15.8%) unpredicted extra-abdominal lymph node metastasis in 95 patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, PET/CT detected new, unexpected co-existing malignant tumors in five (3.8%) cases including two thyroid tumors, two breast tumors, and one pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer. CONCLUSION: PET/CT is superior to pelvis US, abdomino-pelvic CT, and pelvic MRI for diagnosis of malignant ovarian tumors and is useful in revealing metastatic ovarian cancer and co-existing malignant tumors. Therefore, we suggest that PET/CT could be used during pre-operative evaluation of patients suspected to have ovarian cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Directional control of WAVE2 membrane targeting by EB1 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate.

Membrane targeting of WAVE2 along microtubules is mediated by a motor protein kinesin and requires Pak1, a downstream effector of Rac1. However, the mechanism by which WAVE2 targeting to the leading edge is directionally controlled remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that EB1, a microtubule plus-end-binding protein, constitutively associates with stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein, in human breast cancer cells. Stimulation of the cells with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induced Pak1-dependent binding of the EB1-stathmin complex to microtubules that bear WAVE2 and colocalization of the complex with WAVE2 at the leading edge. Depletion of EB1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the IGF-I-induced WAVE2 targeting and stathmin binding to microtubules. On the other hand, chemotaxis chamber assays indicated that the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) was locally activated in the region facing toward IGF-I. In addition, IGF-I caused phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-dependent production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) near activated IGF-IR and WAVE2 colocalization with it. Collectively, WAVE2-membrane targeting is directionally controlled by binding of the EB1-stathmin complex to WAVE2-bearing microtubules and by the interaction between WAVE2 and PIP(3) produced near IGF-IR that is locally activated by IGF-I.</docText>

        <docText>mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK/RSK signaling pathways coordinately regulate estrogen receptor alpha serine 167 phosphorylation.

Resistance to anti-estrogen therapy is a major clinical concern in treatment of breast cancer. Estrogen-independent phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha, specifically on Ser167, is one of the contributing causes to development of resistance, and a prognostic marker for the disease. Here, we dissect the signaling pathways responsible for Ser167 phosphorylation. We report that the mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK/RSK contribute non-overlapping inputs into ERalpha activation via Ser167 phosphorylation. This cooperation may be targeted in breast cancer treatment by a combination of mTOR and MAPK inhibitors.</docText>

        <docText>Ligand-specific sequential regulation of transcription factors for differentiation of MCF-7 cells.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Sharing a common ErbB/HER receptor signaling pathway, heregulin (HRG) induces differentiation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells while epidermal growth factor (EGF) elicits proliferation. Although cell fates resulting from action of the aforementioned ligands completely different, the respective gene expression profiles in early transcription are qualitatively similar, suggesting that gene expression during late transcription, but not early transcription, may reflect ligand specificity. In this study, based on both the data from time-course quantitative real-time PCR on over 2,000 human transcription factors and microarray of all human genes, we identified a series of transcription factors which may control HRG-specific late transcription in MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: We predicted that four transcription factors including EGR4, FRA-1, FHL2, and DIPA should have responsibility of regulation in MCF-7 cell differentiation. Validation analysis suggested that one member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family, FOSL-1 (FRA-1 gene), appeared immediately following c-FOS expression, might be responsible for expression of transcription factor FHL2 through activation of the AP-1 complex. Furthermore, RNAi gene silencing of FOSL-1 and FHL2 resulted in increase of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation of which duration was sustained by HRG stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicated that a time-dependent transcriptional regulatory network including c-FOS, FRA-1, and FHL2 is vital in controlling the ERK signaling pathway through a negative feedback loop for MCF-7 cell differentiation.</docText>

        <docText>Anti-angiogenic cancer therapy updates.

Anti-angiogenic therapy has fundamentally landmarked the clinical new era of anti-cancer therapy. It was demonstrated that the blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor results in regression of the disease and prolongation of survival. In contrast, it was clarified that the differential sensitivity of the therapeutic impact exists. Many thought-provoking questions have been raised in this field. Herein, we focus on the clinical data and attempt to summarize some clinical trials of anti-angiogenic treatment, highlighting the sparkling articles, the differential sensitivities to these agents beyond progression continuation, and how to individualize treatment according to validated biomarkers.</docText>

        <docText>Hemangiomas, angiosarcomas, and vascular malformations represent the signaling abnormalities of pathogenic angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis is a major factor in the development of benign, inflammatory, and malignant processes of the skin. Endothelial cells are the effector cells of angiogenesis, and understanding their response to growth factors and inhibitors is critical to understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of skin disease. Hemangiomas, benign tumors of endothelial cells, represent the most common tumor of childhood. In our previous studies, we have found that tumor vasculature in human solid tumors expresses similarities in signaling to that of hemangiomas, making the knowledge of signaling in hemangiomas widely applicable. These similarities include expression of reactive oxygen, NFkB and akt in tumor vasculature. Furthermore, we have studied malignant vascular tumors, including hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma and have shown distinct signaling abnormalities in these tumors. The incidence of these tumors is expected to rise due to environmental insults, such as radiation and lumpectomy for breast cancer, dietary and industrial carcinogens (hepatic angiosarcoma), and chronic ultraviolet exposure and potential Agent Orange exposure. I hypothesize that hemangiomas, angiosarcomas, and vascular malformations represent the extremes of signaling abnormalities seen in pathogenic angiogenesis.</docText>

        <docTitle>Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.</docTitle>
        <docText>Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.

We present up to 45 years of cancer incidence data by occupational category for the Nordic populations. The study covers the 15 million people aged 30-64 years in the 1960, 1970, 1980/1981 and/or 1990 censuses in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and the 2.8 million incident cancer cases diagnosed in these people in a follow-up until about 2005. The study was undertaken as a cohort study with linkage of individual records based on the personal identity codes used in all the Nordic countries. In the censuses, information on occupation for each person was provided through free text in self-administered questionnaires. The data were centrally coded and computerised in the statistical offices. For the present study, the original occupational codes were reclassified into 53 occupational categories and one group of economically inactive persons. All Nordic countries have a nation-wide registration of incident cancer cases during the entire study period. For the present study the incident cancer cases were classified into 49 primary diagnostic categories. Some categories have been further divided according to sub-site or morphological type. The observed number of cancer cases in each group of persons defined by country, sex, age, period and occupation was compared with the expected number calculated from the stratum specific person years and the incidence rates for the national population. The result was presented as a standardised incidence ratio, SIR, defined as the observed number of cases divided by the expected number. For all cancers combined (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), the study showed a wide variation among men from an SIR of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.95) in domestic assistants to 1.48 (1.43-1.54) in waiters. The occupations with the highest SIRs also included workers producing beverage and tobacco, seamen and chimney sweeps. Among women, the SIRs varied from 0.58 (0.37-0.87) in seafarers to 1.27 (1.19-1.35) in tobacco workers. Low SIRs were found for farmers, gardeners and teachers. Our study was able to repeat most of the confirmed associations between occupations and cancers. It is known that almost all mesotheliomas are associated with asbestos exposure. Accordingly, plumbers, seamen and mechanics were the occupations with the highest risk in the present study. Mesothelioma was the cancer type showing the largest relative differences between the occupations. Outdoor workers such as fishermen, gardeners and farmers had the highest risk of lip cancer, while the lowest risk was found among indoor workers such as physicians and artistic workers. Studies of nasal cancer have shown increased risks associated with exposure to wood dust, both for those in furniture making and for those exposed exclusively to soft wood like the majority of Nordic woodworkers. We observed an SIR of 1.84 (1.66-2.04) in male and 1.88 (0.90-3.46) in female woodworkers. For nasal adenocarcinoma, the SIR in males was as high as 5.50 (4.60-6.56). Male waiters and tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer, probably attributable to active and passive smoking. Miners and quarry workers also had a high risk, which might be related to their exposure to silica dust and radon daughters. Among women, tobacco workers and engine operators had a more than fourfold risk as compared with the lung cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and teachers. The occupational risk patterns were quite similar in all main histological subtypes of lung cancer. Bladder cancer is considered as one of the cancer types most likely to be related to occupational carcinogens. Waiters had the highest risk of bladder cancer in men and tobacco workers in women, and the low-risk categories were the same ones as for lung cancer. All this can be accounted for by smoking. The second-highest SIRs were among chimney sweeps and hairdressers. Chimney sweeps are exposed to carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the chimney soot, and hairdressers' work environment is also rich in chemical agents. Exposure to the known hepatocarcinogens, the Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin, is rare in the Nordic countries, and a large proportion of primary liver cancers can therefore be attributed to alcohol consumption. The highest risks of liver cancer were seen in occupational categories with easy access to alcohol at the work place or with cultural traditions of high alcohol consumption, such as waiters, cooks, beverage workers, journalists and seamen. The risk of colon cancer has been related to sedentary work. The findings in the present study did not strongly indicate any protective role of physical activity. Colon cancer was one of the cancer types showing the smallest relative variation in incidence between occupational categories. The occupational variation in the risk of female breast cancer (the most common cancer type in the present series, 373 361 cases) was larger, and there was a tendency of physically demanding occupations to show SIRs below unity. Women in occupations which require a high level of education have, on average, a higher age at first child-birth and elevated breast cancer incidence. Women in occupational categories with the highest average number of children had markedly lower incidence. In male breast cancer (2 336 cases), which is not affected by the dominating reproductive factors, there was a suggestion of an increase in risk in occupations characterised by shift work. Night-shift work was recently classified as probably carcinogenic, with human evidence based on breast cancer research. The most common cancer among men in the present cohort was prostate cancer (339 973 cases). Despite the huge number of cases, we were unable to demonstrate any occupation-related risks. The observed small occupational variation could be easily explained by varying PSA test frequency. The Nordic countries are known for equity and free and equal access to health care for all citizens. The present study shows that the risk of cancer, even under these circumstances, is highly dependent on the person's position in the society. Direct occupational hazards seem to explain only a small percentage of the observed variation - but still a large number of cases - while indirect factors such as life style changes related to longer education and decreasing physical activity become more important. This publication is the first one from the extensive Nordic Occupational Cancer (NOCCA) project. Subsequent studies will focus on associations between specific work-related factors and cancer diseases with the aim to identify exposure-response patterns. In addition to the cancer data demonstrated in the present publication, the NOCCA project produced Nordic Job Exposure Matrix (described in separate articles in this issue of Acta Oncologica) that transforms information about occupational title histories to quantitative estimates of specific exposures. The third essential component is methodological development related to analysis and interpretation of results based on averaged information of exposures and co-factors in the occupational categories.</docText>

        <docText>Metamaterial lens applicator for microwave hyperthermia of breast cancer.

Artificial left-handed metamaterial (LHM) provides a new perspective for microwave hyperthermia. Four flat LHM slab lenses can be used to form a focus-flexible applicator for breast tumour hyperthermia. By adjusting microwave sources behind the four flat LHM lenses, microwaves emitted from the sources can be focused tightly at different points in the breast tissue so that necessary heating depth in breast tissue can be achieved. Numerical simulations with a two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method indicate that hyperthermia with the proposed four-lens applicator of moderate LHM losses could be effective in achieving desired power deposition in a heterogeneous breast model. Temperature distribution obtained by solving the bio-heat transfer equation demonstrates that temperature above 43 degrees C can be maintained in the tumour volume for specific periods of time. Flat slab LHM lenses offer a feasible alternative to traditional mechanically scanned lens applicator and electronically scanned phased-array applicators.</docText>

        <docText>Human epidermal growth factor receptor dimerization analysis in breast cancer diagnosis: potential for improving testing accuracy and treatment selection.

Our understanding of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of proteins has increased over the last few decades. It is clear from the vast assortment of research that has been and is currently being carried out that there is still a lot to be learned. HER dimerization is known to activate various downstream pathways that have an effect on treatment and therapy for breast cancer. HER dimerization acts as a mechanism not only for amplifying the signal pathway but also for signal diversification. There is clear evidence that molecular subtypes of cancer respond differently to different therapeutic options, which challenges the 'one size fits all' approach to chemotherapy in cancer. Here, we review the methods by which HER dimerization can be explored and the potential that this has in the treatment of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Early detection of breast cancer: new biomarker tests on the horizon?

When cancer is detected early, patients live longer, require less extensive treatment, and in general fare better than patients with more advanced disease. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Breast cancer screening through mammography has shown significant mortality reduction in clinical trials through the early detection of disease. This article aims to outline novel methods of indirect and direct detection of breast cancer through biomarkers. Proteomics and gene expression profiling methods will likely be important tools in regard to cancer detection in the future. Blood-based biomarker development is the furthest along and, either in the form of proteins or RNA, shows promise to lead to early detection techniques. Unfortunately, procedures aiming to analyze the breast tissue more directly have not had the desired outcomes thus far for the early detection of breast cancer. Appropriate development of these potential early detection and diagnostic tests is necessary prior to their clinical application, with special attention to their specificity to avoid overdiagnosis.</docText>

        <docText>Multifunctional Block Copolymer Micelles for the Delivery of (111)In to EGFR-Positive Breast Cancer Cells for Targeted Auger Electron Radiotherapy.

Block copolymer micelles (BCMs) can improve the payload delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors. Our aim was to construct hEGF-modified BCMs for the delivery of (111)In to tumor cells for Auger electron-emission radiotherapy of EGFR-positive breast cancer (BC). Multifunctional nanosized BCMs were prepared from MePEG(2500)-b-PCL(1200) and (111)In-DTPA-PEG(3000)-b-PCL(1600) with or without hEGF-PEG(2900)-b-PCL(1400) ((111)In-hEGF-BCMs or (111)In-BCMs). The resulting BCMs were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular uptake and nuclear importation were assessed in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 BC cells with decreasing EGFR density. In vitro antiproliferative effects were evaluated using the WST-1 assay after 48 h with (111)In-hEGF-BCMs, and the clonogenic assay was used to determine the survival fraction (SF) after a 21 h exposure. Results were compared with (111)In-DTPA-hEGF, an established Auger electron-emitting radiotherapeutic that is currently in clinical development. Cell uptake and nuclear importation of (111)In-hEGF-BCMs decreased in the following order: MDA-MB-468 &gt; MDA-MB-231 &gt; MCF-7. Cellular uptake of (111)In-hEGF-BCMs was less than (111)In-DTPA-hEGF (P &lt; 0.05) but was 4-fold higher than for (111)In-BCMs (P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant growth inhibition of MDA-MB-468 cells by (111)In-hEGF-BCMs (6-fold inhibition, P &lt; 0.05) while the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were not significantly inhibited. The SF of MDA-MB-468 cells was decreased to 2.6% while that for MCF-7 cells was 132.7%. (111)In-DTPA-hEGF reduced the SF of MDA-MB-468 cells to 0.4%. Nontargeted (111)In-BCMs had minimal effect on the SF of BC cells. Therefore, the (111)In-hEGF-BCMs were bound, internalized and transported to the nuclei of EGFR-positive BC cells, where the Auger electron emissions were lethal. The (111)In-hEGF-BCMs are a promising delivery system for targeted radiotherapy of BC.</docText>

        <docText>Changes and tracking of mammographic density in relation to Pike's model of breast tissue ageing: A UK longitudinal study.

Percent mammographic density (PMD) is a strong marker of breast cancer risk. It may be a correlate of the rate of breast tissue ageing, as proposed by Pike to explain breast cancer age-incidence. We examine longitudinal changes in PMD in 645 breast screening attendees in London UK who each had between 2 and 5 screens spanning 3 to 12 years at ages 50-65 years and compare these to Pike's model. Within-woman PMD declined during these ages, with a slowing rate of decline. Annual rates of decline were 1.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.2, 1.6), 0.7% (0.6, 0.7), and -0.1% (-0.2, 0.4) at ages 50, 57 and 64. Dense area declined similarly, but the absolute magnitude of the rate of increase of non-dense area was almost double that of dense area. PMD dropped by 2.4% (1.4, 3.4) on menopausal transition and increased by 2.4% (1.4, 3.5) with use of HT. Higher BMI, greater parity and being Afro-Caribbean or South Asian ethnicities were associated with lower PMD, but did not affect rate of change of PMD at these ages. Within-woman rank correlation of PMD was 0.80 for readings taken 9 years apart. Effects menopause and parity and the lack of effect of menarche on age-specific PMD at these ages are consistent with the predicted determinants in Pike's model. A high degree of tracking of PMD indicates that at ages 50-65 years high-risk women could be identified by a single early screen at age 50+. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docText>Reproductive risk factors and endometrial cancer: The European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition.

Endometrial cancer risk has been associated with reproductive factors (age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, age at first and last birth, time since last birth, and use of oral contraceptives). However, these factors are closely inter-related and whether they act independently still requires clarification. We conducted a study to examine the association of menstrual and reproductive variables with the risk of endometrial cancer among the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC).Among the 302,618 women eligible for the study, 1,017 incident endometrial cancer cases were identified. A reduction in endometrial cancer risk was observed in women with late menarche, early menopause, past oral contraceptive (OC) use, high parity, and a shorter time since last full term pregnancy (FTP). No association was observed for duration of breast-feeding after adjustment for number of FTP, or for abortion (spontaneous or induced). After mutual adjustment, late age at menarche, early age at menopause and duration of OC use showed similar risk reductions of 7-8% per year of menstrual life, whereas the decreased risk associated with cumulative duration of full-term pregnancies was stronger (22% per year).In conclusion, our findings confirmed a reduction in risk of endometrial cancer with factors associated with a lower cumulative exposure to estrogen and/or higher exposure to progesterone, such as increasing number of full-term pregnancies and shorter menstrual lifespan and therefore support an important role of hormonal mechanisms in endometrial carcinogenesis.

        <docTitle>Estrogen-induced angiogenic factors derived from stromal and cancer cells are differently regulated by enterolactone and genistein in human breast cancer in vivo.</docTitle>
        <docText>Estrogen-induced angiogenic factors derived from stromal and cancer cells are differently regulated by enterolactone and genistein in human breast cancer in vivo.

Angiogenesis is key in cancer progression and its regulators are released both by the tumor cells and the stroma. Dietary phytoestrogens, such as the lignan enterolactone (ENL) and the isoflavone genistein (GEN) may differently affect breast cancer growth. In this study human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were established in mice creating a tumor with species-specific cancer and stroma cells. Ovariectomized athymic mice supplemented with estradiol (E2) were fed basal AIN-93G diet (BD), or BD supplemented with 100 mg/kg ENL, 100 mg/kg GEN, or their combination (ENL+GEN). We show that ENL and ENL+GEN inhibited E2-induced cancer growth and angiogenesis while GEN alone did not. Microdialysis was used to sample extracellular proteins in tumors in vivo. ENL and ENL+GEN, decreased both stroma and cancer cell derived VEGF whereas cancer cell derived PlGF increased. In subcutaneous Matrigel plugs in mice, ENL and ENL+GEN decreased E2-induced endothelial cell infiltration whereas GEN alone did not. In endothelial cells, ENL inhibited E2-induced VEGFR-2 expression whereas GEN did not. These results suggest that ENL has potent effects on breast cancer growth, even in combination with GEN, by down regulating E2-stimulated angiogenic factors derived both from the stroma and the cancer cells while dietary GEN does not posses any anti-estrogenic effects.

        <docText>Results of the first phase 1 clinical trial of the HER-2/neu peptide (GP2) vaccine in disease-free breast cancer patients: united States Military Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Group Study I-04.

BACKGROUND:: HER-2/neu, overexpressed in breast cancer, is a source of immunogenic peptides that include GP2 and E75. Phase 2 testing of E75 as an adjuvant vaccine has suggested a clinical benefit. GP2, derived from the transmembrane portion of HER-2/neu, has differing binding characteristics and may be more immunogenic than E75. Results of the first phase 1 trial of GP2 peptide vaccine are presented. METHODS:: Disease-free, lymph node-negative, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2(+) breast cancer patients were enrolled. This dose escalation trial included 4 groups to determine safety and optimal GP2 peptide/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) dose. Toxicities were monitored. Immunologic response was assessed ex vivo via the HLA-A2:immunoglobulin dimer assay to detect GP2-specific CD8(+) T cells (and E75-specific CD8(+) T cells to assess epitope spreading) and in vivo via delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction (medians/ranges). RESULTS:: Eighteen patients were enrolled. All toxicities were grade &lt;/=2. Eight (88.9%) of 9 patients in the first 3 dose groups required GM-CSF dose reductions for local reactions &gt;/=100 mm or grade &gt;/=2 systemic toxicity. GM-CSF dose was reduced to 125 mug for the final dose group. All patients responded immunologically ex vivo (GP2-specific CD8(+) T cells from prevaccination to maximum, 0.4% [0.0%-2.0%] to 1.1% [0.4%-3.6%], P &lt; .001) and in vivo (GP2 pre- to postvaccination DTH, 0 mm [0.0-19.5 mm] to 27.5 mm [0.0-114.5 mm, P &lt; .001). E75-specific CD8(+) T cells also increased in response to GP2 from prevaccination to maximum (0.8% [0.0%-2.41%] to 1.6% [0.86%-3.72%], P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS:: The GP2 peptide vaccine appears safe and well tolerated with minimal local/systemic toxicity. GP2 elicited HER-2/neu-specific immune responses, including epitope spreading, in high-risk, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. These findings support further investigation of the GP2 vaccine for the prevention of breast cancer recurrence. Cancer 2010. (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.</docText>

        <docText>SPECT/CT for preoperative sentinel node localization.

The value of SPECT/CT for detection and localization of sentinel nodes is reviewed. SPECT/CT depicts extra sentinel nodes and identifies non-nodal tracer accumulation. SPECT/CT is indicated in patients with complex lymphatic drainage as often present in patients with head, neck and scapular melanoma, breast cancer patients with extra-axillary sentinel nodes and patients with tumors draining to pelvic nodes. SPECT/CT also clarifies the drainage pattern of inconclusive conventional images (non-visualization or unclear location of the nodes). J. Surg. Oncol. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</docText>

        <docText>Longitudinal change of treatment-related upper limb dysfunction and its impact on late dysfunction in breast cancer survivors: A prospective cohort study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of upper limb dysfunction (ULD) and subtypes after breast cancer surgery and to identify factors associated with late ULD. METHODS: Among 191 enrolled patients, 191 were evaluated at 3 months, 187 at 6 months, and 183 at 12 months after surgery. Pain, shoulder range of motion, muscle strength, and arm circumference were assessed. Based on symptoms and physical examinations, the types of ULD common after breast cancer treatment were diagnosed and categorized. RESULTS: The prevalence of ULD after surgery were 24.6%, 20.9%, and 26.8% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The most common types of ULD were pectoralis tightness at 3 and 6 months and lymphedema at 12 months. Patients with pectoralis tightness or lymphedema at 3 or 6 months showed a higher prevalence of rotator cuff disease at 12 months compared with those without early pectoralis tightness or lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: The major post-operative ULD were pectoralis tightness at 3 and 6 months and lymphedema at 12 months. Late ULD such as rotator cuff disease were associated with pectoral tightness or lymphedema at earlier stages. Diagnosis and treatment of ULD should take place as soon as possible after surgery. J.

        <docText>Obesity and cancer.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types including colon, esophagus, breast (in postmenopausal women), endometrium, kidney, liver, gallbladder and pancreas. Suggested mechanisms include increased intake of potentially carcinogenic food ingredients along with excessive amount of calories, loss of cancer protective effects due to reduced physical activity, carcinogenic factors released from increased adipose tissue mass and "secondary" associations via "precursor" condition such as gallstones. The increased cancer risk in patients with obesity is a neglected topic which deserves more scientific attention. Because of its extreme chronicity and co-association with numerous other conditions true causality and underlying mechanisms are difficult to study. Nevertheless, a large body of literature is already available which provides concepts for future research.</docText>

        <docTitle>Nuclear IRS-1 predicts tamoxifen response in patients with early breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Nuclear IRS-1 predicts tamoxifen response in patients with early breast cancer.

Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein that is phosphorylated by insulin-like growth factor-I receptor and recruits downstream effectors. Recent evidence suggests that IRS-1 has a nuclear localization and function. Here we investigated whether nuclear and cytoplasmic IRS-1 levels are associated with clinico-pathological characteristics and clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Tissue microarrays from 1,097 patients with stage I-II breast cancer were stained by immunohistochemistry for IRS-1. Nuclear and cytoplasmic IRS-1 were scored separately according to the Allred score. Nuclear IRS-1 showed a positive association with estrogen receptor (ER) (r = 0.09, P = 0.003) and progesterone receptor (PR) (r = 0.08, P = 0.008) status and a negative correlation with lymph node involvement (r = -0.10, P = 0.001). Cytoplasmic IRS-1 did not correlate with ER or PR but showed a positive correlation with tumor size (r = 0.10, P = 0.001) and S-phase fraction (r = 0.16, P &lt; 0.001). In univariate analysis, tamoxifen-treated patients with tumors showing positive nuclear IRS-1 had a better recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.009) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0007), while no association was shown between cytoplasmic IRS-1 and RFS or OS in the same group of patients. In multivariate analysis of patients receiving tamoxifen, negative nuclear IRS-1 showed a significantly reduced RFS (P = 0.046) and OS (P = 0.018). Combining both PR and nuclear IRS-1, tamoxifen-treated patients with PR+/IRS-1+ tumors had a better RFS (P = 0.0003) and OS (P &lt; 0.0001) when compared with patients with PR-/IRS-1- tumors. In conclusion, nuclear IRS-1 may be a useful marker to predict tamoxifen response in patients with early breast cancer, particularly when assessed in combination with PR.</docText>

        <docTitle>Association of rare MSH6 variants with familial breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Association of rare MSH6 variants with familial breast cancer.

Germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 predispose to Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). Recently, we have shown that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation also is associated with Lynch syndrome/Lynch syndrome-associated families albeit in a polygenic setting. Two of the ten CHEK2 1100delC positive Lynch syndrome families additionally carried a pathogenic MLH1 or MSH6 mutation, suggesting that mutations in mismatch repair genes may be involved in CHEK2 1100delC-associated cancer phenotypes. A phenotype of importance is hereditary breast and colorectal cancer (HBCC), with the CHEK2 1100delC mutation present in almost one-fifth of the families-again in a polygenic setting. In order to evaluate the involvement of MSH6 in polygenic CHEK2 cancer susceptibility, we, here, have analyzed the entire MSH6 coding sequence for genetic alterations in 68 HBCC breast cancer families. Rare MSH6 variants, with population frequencies below 1%, were identified in 11.8% of HBCC breast cancer families, whereas the same variants were identified in only 1.5% of population controls, suggesting that rare MSH6 variants are associated with HBCC breast cancer (P &lt;/= 0.00001). However, screening of the entire MSH6 coding sequence in 68 non-HBCC breast cancer families showed a similar association (8.8 vs. ~1.4% in controls, P &lt;/= 0.001), suggesting that rare MSH6 variants are not confined to HBCC breast cancer. Together, our data suggest that rare MSH6 variants may predispose to familial breast cancer. However, none of the rare MSH6 variants are obviously pathogenic, suggesting that a more subtle disease mechanism may operate in breast carcinogenesis.</docText>

        <docTitle>Borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors display similar promoter methylation profiles.</docTitle>
        <docText>Borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors display similar promoter methylation profiles.

Mammary phyllodes tumors (PTs) are uncommon fibroepithelial neoplasms. On the basis of histologic criteria, PTs can be divided into benign, borderline, and malignant groups; however, the histologic distinction of PTs is often difficult and arbitrary. In breast cancer, promoter hypermethylation is a common phenomenon, but there are no data available concerning methylation status in PTs. The aim of this study was to assess whether the methylation profiles support the classification of PTs into three subgroups. A multiplex, nested, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction approach was used to examine promoter methylation of five genes (GSTP1, HIN-1, RAR-beta, RASSF1A, and Twist) in 87 PTs (54 benign, 23 borderline, and 10 malignant). Immunohistochemical staining for GSTP1 was performed using tissue microarray blocks to determine whether GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation correlated with loss of GSTP1 expression. There was a trend of increasing methylation frequency with increasing grade of PTs. The methylation frequency of all genes and the mean number of methylated genes in borderline and malignant PTs were higher than those in benign PTs; however, there were no statistically significant differences between borderline and malignant PTs. GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation was associated with loss of GSTP1 expression (p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that PTs segregate into only two groups on the basis of their methylation profiles: the benign group and the combined borderline/malignant group.</docText>

        <docTitle>Control of TCF-4 expression by VDR and vitamin D in the mouse mammary gland and colorectal cancer cell lines.</docTitle>
        <docText>Control of TCF-4 expression by VDR and vitamin D in the mouse mammary gland and colorectal cancer cell lines.

BACKGROUND: The vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway is important in the prevention and potentially in the treatment of many cancers. One important mechanism of VDR action is related to its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Agonist-bound VDR inhibits the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF pathway by interacting directly with beta-catenin and in some cells by increasing cadherin expression which, in turn, recruits beta-catenin to the membrane. Here we identify TCF-4, a transcriptional regulator and beta-catenin binding partner as an indirect target of the VDR pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we show that TCF-4 (gene name TCF7L2) is decreased in the mammary gland of the VDR knockout mouse as compared to the wild-type mouse. Furthermore, we show 1,25(OH)2D3 increases TCF-4 at the RNA and protein levels in several human colorectal cancer cell lines, the effect of which is completely dependent on the VDR. In silico analysis of the human and mouse TCF7L2 promoters identified several putative VDR binding elements. Although TCF7L2 promoter reporters responded to exogenous VDR, and 1,25(OH)2D3, mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, showed that the increase in TCF7L2 did not require recruitment of the VDR to the identified elements and indicates that the regulation by VDR is indirect. This is further confirmed by the requirement of de novo protein synthesis for this up-regulation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although it is generally assumed that binding of beta-catenin to members of the TCF/LEF family is cancer-promoting, recent studies have indicated that TCF-4 functions instead as a transcriptional repressor that restricts breast and colorectal cancer cell growth. Consequently, we conclude that the 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR-mediated increase in TCF-4 may have a protective role in colon cancer as well as diabetes and Crohn's disease.</docText>

        <docText>Targeting HER2 signaling pathway for radiosensitization: Alternative strategy for therapeutic resistance.

Several studies have indicated the potential value of targeting HER-2 signaling to enhance the anti-tumor activity of ionizing radiation. However, therapeutic resistance resulting from several factors, including activation of the downstream pathway, represents a major obstacle to treatment. Here, we investigated whether inhibitors targeting downstream of HER-2 signaling would radiosensitize SKBR3 breast cancer cells that exhibit overamplification of HER2. Selective inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling using pharmacologic inhibitors (PD98059, UO126) did not increase the radiosensitivity of SKBR3 cells. Selective inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway using pharmacologic inhibitors (LY294002, AKT inhibitor VIII, Rapamycin) significantly attenuated expression of p-AKT and p-70S6K, respectively and radiosensitized SKBR3 cells. MCF-7 cells those did not overexpress HER-2, showed less radiosensitization compared to SKBR3 cells by inhibition of this pathway. Pre-treatment with these inhibitors also caused significant abrogation of typical G(2) arrest following ionizing radiation and induced marked prolongation of gammaH2AX foci indicating impairment of DNA damage repair. A dual inhibitor of Class I PI3K and mTOR, PI103 effectively radiosensitized SKBR3 cells and showed significant prolongation of gammaH2AX foci. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling was associated with downregulation of DNA-PKs, respectively. While apoptosis was the major mode of cell death when the cells were pretreated with LY294002 or AKT inhibitor VIII, the cells were pretreated by rapamycin or PI103 showed mixed mode of cell death including autophagy. Our results suggest possible mechanisms to counteract the HER-2 prosurvival signaling implicated in radioresistance, and offer an alternative strategy to overcome resistance to HER-2 inhibitors combined with radiation.</docText>

        <docText>The reverse Warburg effect: Aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated fibroblasts and the tumor stroma.

Here, we propose a new model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism. Our hypothesis is that epithelial cancer cells induce the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) in neighboring stromal fibroblasts. These cancer-associated fibroblasts, then undergo myo-fibroblastic differentiation, and secrete lactate and pyruvate (energy metabolites resulting from aerobic glycolysis). Epithelial cancer cells could then take up these energy-rich metabolites and use them in the mitochondrial TCA cycle, thereby promoting efficient energy production (ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation), resulting in a higher proliferative capacity. In this alternative model of tumorigenesis, the epithelial cancer cells instruct the normal stroma to transform into a wound-healing stroma, providing the necessary energy-rich micro-environment for facilitating tumor growth and angiogenesis. In essence, the fibroblastic tumor stroma would directly feed the epithelial cancer cells, in a type of host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new idea the "Reverse Warburg Effect." In this scenario, the epithelial tumor cells "corrupt" the normal stroma, turning it into a factory for the production of energy-rich metabolites. This alternative model is still consistent with Warburg's original observation that tumors show a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. In support of this idea, unbiased proteomic analysis and transcriptional profiling of a new model of cancer-associated fibroblasts (caveolin-1 (Cav-1) deficient stromal cells), shows the upregulation of both (1) myo-fibroblast markers and (2) glycolytic enzymes, under normoxic conditions. We validated the expression of these proteins in the fibroblastic stroma of human breast cancer tissues that lack stromal Cav-1. Importantly, a loss of stromal Cav-1 in human breast cancers is associated with tumor recurrence, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome. Thus, an absence of stromal Cav-1 may be a biomarker for the "Reverse Warburg Effect," explaining its powerful predictive value.</docText>

        <docTitle>Identification of intergenic trans-regulatory RNAs containing a disease-linked SNP sequence and targeting cell cycle progression/differentiation pathways in multiple common human disorders.</docTitle>
        <docText>Identification of intergenic trans-regulatory RNAs containing a disease-linked SNP sequence and targeting cell cycle progression/differentiation pathways in multiple common human disorders.

Meta-analysis of genomic coordinates of SNP variations identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 712,253 samples (comprising 221,158 disease cases, 322,862 controls, and 168,233 case/control subjects of obesity GWAS) reveals that 39% of SNPs associated with 22 common human disorders are located within intergenic regions. Chromatin-state maps based on H3K4me3-H3K36me3 signatures show that many intergenic disease-linked SNPs are located within the boundaries of the K4-K36 domains, suggesting that SNP-harboring genomic regions are transcribed. Here we report identification of 13 trans-regulatory RNAs (transRNAs) 100 to 200 nucleotides in length containing intergenic SNP sequences associated with Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, hypertension and multiple types of epithelial malignancies (prostate, breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers). We demonstrate that NALP1 loci intergenic SNP sequence, rs2670660, is expressed in human cells and may contribute to clinical manifestations of autoimmune and autoimflammatory phenotypes by generating distinct allelic variants of transRNAs. Stable expression of allele-specific sense and anti-sense variants of transRNAs markedly alters cellular behavior, affect cell cycle progression, and interfere with monocyte/macrophage transdifferentiation. On a molecular level, forced expression of allele-specific sense and anti-sense variants of transRNAs asserts allele-specific genome-wide effects on abundance of hundreds microRNAs and mRNAs. Using lentiviral gene transfer, microarray and Q-RT-PCR technologies, we identify rs2670660 allele-specific gene expression signatures (GES) which appear useful for detecting the activated states of innate immunity/inflammasome pathways in approximately 700 clinical samples from 185 control subjects and 350 patients diagnosed with nine common human disorders, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington disease, autism, Alzheimer disease, obesity, prostate and breast cancers. Microarray analysis of clinical samples demonstrates that rs2670660 allele-specific GES are engaged in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) which encounter pathological conditions in coherent tissues of a human body during immune surveillance and homeostasis monitoring. These data indicate that expression of transRNAs encoded by specific intergenic sequences can trigger activation of innate immunity/inflammasome pathways and contribute to clinical development of autoinflammatory and autoimmune syndromes. Documented in this work single-base substitution-driven molecular and biological antagonisms of intergenic SNP-containing transRNAs suggest a guiding mechanism of selection and retention of phenotype-compatible intergenic variations during evolution. According to this model, random genetic variations which generate transRNAs asserting antagonistic phenotype-altering effects compared to ancestral alleles will be selected and retained as SNP variants.</docText>

        <docText>Reevaluating cathepsin D as a biomarker for breast cancer: Serum activity levels versus histopathology.

Cathepsin D is a lysosomal hydrolase involved in intra- and extracellular proteolysis. This enzyme is aberrantly produced and processed in malignancy, and most notably is over-secreted into the tumor cell microenvironment. This hyper-secretion may lead to excessive degradation of the extracellular matrix, and contribute to tumor progression and metastases. These phenomena have been established in vitro, and there is evidence that Cathepsin D is similarly dysregulated in human breast cancer patients. Because breast cancer lacks an effective screening or surveillance biomarker, here we address the hypothesis that serum Cathepsin D activity may be useful to assess the presence or progression of breast cancer in females. While representative histologic sections from various disease-specific cohorts confirm previous findings that increased Cathepsin D production and secretion correlate with tumor progression, we report no difference in serum Cathepsin D activity between patients who are disease free, patients with pre-invasive or limited invasive disease, and patients with metastatic disease. Furthermore, in patients with known metastatic disease, there were no clinical variables associated with significantly different serum Cathepsin D activity. However, the immunohistochemical localization of Cathepsin D expression in histopathologic sections from breast cancer patients correlates with disease progression. Based on the serum results, and in contradistinction to Cathepsin D localization in breast cancer tissues, our findings support using Cathepsin D as a reliable histopathology biomarker for disease progression, but not for serum screening.</docText>

        <docTitle>Effects of Supportive-Expressive Group Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients with Affective Disorders: A Pilot Study.</docTitle>
        <docText>Effects of Supportive-Expressive Group Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients with Affective Disorders: A Pilot Study.

Background: So far, no study has tested supportive-expressive group therapy (SEGT) in cancer patients with an established psychiatric diagnosis. The aim of this 6-month follow-up study was to evaluate breast cancer patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of affective syndromes participating in SEGT and a group of breast cancer patients with no ICD-10 diagnosis. Methods: A total of 214 patients were examined in the screening phase (T0) using the ICD-10, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the Mini-Mental Adjustment-to-Cancer Scale (Mini-MAC), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Openness Scale and the Cancer Worries Inventory (CWI). Those with an ICD-10 diagnosis of affective syndromes received 16-24 sessions of SEGT (90-min sessions, once a week), while those with no ICD-10 diagnosis were followed up. A second assessment for both sam- ples took place 6 months later (T1). Results: Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients were positive for an ICD-10 diagnosis of affective syndromes at T0, while 127 (59.4%) did not meet any ICD-10 diagnosis. Among the former, 54 patients participated in the SEGT. At T1, significant differences were observed in all the dimensions of the BSI, hopelessness and anxious preoccupation subscales of the Mini-MAC, the Openness Scale and the CWI. No variable at T0 was a predictor of BSI distress as measured at T1. Among those with no ICD-10 diagnosis at T0, 8.2% were positive for affective disorders at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study suggested that SEGT is effective for breast cancer patients with affective disorders, and indicates the need for prospective evaluations in order to identify those who may develop psychopathology over time.</docText>

        <docText>Cone Beam Breast CT noise reduction using 3D adaptive Gaussian filtering.

In Cone Beam Breast CT (CBBCT) imaging, noise causes degradation of three dimensional breast images, impeding correct diagnosis of breast cancer. Within Feldkamp's cone beam reconstruction framework, applying weighted reconstruction filters to the projection images after pre-processing procedures has long been used to reduce noise and improve image quality. However, CBBCT noise is distributed across frequencies along with the useful signal. Various reconstruction filters working in the frequency domain suppress noise as well as the edge detail signal. Based on fuzzy c-means clustering and the two-dimensional histogram analysis of a large number of clinical CBBCT data, we managed to discriminate fatty stroma, glandular tissues and the transition areas between these tissues by the local mean and standard deviation values. We also proposed a three-dimensional Gaussian filtering scheme to reduce the noise in 3D reconstructed images adaptively without much blurring of detail signal.</docText>

        <docText>Analysis of predictive tools for further axillary involvement in patients with sentinel lymph node positive small (&lt;/=15 mm) invasive breast cancer.

Small breast cancers often require different treatment than larger ones. The frequency and predictability of further nodal involvement was evaluated in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes and breast cancers &lt;/=15 mm by means of 8 different predictive tools. Of 506 patients with such small tumors 138 with positive sentinel nodes underwent axillary dissection and 39 of these had non-sentinel node involvement too. The Stanford nomogram and the micrometastatic nomogram were the predictive tools identifying a small group of patients with low probability of further axillary involvement that might not require completion axillary lymph node dissection. Our data also suggest that the Tenon score can separate subsets of patients with a low and a higher risk of non-sentinel node metastasis. Predictive tools based on multivariate models can help in omitting completion axillary dissection in patients with low risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis based on their small tumor size.</docText>

        <docText>Correlation analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor-C expression and clinicopathology in breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), C-erbB-2, p53, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) in breast cancer tissue and their clinical significance. METHODS: The expressions of C-erbB-2, p53, ER, and PR in 60 breast cancer tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry, and their clinical significance was analyzed. RESULTS: The positivity rates of VEGF-C, C-erbB-2, p53, ER, and PR in the 60 breast cancer tissues were 56.7%, 38.3%, 46.7%, 48.3% and 53.3%, respectively. The expressions of VEGF-C and C-erbB-2 differed significantly in relation to the lymph node status (P&lt;0.05), but not to the patient's age or tumor volume (P&gt;0.05). The expression of VEGF-C was positively correlated to that of C-erbB-2 (P&lt;0.05). The expression of p53 was positively correlated to the tumor volume (P&lt;0.05). The expressions of ER and PR were not correlated to the patient's age, tumor volume and lymph node status (P&gt;0.05), but were inversely correlated to C-erbB-2 expression (P&lt;0.05) independent of VEGF-C and p53 expressions (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The high expressions of VEGF-C and C-erbB-2 are closely related to lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients, and may cooperate in promoting lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma. Combined detection of VEGF-C, C-erbB-2, p53, ER and PR may help clinical treatment and prognostic evaluation of breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin in Her2-positive breast cancer and its implications.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between positive expression of Her2 and abnormal expressions of beta-catenin and E-cadherin and its implications. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expressions of Her2, beta-catenin and E-cadherin in 147 samples of human breast carcinoma. The expressions of beta-catenin and E-cadherin were also detected in 19 tissues adjacent to the carcinoma and 17 benign breast lesions as controls. RESULTS: In breast carcinoma, positive Her2 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage and negative expression of ER and PR (P&lt;0.05). Abnormal beta-catenin expression was associated with positive lymph node status and high histological grade (P&lt;0.01). Abnormality of E-cadherin expression was related to lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage (P&lt;0.05). Abnormal beta-catenin expression was directly correlated with abnormal E-cadherin expression (P&lt;0.01). Her2 positivity showed a direct correlation to abnormal beta-catenin expression (P&lt;0.01), and they cooperated in promoting axillary lymph node metastasis in human breast carcinoma (P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: A direct correlation between positive Her2 expression and abnormal beta-catenin expression exists in human breast carcinoma, and positive Her2 expression may have functional interactions with abnormal activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluation on parallel HER-2 testing using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in breast cancer tissues.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of the immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detecting the amplification and the expression of HER-2 gene in the breast cancer patients. METHODS: Sixty-six cases of paraffin-embeded breast cancer samples with overexpression, low or no expression of HER-2 gene as detected by IHC were analyzed for HER-2 gene amplification using FISH. RESULTS: Among the 42 samples with HER-2 gene overexpression (3+/2+) detected by IHC, 31 showed positive HER-2 gene amplification and 11 showed negative HER-2 gene amplification in FISH. In the 24 samples with low or no HER-2 gene expression (1+/-) detected by IHC, no HER-2 gene amplification was detected by FISH. The results of the two testing methods showed a good consistency with the kappa coefficient of 0.672 (P&lt;0.001). We also found that the 17 chromosome polysomy in 42% of the samples and the incidence of 17 polysomy was significantly higher in the HER-2 gene overexpression (3+/2+) group than in low or no HER-2 gene expression (1+/-) group (chi(2)=4.688, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: IHC can be used as a screening method for detecting HER-2 gene amplification, and FISH should be performed in cases of HER-2 gene overexpression (3+/2+) as detected by IHC.</docText>

        <docText>Construction of an expression vector carrying short hairpin RNA targeting hTERT gene and its effects on breast cancer cell telomerase activity and proliferation in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To construct a RNA interference expression vector targeting human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) gene and investigate its effects on telomerase activity and proliferation in breast cancer cells in vitro. METHODS: The shRNA sequences targeting hTERT gene were designed and recombined into pSuper-retro-puro vector. The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 were transfected with the recombined vector, and the telomerase activity of the cells was tested by telomerase repeat sequence amplification-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (TRAP-ELISA). The proliferation of the transfected cells was assessed using MTT and soft-agar clone formation assays. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmids pSuper-retro-puro-TERT RNAi#1 and #2 were successfully constructed as confirmed by enzymatic digestion and DNA sequencing. The telomerase activity in the transfected breast cancer cells were down-regulated significantly as compared with that in negative control cells (Plt;0.005). The transfection resulted in significant inhibition of the proliferation of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells as detected by MTT assay (Plt;0.05) and soft agar clone formation assay (Plt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Transfection with the recombinant plasmid containing the shRNA targeting hTERT gene can down-regulate telomerase activity and inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, suggesting the potential of gene therapy targeting telomerase in the treatment of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Optimal gantry angles and field sizes in kilovoltage cone-beam tomosynthesis for set-up of women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.

Optimal beam geometry for kilovoltage cone-beam tomosynthesis (CB-TS) imaging for the set-up of 20 patients with breast cancer was analyzed and presented for prone and supine scenarios. Gantry angles and field sizes that allow maximum clearance and minimum dose to normal organs from kilovoltage imaging were determined for medial and lateral arcs. Optimal CB-TS arc span may vary depending on patient geometry, particularly on the separation between the cavity and the chest wall. CB-TS arc angles 40 degrees were found to be optimal for the cavity to chest wall separation d&gt;3cm for supine set-up and d&gt;7cm for prone set-up. Maximum required jaw openings were 20x14cm(2). Recommendations are provided for clinical implementation of CB-TS imaging for breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>En garde, sentinel node!

Injection technique and radiocolloid size are two critical parameters that must be carefully selected according to patient presentation and lesion appearance for accurate sentinel node detection in breast cancer. Scintigraphic detection and intraoperative localization are dependent on these parameters. The present clinical case illustrates how much deep intralesional tracer injection bears on our capacity to detect extra-axillary sentinel nodes and how the use of smaller-size radiocolloids may sometimes facilitate sentinel node detection.</docText>

        <docText>Sentinel node in gynaecological cancers. Our experience.

Although sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification is widespread used in melanoma and breast cancer some concerns exist in other malignancies, such gynaecologic cancers, and this staging method has not been adopted in many centers due to lack or large validation studies. AIM: To evaluate the applicability and results of SLN technique in gynaecological malignancies referred to our institution. METHOD: We studied 155 patients with different malignancies (70 vulvar, 50 cervical and 35 endometrial cancers). The day before surgery a lymphoscintigraphy was performed by injecting 111MBq of 99mTc-nanocolloid in several ways depending on the type of cancer studied. Intraoperative detection of the SLN was always performed by using a hand-held gammaprobe and, in 100 cases with the aid of blue dye injection (70 vulvar and 30 in cervical cancer) few minutes before surgical intervention. Pathological study of SLN was performed in all cases. Lymphadenectomy was done in all cervix and endometrial cancer patients and in the first 35 vulvar cancer patients. RESULTS: Pre-surgical lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated one, at least, SLN in 97% of vulvar cancer patients, 92% in the cervical malignancy and 64% in the endometrial cancer patiuents. During surgery, SLN was harvested in 97%, 90% and 62% of patients, respectively. The pathological study showed metastases in 24.2%, 8.8 and 4.5% of patients with vulvar, cervical and endometrial cancer, respectively. The false negative percentage was 5.5% in vulvar cancer patients, with 2 cases in the endometrial cancer and without any case in the cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Lymphoscintigraphy is a relatively simple and useful technique to identify the SLN in this kind of tumours. However, in endometrial cancer more effort has to be made to reach a suitable result. Sentinel lymphm node biopsy seems to be a reliable technique in vulvar and cervical malignancies.</docText>

        <docText>Levels of plasma circulating cell free nuclear and mitochondrial DNA as potential biomarkers for breast tumors.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: With the aim to simplify cancer management, cancer research lately dedicated itself more and more to discover and develop non-invasive biomarkers. In this connection, circulating cell-free DNA (ccf DNA) seems to be a promising candidate. Altered levels of ccf nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found in several cancer types and might have a diagnostic value. METHODS: Using multiplex real-time PCR we investigated the levels of ccf nDNA and mtDNA in plasma samples from patients with malignant and benign breast tumors, and from healthy controls. To evaluate the applicability of plasma ccf nDNA and mtDNA as a biomarker for distinguishing between the three study-groups we performed ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis. We also compared the levels of both species in the cancer group with clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: While the levels of ccf nDNA in the cancer group were significantly higher in comparison with the benign tumor group (P &lt; 0.001) and the healthy control group (P &lt; 0.001), the level of ccf mtDNA was found to be significantly lower in the two tumor-groups (benign: P &lt; 0.001; malignant: P = 0.022). The level of ccf nDNA was also associated with tumor-size (&lt;2 cm vs. &gt;2 cm&lt;5 cm; 2250 vs. 6658; Mann-Whitney-U-Test: P = 0.034). Using ROC curve analysis, we were able to distinguish between the breast cancer cases and the healthy controls using ccf nDNA as marker (cut-off: 1866 GE/ml; sensitivity: 81%; specificity: 69%; P &lt; 0.001) and between the tumor group and the healthy controls using ccf mtDNA as marker (cut-off: 463282 GE/ml; sensitivity: 53%; specificity: 87%; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that nuclear and mitochondrial ccf DNA have potential as biomarkers in breast tumor management. However, ccf nDNA shows greater promise regarding sensitivity and specificity.</docText>

        <docText>Chromogenic in situ hybridization for Her-2/neu-oncogene in breast cancer: comparison of a new dual-colour chromogenic in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Aims: Her-2/neu testing is used as a marker for Herceptin((R)) therapy. The aim was to investigate new dual-colour chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), in a large number of breast carcinomas (n = 205) with DNA-specific dual-colour probes (ZytoVision, Bremerhaven, Germany) and to compare the results with immunohistochemistry (n = 205) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (n = 129). Methods and results: Paraffin-embedded tissue of 205 patients was used. After immunohistochemistry with a focus on immunohistochemically uncertain cases, Her-2/neu amplification using dual-colour CISH (ZytoVision((R))) was analysed. Validation by FISH was performed. The results were: immunohistochemistry, 27.8% with strong expression, 53.7% with uncertain overexpression and 18.5% with no expression; FISH, 25.6% amplified and 74.4% negative; CISH, 35.6% amplified, 62.9% negative and 1.5% not evaluable. Comparison of immunohistochemistry with CISH: CISH negative in 100% with immunohistochemistry 0/1+, amplified in 82.5% with immunohistochemistry 3+; 5.9% contradictory results: 4.4% immunohistochemistry 3+ and negative by CISH, 1.5% negative in immunohistochemistry but amplified by CISH; FISH (129 cases), 8.5% contradictory results to immunohistochemistry, 6.2% immunohistochemistry 3+ and negative by FISH, 2.3% negative by immunohistochemistry and amplified by FISH; comparison of CISH and FISH, 94.6% same results, 3.9% different ones, 1.6% CISH not analysable. Conclusions: CISH, using dual-colour probes (ZytoVision((R))) is as good as FISH for Her-2/neu analysis. The few discrepant results are likely to be caused by polysomy or tumour heterogeneity.</docText>

        <docText>Microglandular adenosis or microglandular adenoma? A molecular genetic analysis of a case associated with atypia and invasive carcinoma.

Aims: Microglandular adenosis (MGA) is a rare breast lesion, which has long been considered to be hyperplastic. However, atypical forms of MGA (AMGA) and invasive carcinomas arising in the background of MGA are recorded. Recent studies have suggested that MGA may be a non-obligate precursor of invasive carcinomas that are negative for hormone receptors and lack HER-2 overexpression (triple-negative phenotype). The aim of this study was to determine whether MGA is clonal and whether it harbours chromosomal aberrations similar to those found in matched invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST). Methods and results: We report on a case comprising MGA, AMGA and a high-grade IDC-NST. The three components were separately microdissected and subjected to genetic analysis with high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridisation. Identical genetic changes were detected in all components with subsequent acquisition of additional genetic aberrations in the invasive component, suggesting that MGA was the substrate for the development of the invasive carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed concordant profiles across all components, characterized by triple-negative phenotype and variable positivity for basal markers. Conclusions: Similar to adenomas, MGA is, at least in some cases, a clonal lesion and may be a non-obligate precursor of a subgroup of high-grade triple-negative and basal-like breast carcinomas.</docText>

        <docText>Berry anthocyanins and anthocyanidins exhibit distinct affinities for the efflux transporters BCRP and MDR1.

Background and purpose: Dietary anthocyanins hold great promise in the prevention of chronic disease but factors affecting their bioavailability remain poorly defined. Specifically, the role played by transport mechanisms at the intestinal and blood-brain barriers (BBB) is currently unknown. Experimental approach: In the present study, 16 anthocyanins and anthocyanidins were exposed to the human efflux transporters multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), using dye efflux, ATPase and, for BCRP, vesicular transport assays. Key results: All test compounds interacted with the BCRP transporter in vitro. Of these, seven emerged as potential BCRP substrates (malvidin, petunidin, malvidin-3-galactoside, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin-3-galactoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside) and 12 as potential inhibitors of BCRP (cyanidin, peonidin, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, malvidin, pelargonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, malvidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside, malvidin-3-galactoside). Malvidin, malvidin-3-galactoside and petunidin exhibited bimodal activities serving as BCRP substrates at low concentrations and, at higher concentrations, as BCRP inhibitors. Effects on MDR1, in contrast, were weak. Only aglycones exerted mild inhibitory activity. Conclusions and implications: Although the anthocyanidins under study may alter pharmacokinetics of drugs that are BCRP substrates, they are less likely to interfere with activities of MDR1 substrates. The present data suggest that several anthocyanins and anthocyanidins may be actively transported out of intestinal tissues and endothelia, limiting their bioavailability in plasma and brain.</docText>

        <docTitle>Skin metastasis: a pathologist's perspective.</docTitle>
        <docText>Skin metastasis: a pathologist's perspective.

Skin metastasis is defined as the spread of malignant cells from a primary malignancy to the skin. It is one manifestation of systemic spread of cancer. The tumor cells originate either from an internal malignancy or from a primary skin cancer. This study presents a literature review concerning these issues as well as this author's experience encountered throughout 19 years of surgical pathology and dermatopathology practice. Several conclusions are evident. Generally, skin metastases are encountered in 0.7-9% of all patients with cancer and as such the skin is an uncommon site of metastatic disease when compared to other organs. There is usually a long-time lag between the diagnosis of the primary malignancy and the recognition of the skin metastases. However, these metastases may be the first indication of the clinically silent visceral malignancies. The regional distribution of the skin metastasis, although not always predictable, is related to the location of the primary malignancy and the mechanism of metastatic spread. The relative frequency of skin metastasis correlates with the type of primary cancer, which occurs in each sex. For instance, lung and breast carcinomas are the most common primaries that send skin metastasis in men and women, respectively. The head and neck region and the anterior chest are the areas of greatest predilection in men. The anterior chest wall and the abdomen are the most commonly involved sites in women. Skin metastases usually appear as non-specific groups of discrete firm painless nodules that emerge rapidly without any explanation. They vary in size from so tiny as to be of 'miliary lesions' to as large as 'Hen's egg size'. Some skin metastasis may mimic specific dermatological conditions such as cutaneous cyst, dermatofibroma, pyogenic granuloma, hemangioma, papular eruptions, herpes zoster eruptions, rapidly infiltrating plaques, alopecic patches, cellulitis and erysipelas. Histologically, the skin metastases usually show features reminiscent of the primary malignancy, but with variable degrees of differentiation. Molecularly, skin metastasis is an organized, non-random and organ-selective process orchestrated by interaction among several heterogeneous molecules, which are largely unknown. Metastasis to the skin is often a pre-terminal event that heralds poor outcome. Hussein MRA. Skin metastasis: a pathologist's perspective.</docText>

        <docText>Detection of breast cancer by soft-copy reading of digital mammograms: comparison between a routine image-processing parameter and high-contrast parameters.

Background: Recent studies have reported the clinical usefulness of the soft-copy reading of mammograms. However, image-processing parameters for soft-copy reading of digital mammograms have not been established. Purpose: To compare observer performance in detecting breast cancer by soft-copy reading of digital mammograms using a routine image-processing parameter versus each of several high-contrast parameters. Material and Methods: The mammograms of 154 breasts, including 48 abnormal breasts with breast cancer and 106 normal breasts, were examined. Cancers were classified into 34 mass-dominant cancers, 11 microcalcification-dominant cancers, two cancers showing only architectural distortion, and one cancer without abnormal findings. All mammograms were performed using a computed radiography (CR) system. Each image was processed using GA (1.2), which was the contrast parameter recommended by the manufacturer for hard-copy film, GA (1.4), GA (1.6), and GA (1.8). These images were displayed on 5-megapixel (M) liquid-crystal display monitors. Five experienced radiologists classified them into BI-RADS category 1-2 or 3-5, and were also asked to rate the images on a scale of 0 to 100 for the likelihood of the presence of masses and microcalcifications in each breast. Results: In mass-dominant cancers of dense breast tissue, the mean sensitivities of GA (1.2), GA (1.4), GA (1.6), and GA (1.8) were 32.7, 38.2, 36.4, and 40.0, and the A(Z) values were 0.67, 0.73, 0.71, and 0.73, respectively; in microcalcification-dominant cancers, the mean sensitivities were 80.0, 74.5, 80.0, and 78.2, respectively; however, there were no significant differences among them. Conclusion: High-contrast parameters tended to show relatively high sensitivity and A(Z) values in the detection of masses in dense breast tissue, but relatively low sensitivity for microcalcifications.</docText>

        <docText>Characterizing breast cancer xenograft epidermal growth factor receptor expression by using near-infrared optical imaging.

BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is associated with several key features of cancer development and growth. Therefore, EGFR is a very promising biological target for tumor diagnosis and anticancer therapy. Characterization of EGFR expression is important for clinicians to select patients for EGFR-targeted therapy and evaluate therapeutic effects. PURPOSE: To investigate whether near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye Cy5.5-labeled anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody Erbitux can characterize EGFR expression level in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts using an in vivo NIR imaging method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A fluorochrome probe was designed by coupling Cy5.5 to Erbitux through acidylation, and the fluorescence property of the Erbitux-Cy5.5 conjugate was characterized by fluorospectroscopy. Flow cytometry and laser confocal microscopy were used to test the EGFR specificity of the antibody probe in vitro. Erbitux-Cy5.5 was also injected intravenously into immune-deficient mice bearing MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 tumors. Whole-body and region-of-interest fluorescence images were acquired and analyzed. The EGFR expression was also analyzed and confirmed by immunohistochemical assay. RESULTS: The maximum excitation/emission wavelength for the Erbitux-Cy5.5 probe was 674/697 nm, similar to that of free Cy5.5 (674/712 nm). Confocal microscopy confirmed receptor-specific uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. In flow cytometry probe specificity assay, Erbitux-Cy5.5 showed a 9.32-fold higher affinity for MDA-MB-231 than MCF-7 cells. In vivo NIR imaging also indicated specific uptake in EGFR-positive tumors. Probe uptake rate and maximum intake dose in MDA-MB-231 were significantly higher than those in MCF-7 xenografts (P &lt; 0.001). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the in vivo imaging results, showing differentiated EGFR expression in MDA-MB-231 (+ + +) and MCF-7 (+) tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Erbitux-Cy5.5 may be used as a specific NIR contrast agent for the noninvasive characterization of EGFR expression level in breast cancer xenografts.</docText>

        <docText>In vitro and in vivo biological activity of PEDF against a range of tumors.

BACKGROUND: Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an emerging anti-cancer agent that targets both tumor tissue and its supporting vasculature. These direct and indirect effects of PEDF have been examined in vitro and in vivo for a range of malignancies. OBJECTIVE: This review seeks to present PEDF as a potential anti-cancer agent with applications across multiple malignancies. We refer closely to experimental methodology whilst still highlighting the clinical significance of PEDF in cancer, drawing on biological findings in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: A Pubmed database search was performed limiting the scope of this discussion paper mainly to PEDF's biological role in cancer, specifically lung, breast, prostatic, ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas, melanoma, glioma and osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: The biological roles of PEDF are diverse and multidimensional. As an anti-cancer agent, PEDF has great potential as a focused anti-neoplastic therapy against a variety of tumor types.</docText>

        <docText>Mansouramycins A-D, Cytotoxic Isoquinolinequinones from a Marine Streptomycete (1).

Chemical screening of the ethyl acetate extract from the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. isolate Mei37 resulted in five isoquinolinequinones, four new derivatives, mansouramycin A-D (1, 3-5), and the known 3-methyl-7-(methylamino)-5,8-isoquinolinedione (2). Their structures were elucidated by NMR and MS techniques and by comparison with related compounds. Cytotoxicity profiling of the mansouramycins in a panel of up to 36 tumor cell lines indicated significant cytotoxicity of several derivatives, with pronounced selectivity for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer cells.</docText>

        <docText>Combination Treatment with Luteolin and Quercetin Enhances Antiproliferative Effects in Nicotine-Treated MDA-MB-231 Cells by Down-regulating Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors.

Large-scale epidemiological cohort studies performed in the United States indicate that breast cancer risk is associated with active and passive smoking. As of yet, however, there is no direct evidence of antitumor effects by agents that block the effect of tobacco compound nicotine (Nic) on relevant nicotinic receptors (nAChR) involved in breast tumorigenesis. In the present study, the expression profiles of different nAChR subunits in the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) were characterized by RT-PCR. Nic (&gt;0.1 muM, 6 h) significantly increased alpha9-nAChR mRNA and protein expression levels in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). On the other hand, combined treatment with luteolin (Lut, 0.5 muM) and quercetin (Que, 0.5 muM) profoundly decreased MDA-MB-231 proliferation by down-regulating alpha9-nAChR expression. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in soft agar to evaluate anchorage-independent colony formation; combined treatment of Lut + Que inhibited Nic-induced MDA-MB-231 colony formation. Interestingly, the number of colonies formed was profoundly reduced in alpha9-nAChR knockdown (Si alpha9) cells in the combined (Lut + Que)-treated group as compared to the relevant control groups. Such results show that Lut- or Que-induced antitransforming activities were not limited to specific inhibition of the alpha9-nAChR receptor. Both alpha5- and alpha9-nAChR appear to be important molecular targets for Lut- and Que-induced antitumor effects in human breast cancer cells.</docText>

        <docTitle>Notch Promotes Radioresistance of Glioma Stem Cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Notch Promotes Radioresistance of Glioma Stem Cells.

Radiotherapy represents the most effective nonsurgical treatments for gliomas. Yet, gliomas are highly radioresistant and recurrence is nearly universal. Results from our laboratory and other groups suggest that cancer stem cells contribute to radioresistance in gliomas and breast cancers. The Notch pathway is critically implicated in stem cell fate determination and cancer. In this study, we show that inhibition of Notch pathway with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) rendered the glioma stem cells more sensitive to radiation at clinically relevant doses. GSIs enhanced radiation-induced cell death and impaired clonogenic survival of glioma stem cells, but not non-stem glioma cells. Expression of the constitutively active intracellular domains of Notch1 or Notch2 protected glioma stem cells against radiation. Notch inhibition with GSIs did not alter the DNA damage response of glioma stem cells following radiation, but rather reduced Akt activity and Mcl-1 levels. Finally, knockdown of Notch1 or Notch2 sensitizes glioma stem cells to radiation and impaired xenograft tumor formation. Taken together, our results suggest a critical role of Notch signaling to regulate radioresistance of glioma stem cells. Inhibition of Notch signaling holds promise to improve the efficiency of current radiotherapy in glioma treatment.</docText>

        <docText>In vitro cytotoxic effects of Senecio stabianus Lacaita (Asteraceae) on human cancer cell lines.

This study is aimed to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of Senecio stabianus Lacaita (Asteraceae) against renal adenocarcinoma ACHN, hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma LNCaP, amelanotic melanoma C32 and human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell lines. The n-hexane extract showed an interesting activity with IC(50) values of 62.7 and 71.1 microg mL(-1) against C32 and LNCaP, respectively. Two compounds identified in the n-hexane extract, linalool and beta-caryophyllene, were found to be active against C32 cells (IC(50) values of 23.2 and 20.1 microg mL(-1), respectively). Among tested constituents, the highest activity was found when alpha-humulene was applied to LNCaP cells (IC(50) of 11.2 microg mL(-1)). In order to complete the phytochemical study on S. stabianus, which has not been investigated previously, the most characteristic secondary metabolites of Senecio genus, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), were analysed. Here we report the isolation, structural elucidation and identification of nine PAs.</docText>

        <docText>Odontoid metastasis: a potential lethal complication.

Nearly one third of cervical spine metastasis has a primary breast malignancy. Patients with cervical metastasis have higher mortality due to advanced stage of the malignancy. Treatment is palliative to relieve pain, prevent pathological fracture, improve mobility and function, and prolong survival. We describe a 40-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who presented with neck and shoulder pain of 1 week duration with no neurological deficit. Following clinical examination, radiographs taken of the cervical spine was normal. Radiographs repeated 3 weeks later revealed a large lytic lesion of the odontoid occupying 70-80% of the peg. Further investigation including magnetic resonance imaging and bone scan showed no further spinal lesions. She underwent cyclical radiotherapy with complete resolution of the odontoid peg lesion and clinically was asymptomatic at 2 years. Metastatic lesions of the odontoid are atypical, and this case reinforces the necessity of early detection to evade disastrous consequences.</docText>

        <docText>Breastfeeding reduces breast cancer risk: a case-control study in Tunisia.

In this report, we examined the relationship between mother's breastfeeding history and her risk of breast cancer, in a case-control study in Tunisia between 2006 and 2009. About 400 breast cancer cases and 400 controls were included. Cases and controls were interviewed using a standardized structured questionnaire to obtain information on breastfeeding and other risk factors. Mean duration of breastfeeding per child was significantly associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer for women who breastfed for &gt;24 months per child. The OR was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.28-0.76) when compared those who breastfed for &lt;6 months. The test for trend was significant (p = 0.01). A significantly reduced risk of breast cancer was found for those whose lifetime duration of breastfeeding was 73-108 months (OR = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.36-1.18) and for those who breastfed for &gt;/=109 months (OR = 0.42, 95% CI, 0.20-0.84). Stratification by menopausal status showed a reduced risk of breast cancer associated with a longer duration of breastfeeding for both pre- and postmenopausal women. The risk reduction was more consistent for lifetime duration of breastfeeding, the test for trend being significant for both pre- (p = 0.03) and postmenopausal (p = 0.01) women. These results support an inverse association between breastfeeding and breast cancer risk.</docText>

        <docText>Pooled analysis indicates that the GSTT1 deletion, GSTM1 deletion, and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms do not modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.

The GSTP1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 detoxification genes all have functional polymorphisms that are common in the general population. A single study of 320 BRCA1/2 carriers previously assessed their effect in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. This study showed no evidence for altered risk of breast cancer for individuals with the GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion variants, but did report that the GSTP1 Ile105Val (rs1695) variant was associated with increased breast cancer risk in carriers. We investigated the association between these three GST polymorphisms and breast cancer risk using existing data from 718 women BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers from Australia, the UK, Canada, and the USA. Data were analyzed within a proportional hazards framework using Cox regression. There was no evidence to show that any of the polymorphisms modified disease risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers, and there was no evidence for heterogeneity between sites. These results support the need for replication studies to confirm or refute hypothesis-generating studies.</docText>

        <docTitle>Reciprocal regulation of ZEB1 and AR in triple negative breast cancer cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Reciprocal regulation of ZEB1 and AR in triple negative breast cancer cells.

Zinc-finger enhancer binding protein (ZEB1) is a transcription factor involved in the progression of cancer primarily through promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ZEB1 represses the expression of E-cadherin by binding to E-box sequences in the promoter, thus decreasing epithelial differentiation. We show that ZEB1 and androgen receptor (AR) cross-talk in triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that ZEB1 binds directly to the E-box located in the AR promoter. ZEB1 suppression by stably transfecting shRNA in a triple negative breast cancer cell line resulted in a decrease of AR mRNA, protein, and AR downstream targets. ZEB1 knockdown in triple negative breast cancer cells sensitized the cells to bicalutamide by reducing migration compared to the control cells. Conversely, blockade of AR signaling with bicalutamide resulted in a suppression of ZEB1 protein expression in two triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, using a breast cancer tissue microarray, a majority of triple negative breast cancers exhibit positive staining for both ZEB1 and AR. Taken together, these results indicate that ZEB1 and AR regulate each other to promote cell migration in triple negative breast cancer cells.</docText>

        <docTitle>Gene promoter methylation is associated with increased mortality among women with breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Gene promoter methylation is associated with increased mortality among women with breast cancer.

To better understand breast cancer etiology and progression, we explored the association between promoter methylation status of three breast cancer-related genes (BRCA1, APC, and p16) and survival in a large cohort of women with breast cancer. About 800 archived tumor tissues were collected from women diagnosed with a first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in 1996-1997. The vital status of the participants was followed through the end of year 2005 with a mean follow-up time of 8.0 years. Promoter methylation was assessed by methylation-specific PCR (for BRCA1) and MethyLight (for APC and p16). The association of promoter methylation and breast cancer mortality was evaluated by Cox-proportional hazards models. Methylated promoters were found in 59.0, 48.4, and 3.6% of the tumor samples for BRCA1, APC, and p16, respectively. Breast cancer-specific mortality was strongly associated with promoter methylation of p16 [HR and 95% CI: 3.53 (1.83-6.78)], whereas the associations with of BRCA1 and APC were less pronounced [HR and 95% CI: 1.81 (1.18-2.78) and 1.46 (0.98-2.17), respectively]. Similar associations were observed with all-cause mortality. As the number of methylated genes increased, the risk of breast cancer-specific mortality also increased in a dose-dependent manner (P, trend = 0.01). Importantly, even with our results stratified by hormone receptor status, promoter methylation of the three genes remained predictive of mortality. Our results suggest that promoter methylation could be promising epigenetic markers to be considered for breast cancer survival.</docText>

        <docText>A genetic variant in the pre-miR-27a oncogene is associated with a reduced familial breast cancer risk.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate pathways involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, development, and apoptosis by degradation of target mRNAs and/or repression of their translation. Although the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNAs target sites have been studied, the effects of SNPs in miRNAs are largely unknown. In our study, we first systematically sequenced miRNA genes reported to be involved in breast cancer to identify/verify SNPs. We analyzed four SNPs, one located in the pre-miRNA and the other three located in miRNA flanking regions, for a putative association with breast cancer risk. The SNP rs895819, located in the terminal loop of pre-miRNA-27a, showed a protective effect. In a large familial breast cancer study cohort, the rare [G] allele of rs895819 was found to be less frequent in the cases than in the controls, indicating a reduced familial breast cancer risk ([G] vs. [A]: OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99, P = 0.0287). Furthermore, age stratification revealed that the protective effect was mainly observed in the age group &lt; 50 years of age ([G] vs. [A]: OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P = 0.0314), whereas no significant effect was observed in the age group &gt;/= 50 years of age, indicating a possible hormone-related effect. It has been shown that artificial mutations in the terminal loop of miR-27a can block the maturation process of the miRNA. We hypothesize that the G-variant of rs895819 might impair the maturation of the oncogenic miR-27a and thus, is associated with familial breast cancer risk.</docText>

        <docText>Five common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PALB2 gene and susceptibility to breast cancer in eastern Chinese population.

Certain rare germline mutations in the PALB2 gene have been confirmed to increase susceptibility to breast cancer in diverse populations, but it has not been very clear that whether some common polymorphic variants in PALB2 also increase breast cancer risk. We conducted a case-control study to validate the association of common variations in the PALB2 gene and breast cancer in eastern Chinese population. A total of six common single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs8053188, rs16940342, rs249954, rs447529, rs249935, and rs3096145), which tagged the known common variants (minor allele frequency &gt;0.1) of PALB2, were genotyped among 660 cases and 756 cancer-free controls by SNPstream assay. Except rs3096145, other five SNPs passed the quality assessment criteria with genotyping call rate &gt;95%. Genotype and allele frequencies were statistically different between cases and controls for PALB2 rs447529 and rs249935. PALB2 rs249935 G allele was related to a 1.21-fold (95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.43) increase in risk for each 'A' allele carried (P = 0.029). Based on the dominant inheritance model tests, we found that compared with rs447529 CC homozygotes, the variant homozygote GG and heterozygote GC carriers had a 0.43-fold decreased risk of breast cancer (95% confidence interval = 0.24-0.78, P = 0.005). Combined with the results of the former study, our findings further verified that some common PALB2 polymorphisms may contribute to the etiology of breast cancer in Chinese women, so other large studies are warranted to confirm these observations in different ethnic populations.</docText>

        <docText>Importance of the development time of isolated bone metastasis in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate whether isolated bone metastases at the time of diagnosis is a different entity than bone metastases after breast cancer surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine patients were examined between June 2004 and January 2007. These patients were classified into synchronous (group I) and metachronous groups (group II) depending on time to development of bone metastases. Patients and tumor characteristics, treatment, clinical progression, and survival were compared for each group. RESULTS: There were 44 patients in group I and 95 patients in group II. The median follow-up time was 36 months. The two groups showed similar results when patients, tumor characteristics, and clinical progression were compared. In the groups, the median time to progression was 14 vs 13 months (p = 0.70), and median overall survival was 47 vs 46 months (p = 0.96), respectively. CONCLUSION: Development time of bone metastasis has no effect on clinical progression, time to progression, and overall survival in breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Worldwide first experiences with vacuum-assisted closure as alternative treatment method to repair defects of an extended thoracic wall recurrence of breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Loco-regional recurrences of the breast cancer are associated with a bad prognosis. Often costly autologous-tissue treatment as a surgery aiming at repairing the defects is necessary. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four female patients were treated with the vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)-system in context with the recurrence resection. In all cases a primary local masking was not possible. RESULTS: In the described cases the wounds healed well during the post-operative phase. There occurred no problems either during the radiation treatment or during chemotherapy in the case of lying VAC-Systems. CONCLUSION: Using vacuum-assisted wound closure one can avoid autologous-tissue treatment in the case of extensive loco-regional recurrences.</docText>

        <docText>Management of advanced breast cancer with the epothilone B analog, ixabepilone.

Despite the activity of standard chemotherapies in advanced breast cancer, disease progression remains inevitable. Most patients exposed to anthracyclines and taxanes develop resistance and a significant subset shows primary resistance. The increasing use of these agents as adjuvant therapy may result in more anthracycline- and taxane-resistant patients in the metastatic setting; few treatment options are available for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) resistant to multiple chemotherapies. The heterogeneity of breast cancer represents another therapeutic challenge. Breast cancers may be classified as luminal, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive, or estrogen receptor-, progesterone receptor-, and human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (ER/PR/HER2-negative, triple negative). HER2-positive and ER/PR/HER2-negative tumors are associated with poor prognosis owing to aggressive disease and poor long-term response to therapy. The epothilone B analog ixabepilone has low susceptibility to multiple mechanisms of resistance and has demonstrated activity in patients with MBC resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and/or capecitabine. Ixabepilone is the first epothilone to be approved, as monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine, for treatment of resistant/refractory MBC or locally advanced breast cancer. Treatment with ixabepilone is an option for patients with ER/PR/HER2-negative or HER2-positive disease and/or primary resistance to taxanes.</docText>

        <docText>Troglitazone reverses the multiple drug resistance phenotype in cancer cells.

A major problem in treating cancer is the development of drug resistance. We previously demonstrated doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in K562 human leukemia cells that was associated with upregulation of glyoxalase 1 (GLO-1) and histone H3 expression. The thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRG) downregulated GLO-1 expression and further upregulated histone H3 expression and post-translational modifications in these cells, leading to a regained sensitivity to DOX. Given the pleiotropic effects of epigenetic changes in cancer development, we hypothesized that TRG may downregulate the multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype in a variety of cancer cells. To test this, MCF7 human breast cancer cells and K562 cells were cultured in the presence of low-dose DOX to establish DOX-resistant cell lines (K562/DOX and MCF7/DOX). The MDR phenotype was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (Pgp) drug efflux pump multiple drug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1), and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). TRG markedly decreased expression of both MDR-1 and BCRP in these cells, resulting in sensitivity to DOX. Silencing of MDR-1 expression also sensitized MCF7/DOX cells to DOX. Use of the specific and irreversible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) inhibitor GW9662 in the nanomolar range not only demonstrated that the action of TRG on MCF/DOX was PPARgamma-independent, but indicated that PPARgamma may play a role in the MDR phenotype, which is antagonized by TRG. We conclude that TRG is potentially a useful adjunct therapy in chemoresistant cancers.</docText>

        <docText>Bisphosphonates in oncology: evidence for the prevention of skeletal events in patients with bone metastases.

Bone metastases frequently occur in patients with advanced solid tumors, particularly breast and prostate cancers, and nearly all patients with multiple myeloma have some degree of skeletal involvement. The strides made in treating these primary tumors have extended median survival times and thereby increased patient risk for skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, need for palliative radiation therapy or surgery to bone, and hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates, inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption that were first established as treatment of osteoporosis, have been shown to prevent and/or delay SREs related to malignancy. The results of a large, randomized phase 3 study comparing zoledronic acid and pamidronate in breast cancer or multiple myeloma patients with osteolytic lesions showed that the incidence of SREs, time to first SRE, and risk of developing a SRE were similar between treatment groups. However, in patients with solid tumors (excluding breast or prostate cancer) metastatic to the bone, only zoledronic acid has demonstrated clinical efficacy. Although bone turnover marker levels, such as N-telopeptide of type I collagen, have been shown to correlate with clinical response, additional studies are needed to validate their ability to predict response to bisphosphonate therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Tight junctions: a barrier to the initiation and progression of breast cancer?

Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease that arises from epithelial cells lining the breast ducts and lobules. Correct adhesion between adjacent epithelial cells is important in determining the normal structure and function of epithelial tissues, and there is accumulating evidence that dysregulated cell-cell adhesion is associated with many cancers. This review will focus on one cell-cell adhesion complex, the tight junction (TJ), and summarize recent evidence that TJs may participate in breast cancer development or progression. We will first outline the protein composition of TJs and discuss the functions of the TJ complex. Secondly we will examine how alterations in these functions might facilitate breast cancer initiation or progression; by focussing on the regulatory influence of TJs on cell polarity, cell fate and cell migration. Finally we will outline how pharmacological targeting of TJ proteins may be useful in limiting breast cancer progression. Overall we hope to illustrate that the relationship between TJ alterations and breast cancer is a complex one; but that this area offers promise in uncovering fundamental mechanisms linked to breast cancer progression.</docText>

        <docText>Cathepsin G, a neutrophil protease, induces compact cell-cell adhesion in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.

Cathepsin G is a serine protease secreted by activated neutrophils that play a role in the inflammatory response. Because neutrophils are known to be invading leukocytes in various tumors, their products may influence the characteristics of tumor cells such as the growth state, motility, and the adhesiveness between cells or the extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that cathepsin G induces cell-cell adhesion of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells resulting from the contact inhibition of cell movement on fibronectin but not on type IV collagen. Cathepsin G subsequently induced cell condensation, a very compact cell colony, resulting due to the increased strength of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Cathepsin G action is protease activity-dependent and was inhibited by the presence of serine protease inhibitors. Cathepsin G promotes E-cadherin/catenin complex formation and Rap1 activation in MCF-7 cells, which reportedly regulates E-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions. Cathepsin G also promotes E-cadherin/protein kinase D1 (PKD1) complex formation, and Go6976, the selective PKD1 inhibitor, suppressed the cathepsin G-induced cell condensation. Our findings provide the first evidence that cathepsin G regulates E-cadherin function, suggesting that cathepsin G has a novel modulatory role against tumor cell-cell adhesion.</docText>

        <docText>Relation of risk of contralateral breast cancer to the interval since the first primary tumour.

Background:There is no consensus on how to separate contralateral breast cancer (CBC) occurring as distant spread of the primary breast cancer (BC) from an independent CBC.Methods:We used standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) to analyse the variations in the risk of CBC over time among 6629 women with BC diagnosed between 1954 and 1983. To explore the most appropriate cutoff to separate the two types of CBC, we analysed the deviance between models including different cutoff points as compared with the basal model with no cutoff date. We also performed a prognostic study through a Cox model.Results:The SIR was much higher during the first 2 years of follow-up than afterwards. The best cutoff appeared to be 2 years. The risk of early CBC was linked to tumour spread and the risk of late CBC was linked to age and to the size of the tumour. Radiotherapy was not selected by the model either for early or late CBC risk.Conclusion:A clearer pattern of CBC risk might appear if studies used a similar cutoff time after the initial BC.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605434 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>Improving outcome of chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer by docosahexaenoic acid: a phase II trial.

Background:Breast cancer becomes lethal when visceral metastases develop. At this stage, anti-cancer treatments aim at relieving symptoms and delaying death without resulting in additional toxicity. On the basis of their differential anti-oxidant defence level, tumour cells can be made more sensitive to chemotherapy than non-tumour cells when membrane lipids are enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a peroxidisable and oxidative-stress-inducing lipid of marine origin.Methods:This open-label single-arm phase II study evaluated the safety and efficacy (response rate), as primary end points, of the addition of 1.8 g DHA daily to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy (FEC) regimen in breast cancer patients (n=25) with rapidly progressing visceral metastases. The secondary end points were time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).Results:The objective response rate was 44%. With a mean follow-up time of 31 months (range 2-96 months), the median TTP was 6 months. Median OS was 22 months and reached 34 months in the sub-population of patients (n=12) with the highest plasma DHA incorporation. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was neutropaenia (80%).Conclusion:DHA during chemotherapy was devoid of adverse side effects and can improve the outcome of chemotherapy when highly incorporated. DHA has a potential to specifically chemosensitise tumours.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605441 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluation of a candidate breast cancer associated SNP in ERCC4 as a risk modifier in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Results from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/BRCA2 (CIMBA).

Background:In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of a SNP in intron 1 of the ERCC4 gene (rs744154), previously reported to be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in the general population, as a breast cancer risk modifier in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.Methods:We have genotyped rs744154 in 9408 BRCA1 and 5632 BRCA2 mutation carriers from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) and assessed its association with breast cancer risk using a retrospective weighted cohort approach.Results:We found no evidence of association with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 (per-allele HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.93-1.04, P=0.5) or BRCA2 (per-allele HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89-1.06, P=0.5) mutation carriers.Conclusion:This SNP is not a significant modifier of breast cancer risk for mutation carriers, though weak associations cannot be ruled out.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605416 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>Assessment of residual tumour by FDG-PET: conventional imaging and clinical examination following primary chemotherapy of large and locally advanced breast cancer.

Background:The aim of this was to evaluate FDG-PET (2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography) for assessment of residual tumour after primary chemotherapy of large and locally advanced breast cancer in comparison with conventional imaging modalities.Methods:In a prospective multicentre trial, 99 patients underwent one or more breast imaging modalities before surgery in addition to clinical examination, namely, FDG-PET (n=89), mammography (n=47), ultrasound (n=46), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=46). The presence of residual tumour by conventional imaging, dichotomised as positive or negative, and the level of FDG uptake (standardised uptake values, SUV) were compared with histopathology, which served as the reference standard. Patients with no residual tumour or only small microscopic foci of residual tumour were classified as having minimal residual disease and those with extensive microscopic and macroscopic residual tumour tissue were classified as having gross residual disease.Results:By applying a threshold SUV of 2.0, the sensitivity of FDG-PET for residual tumour was 32.9% (specificity, 87.5%) and increased to 57.5% (specificity, 62.5%) at a threshold SUV of 1.5. Conventional imaging modalities were more sensitive in identifying residual tumour, but had a low corresponding specificity; sensitivity and specificity were as follows: MRI 97.6 and 40.0%, mammography 92.5 and 57.1%, ultrasound 92.0 and 37.5%, respectively. Breast MRI provided the highest accuracy (91.3%), whereas FDG-PET had the lowest accuracy (42.7%).Conclusions:FDG-PET does not provide an accurate assessment of residual tumour after primary chemotherapy of breast cancer.

        <docText>A case of premenopausal metastatic breast cancer treated with goserelin plus aromatase inhibitor as second-line endocrine therapy.

A 4 4-year-old female with premenopausal advanced breast cancer had been treated with a combination of LH-RH analogue and tamoxifen as primary endocrine therapy following adjuvant chemotherapy. Forty-seven months after operation, because metastases of contralateral axillary lymph nodes were detected by computer tomography, she was treated with a combination of LH-RH analogue and aromatase inhibitor as second-line endocrine therapy. During the 16-month administration of LH-RH analogue and aromatase inhibitor, she was been well without new metastatic lesions and maintained a high quality of life.</docText>

        <docText>Effects of mammography screening under different screening schedules: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.

BACKGROUND: Despite trials of mammography and widespread use, optimal screening policy is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate U.S. breast cancer screening strategies. DESIGN: 6 models using common data elements. DATA SOURCES: National data on age-specific incidence, competing mortality, mammography characteristics, and treatment effects. TARGET POPULATION: A contemporary population cohort. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: 20 screening strategies with varying initiation and cessation ages applied annually or biennially. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of mammograms, reduction in deaths from breast cancer or life-years gained (vs. no screening), false-positive results, unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The 6 models produced consistent rankings of screening strategies. Screening biennially maintained an average of 81% (range across strategies and models, 67% to 99%) of the benefit of annual screening with almost half the number of false-positive results. Screening biennially from ages 50 to 69 years achieved a median 16.5% (range, 15% to 23%) reduction in breast cancer deaths versus no screening. Initiating biennial screening at age 40 years (vs. 50 years) reduced mortality by an additional 3% (range, 1% to 6%), consumed more resources, and yielded more false-positive results. Biennial screening after age 69 years yielded some additional mortality reduction in all models, but overdiagnosis increased most substantially at older ages. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Varying test sensitivity or treatment patterns did not change conclusions. LIMITATION: Results do not include morbidity from false-positive results, patient knowledge of earlier diagnosis, or unnecessary treatment. CONCLUSION: Biennial screening achieves most of the benefit of annual screening with less harm. Decisions about the best strategy depend on program and individual objectives and the weight placed on benefits, harms, and resource considerations.

        <docText>Screening for breast cancer: an update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

BACKGROUND: This systematic review is an update of evidence since the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on breast cancer screening. PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of mammography screening in decreasing breast cancer mortality among average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years and 70 years or older, the effectiveness of clinical breast examination and breast self-examination, and the harms of screening. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter of 2008), MEDLINE (January 2001 to December 2008), reference lists, and Web of Science searches for published studies and Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium for screening mammography data. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials with breast cancer mortality outcomes for screening effectiveness, and studies of various designs and multiple data sources for harms. DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data were abstracted, and study quality was rated by using established criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% for women aged 39 to 49 years (relative risk, 0.85 [95% credible interval, 0.75 to 0.96]; 8 trials). Data are lacking for women aged 70 years or older. Radiation exposure from mammography is low. Patient adverse experiences are common and transient and do not affect screening practices. Estimates of overdiagnosis vary from 1% to 10%. Younger women have more false-positive mammography results and additional imaging but fewer biopsies than older women. Trials of clinical breast examination are ongoing; trials for breast self-examination showed no reductions in mortality but increases in benign biopsy results. Limitation: Studies of older women, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging are lacking. CONCLUSION: Mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality for women aged 39 to 69 years; data are insufficient for older women. False-positive mammography results and additional imaging are common. No benefit has been shown for clinical breast examination or breast self-examination.</docText>

        <docText>Screening for breast cancer: u.s. Preventive services task force recommendation statement.

DESCRIPTION: Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population. METHODS: The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer.

        <docTitle>Systematic review: comparative effectiveness of medications to reduce risk for primary breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Systematic review: comparative effectiveness of medications to reduce risk for primary breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Trials demonstrate the efficacy of medications to reduce the risk for invasive breast cancer. PURPOSE: To summarize benefits and harms of tamoxifen citrate, raloxifene, and tibolone to reduce the risk for primary breast cancer. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases from inception to January 2009, Web of Science, trial registries, and manufacturer information. STUDY SELECTION: Predefined eligibility criteria were used to select articles. English-language reports of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) for benefits and RCTs and observational studies for harms were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers assessed study data, quality, and applicability. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 head-to-head trial provide results for main outcomes. Tamoxifen (risk ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82]; 4 trials), raloxifene (risk ratio, 0.44 [CI, 0.27 to 0.71]; 2 trials), and tibolone (risk ratio, 0.32 [CI, 0.13 to 0.80]; 1 trial) reduce risk for invasive breast cancer compared with placebo by 7 to 10 per 1000 women per year. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer but not estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, noninvasive breast cancer, or mortality. All medications reduce fractures. Tamoxifen (risk ratio, 1.93 [CI, 1.41 to 2.64]; 4 trials) and raloxifene (risk ratio, 1.60 [CI, 1.15 to 2.23]; 2 trials) increase thromboembolic events by 4 to 7 per 1000 women per year; raloxifene causes fewer events than tamoxifen. Tamoxifen increases risk for endometrial cancer (risk ratio, 2.13 [CI, 1.36 to 3.32]; 3 trials) compared with placebo by 4 per 1000 women per year and causes cataracts compared with raloxifene. Tibolone causes strokes in older women. LIMITATIONS: Bias, trial heterogeneity, and a dearth of head-to-head trials limit this review. Data are lacking on doses, duration, and timing of the medications; long-term effects; and nonwhite and premenopausal women. CONCLUSION: Three medications reduce risk for primary breast cancer but increase risk for thromboembolic events (tamoxifen, raloxifene), endometrial cancer (tamoxifen), or stroke (tibolone).</docText>

        <docTitle>Inhibition of the p38 Kinase Suppresses the Proliferation of Human ER-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Inhibition of the p38 Kinase Suppresses the Proliferation of Human ER-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.

p38 kinases are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family that transduce signals from various environmental stresses, growth factors, and steroid hormones. p38 is highly expressed in aggressive and invasive breast cancers. Increased levels of activated p38 are markers of poor prognosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of p38 signaling would inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. We studied breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation upon p38 blockade by using three independent approaches: dominant-negative (DN) constructs, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and small molecule inhibitors. p38alpha and p38delta are the most abundant isoforms expressed by all examined human breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines. Expression of a DN p38 inhibited both anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells. Silencing of p38alpha, but not p38delta, using siRNA suppressed MDA-MB-468 cell proliferation. Pharmacologic inhibitors of p38 significantly inhibited the proliferation of p53 mutant and ER-negative breast cancer cells. Whereas p38 has previously been considered as a mediator of stress-induced apoptosis, we propose that p38 may have dual activities regulating survival and proliferation depending on the expression of p53. Our data suggest that p38 mediates the proliferation signal in breast cancer cells expressing mutant but not wild-type p53. Because most ER-negative breast tumors express mutant p53, our results provide the foundation for future development of p38 inhibitors to target p38 for the treatment of p53 mutant and ER-negative breast cancers.

        <docText>Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Homing to Pulmonary Metastases Using Biocompatible Magnetic Nanoparticles.

The ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to specifically home to tumors has suggested their potential use as a delivery vehicle for cancer therapeutics. MSC integration into tumors has been shown in animal models using histopathologic techniques after animal sacrifice. Tracking the delivery and engraftment of MSCs into human tumors will need in vivo imaging techniques. We hypothesized that labeling MSCs with iron oxide nanoparticles would enable in vivo tracking with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Human MSCs were labeled in vitro with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, with no effect on differentiation potential, proliferation, survival, or migration of the cells. In initial experiments, we showed that as few as 1,000 MSCs carrying iron oxide nanoparticles can be detected by MRI one month after their coinjection with breast cancer cells that formed subcutaneous tumors. Subsequently, we show that i.v.- injected iron-labeled MSCs could be tracked in vivo to multiple lung metastases using MRI, observations that were confirmed histologically. This is the first study to use MRI to track MSCs to lung metastases in vivo. This technique has the potential to show MSC integration into human tumors, allowing early-phase clinical studies examining MSC homing in patients with metastatic tumors.

        <docTitle>Radioimmunotherapy of Breast Cancer Metastases with {alpha}-Particle Emitter 225Ac: Comparing Efficacy with 213Bi and 90Y.</docTitle>
        <docText>Radioimmunotherapy of Breast Cancer Metastases with {alpha}-Particle Emitter 225Ac: Comparing Efficacy with 213Bi and 90Y.

alpha-Particles are suitable to treat cancer micrometastases because of their short range and very high linear energy transfer. alpha-Particle emitter (213)Bi-based radioimmunotherapy has shown efficacy in a variety of metastatic animal cancer models, such as breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Its clinical implementation, however, is challenging due to the limited supply of (225)Ac, high technical requirement to prepare radioimmunoconjugate with very short half-life (T(1/2) = 45.6 min) on site, and prohibitive cost. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of the alpha-particle emitter (225)Ac, parent of (213)Bi, in a mouse model of breast cancer metastases. A single administration of (225)Ac (400 nCi)-labeled anti-rat HER-2/neu monoclonal antibody (7.16.4) completely eradicated breast cancer lung micrometastases in approximately 67% of HER-2/neu transgenic mice and led to long-term survival of these mice for up to 1 year. Treatment with (225)Ac-7.16.4 is significantly more effective than (213)Bi-7.16.4 (120 muCi; median survival, 61 days; P = 0.001) and (90)Y-7.16.4 (120 muCi; median survival, 50 days; P &lt; 0.001) as well as untreated control (median survival, 41 days; P &lt; 0.0001). Dosimetric analysis showed that (225)Ac-treated metastases received a total dose of 9.6 Gy, significantly higher than 2.0 Gy from (213)Bi and 2.4 Gy from (90)Y. Biodistribution studies revealed that (225)Ac daughters, (221)Fr and (213)Bi, accumulated in kidneys and probably contributed to the long-term renal toxicity observed in surviving mice. These data suggest (225)Ac-labeled anti-HER-2/neu monoclonal antibody could significantly prolong survival in HER-2/neu-positive metastatic breast cancer patients.

        <docTitle>Positive Cross-Talk between Estrogen Receptor and NF-{kappa}B in Breast Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Positive Cross-Talk between Estrogen Receptor and NF-{kappa}B in Breast Cancer.

Estrogen receptors (ER) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) are known to play important roles in breast cancer, but these factors are generally thought to repress each other's activity. However, we have recently found that ER and NF-kappaB can also act together in a positive manner to synergistically increase gene transcription. To examine the extent of cross-talk between ER and NF-kappaB, a microarray study was conducted in which MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), or both. Follow-up studies with an ER antagonist and NF-kappaB inhibitors show that cross-talk between E(2) and TNFalpha is mediated by these two factors. We find that although transrepression between ER and NF-kappaB does occur, positive cross-talk is more prominent with three gene-specific patterns of regulation: (a) TNFalpha enhances E(2) action on approximately 30% of E(2)-upregulated genes; (b) E(2) enhances TNFalpha activity on approximately 15% of TNFalpha-upregulated genes; and (c) E(2) + TNFalpha causes a more than additive upregulation of approximately 60 genes. Consistent with their prosurvival roles, ER and NF-kappaB and their target gene, BIRC3, are involved in protecting breast cancer cells against apoptosis. Furthermore, genes positively regulated by E(2) + TNFalpha are clinically relevant because they are enriched in luminal B breast tumors and their expression profiles can distinguish a cohort of patients with poor outcome following endocrine treatment. Taken together, our findings suggest that positive cross-talk between ER and NF-kappaB is more extensive than anticipated and that these factors may act together to promote survival of breast cancer cells and progression to a more aggressive phenotype.

        <docText>Fibroblast Hepatocyte Growth Factor Promotes Invasion of Human Mammary Ductal Carcinoma In situ.

Stromal-derived hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) acting through its specific proto-oncogene receptor c-Met has been suggested to play a paracrine role in the regulation of tumor cell migration and invasion. The transition from preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast carcinoma is marked by infiltration of stromal fibroblasts and the loss of basement membrane. We hypothesized that HGF produced by the infiltrating fibroblasts may alter proteolytic pathways in DCIS cells, and, to study this hypothesis, established three-dimensional reconstituted basement membrane overlay cocultures with two human DCIS cell lines, MCF10.DCIS and SUM102. Both cell lines formed large dysplastic structures in three-dimensional cultures that resembled DCIS in vivo and occasionally developed invasive outgrowths. In coculture with HGF-secreting mammary fibroblasts, the percentage of DCIS structures with invasive outgrowths was increased. Activation of c-Met with conditioned medium from HGF-secreting fibroblasts or with recombinant HGF increased the percentage of DCIS structures with invasive outgrowths, their degradation of collagen IV, and their secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor. In agreement with the in vitro findings, coinjection with HGF-secreting fibroblasts increased invasiveness of MCF10.DCIS xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Our study shows that paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling between fibroblasts and preinvasive DCIS cells enhances the transition to invasive carcinomas and suggests that three-dimensional cocultures are appropriate models for testing therapeutics that target tumor microenvironment-enhanced invasiveness.

        <docText>Hypoxia Regulates Insulin Receptor Substrate-2 Expression to Promote Breast Carcinoma Cell Survival and Invasion.

Insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) belongs to the IRS family of adaptor proteins that function as signaling intermediates for growth factor, cytokine, and integrin receptors, many of which have been implicated in cancer. Although the IRS proteins share significant homology, distinct functions have been attributed to each family member in both normal and tumor cells. In cancer, IRS-2 is positively associated with aggressive tumor behavior. In the current study, we show that IRS-2 expression, but not IRS-1 expression, is positively regulated by hypoxia, which selects for tumor cells with increased metastatic potential. We identify IRS-2 as a novel hypoxia-responsive gene and establish that IRS-2 gene transcription increases in a hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent manner in hypoxic environments. IRS-2 is active to mediate insulin-like growth factor I-dependent signals in hypoxia, and enhanced activation of Akt in hypoxia is dependent on IRS-2 expression. Functionally, the elevated expression of IRS-2 facilitates breast carcinoma cell survival and invasion in hypoxia. Collectively, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which IRS-2 contributes to the aggressive behavior of hypoxic tumor cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):8894-8901].</docText>

        <docText>Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling Pathway Regulates Breast Cancer Cell Migration by Maintaining slug Expression.

Cell migration is a critical step in cancer cell invasion. Recent studies have implicated the importance of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in cancer cell migration. However, the mechanism associated with ERK-regulated cell migration is poorly understood. Using a panel of breast cancer cell lines, we detected an excellent correlation between ERK activity and cell migration. Interestingly, we noticed that a 48-hour treatment with U0126 [specific mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK)-1/2 inhibitor] was needed to significantly inhibit breast cancer cell migration, whereas this inhibitor blocked ERK activity within 1 hour. This observation suggests that ERK-dependent gene expression, rather than direct ERK signaling, is essential for cell migration. With further study, we found that ERK activity promoted the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP1) components Fra-1 and c-Jun, both of which were necessary for cell migration. Combination of U0126 treatment and Fra-1/c-Jun knockdown did not yield further reduction in cell migration than either alone, indicating that ERKs and Fra-1/c-Jun act by the same mechanism to facilitate cell migration. In an attempt to investigate the role of Fra-1/c-Jun in cell migration, we found that the ERK-Fra-1/c-Jun axis regulated slug expression in an AP1-dependent manner. Moreover, the occurrence of U0126-induced migratory inhibition coincided with slug reduction, and silencing slug expression abrogated breast cancer cell migration. These results suggest an association between ERK-regulated cell migration and slug expression. Indeed, cell migration was not significantly inhibited by U0126 treatment or Fra-1/c-Jun silencing in cells expressing slug transgene. Our study suggests that the ERK pathway regulates breast cancer cell migration by maintaining slug expression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):OF1-8].</docText>

        <docTitle>Protein Kinase A Activation Confers Resistance to Trastuzumab in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines.</docTitle>
        <docText>Protein Kinase A Activation Confers Resistance to Trastuzumab in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines.

PURPOSE: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted to the Her2 receptor and approved for treatment of Her2-positive breast cancer. Among patients who initially respond to trastuzumab therapy, resistance typically arises within 1 year. BT/Her(R) cells are trastuzumab-resistant variants of Her2-positive BT474 breast cancer cells. The salient feature of BT/Her(R) cells is failure to downregulate phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling on trastuzumab binding. The current work addresses the mechanism of sustained signaling in BT/Her(R) cells, focusing on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed microarray analysis on BT/Her(R) and BT474 cell lines to identify genes that were upregulated or downregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells. Specific genes in the PKA pathway were quantified using reverse transcription-PCR and Western hybridization. Small interfering RNA transfection was used to determine the effects of gene knockdown on cellular response to trastuzumab. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to measure cyclic AMP-responsive element binding activity under defined conditions. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze protein expression in clinical samples. RESULTS: BT/Her(R) cells had elevated PKA signaling activity and several genes in the PKA regulatory network had altered expression in these cells. Downregulation of one such gene, the PKA-RIIalpha regulatory subunit, conferred partial trastuzumab resistance in Her2-positive BT474 and SK-Br-3 cell lines. Forskolin activation of PKA also produced significant protection against trastuzumab-mediated Akt dephosphorylation. In patient samples, PKA signaling appeared to be enhanced in residual disease remaining after trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PKA signaling may be one mechanism contributing to trastuzumab resistance in Her2-positive breast cancer. We propose a molecular model by which PKA confers its effects.

        <docText>Pharmacologically Increased Tumor Hypoxia Can Be Measured by 18F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside Positron Emission Tomography and Enhances Tumor Response to Hypoxic Cytotoxin PR-104.

PURPOSE: Solid tumors contain microenvironmental regions of hypoxia that present a barrier to traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and this work describes a novel approach to circumvent hypoxia. We propose to overcome hypoxia by augmenting the effectiveness of drugs that are designed to specifically kill hypoxic tumor cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have constructed RKO colorectal tumor cells that express a small RNA hairpin that specifically knocks down the hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) transcription factor. We have used these cells in vitro to determine the effect of HIF1 on cellular sensitivity to the hypoxic cytotoxin PR-104, and its role in cellular oxygen consumption in response to the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). We have further used these cells in vivo in xenografted tumors to determine the role of HIF1 in regulating tumor hypoxia in response to DCA using (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography, and its role in regulating tumor sensitivity to the combination of DCA and PR-104. RESULTS: HIF1 does not affect cellular sensitivity to PR-104 in vitro. DCA transiently increases cellular oxygen consumption in vitro and increases the extent of tumor hypoxia in vivo as measured with (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography. Furthermore, we show that DCA-dependent alterations in hypoxia increase the antitumor activity of the next-generation hypoxic cytotoxin PR-104. CONCLUSIONS: DCA interferes with the HIF-dependent "adaptive response," which limits mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This approach transiently increases tumor hypoxia and represents an important method to improve antitumor efficacy of hypoxia-targeted agents, without increasing toxicity to oxygenated normal tissue.

        <docText>Loss of HER2 Amplification Following Trastuzumab-Based Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy and Survival Outcomes.

PURPOSE: To evaluate HER2 status in residual tumor identified at the time of surgery in patients not achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) and to determine the effect of alterations in HER2 status on recurrence-free survival (RFS). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clinicopathologic data for patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy with a taxane, anthracycline, and concomitant trastuzumab between 2004 and 2007 were reviewed. Surgical specimens for patients achieving less than a pCR were assessed to determine if there was enough residual tissue to evaluate posttreatment HER2 status. RFS was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank statistic. RESULTS: A pCR was achieved in 72 of the 142 (50.7%) patients. Residual tumor was sufficient to assess posttreatment HER2 status in 25 patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization done on pretreatment specimens confirmed HER2 amplification before beginning therapy. Eight (32.0%) posttreatment tumors were found to be HER2-negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization. At a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 8-56 months), the RFS was significantly better for patients with tumors that retained HER2 amplification (87.5% versus 50%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: High pCR rates are achieved in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab in combination with anthracyclines and taxanes. One third of patients with significant residual disease loses HER2 amplification, and this change is associated with poor RFS. Residual tumor identified at the time of surgery should be reassessed for HER2 status, and novel adjuvant therapy strategies need to be studied in this population.

        <docText>Preoperative assessment of HER-2/neu status in breast carcinoma: The role of quantitative real-time PCR on core-biopsy specimens.

OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of HER-2/neu status is mandatory to identify breast cancer patients amenable to trastuzumab treatment. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the preoperative determination of HER-2/neu status in breast cancer, using core biopsy material. METHODS: In a prospective series, qRT-PCR was performed on fresh core biopsy specimens taken preoperatively in 87 patients with breast carcinoma. Cases with qRT-PCR ratio &gt;/=2.0 were considered to have HER-2/neu amplification. The results of RT-PCR analysis were compared with those of the standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods. Cases with IHC 3+ or with IHC 2+ and FISH showing amplification were considered HER-2/neu positive. All other cases were considered HER-2/neu negative. RESULTS: qRT-PCR showed HER-2/neu amplification in 13 cases (14.9%), while the standard IHC-FISH combined approach identified 17 HER-2/neu-positive cases (19.5%). Overall, there was concordance between methods in 83 of 87 patients (95.4%). The Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was 0.851; p&lt;0.001. The diagnostic performance for preoperative diagnosis of HER-2/neu status using RT-PCR on core biopsy specimens as compared to standard approach was as follows: sensitivity 76.5%; specificity 100%; positive predictive value 100%; negative predictive value 94.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative RT-PCR determination of HER-2/neu status from core biopsy specimens provided results comparable to those given by the standard IHC and FISH methods. The use of qRT-PCR on core biopsy material may represent a very useful and easy tool to enhance early identification of HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer patients who, possibly can benefit from trastuzumab treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in circulating tumor cells of breast cancer patients.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The detection of peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and bone marrow disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in breast cancer patients is associated with a high incidence of disease relapse and disease-related death. Since hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play an important role in angiogenesis and tumor progression, the purpose of the current study was to investigate their expression in CTCs. METHODS: The expression of cytokeratins (CK), VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), HIF-1 alpha and phosphorylated-focal adhesion kinase (pFAK) in CTCs from 34 patients with metastatic breast cancer who had detectable CK-19 mRNA-positive CTCs was assessed using double staining experiments and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with a monoclonal A45-B/B3 pancytokeratin antibody in combination with either VEGF or VEGFR2 or HIF-1 alpha or pFAK antibodies, respectively. RESULTS: pFAK expression in CTCs was detected in 92% of patients whereas expression of VEGF, VEGFR2 and HIF-1 alpha was observed in 62%, 47% and 76% of patients, respectively. VEGF, VEGFR2, HIF-1 alpha and pFAK were expressed in 73%, 71%, 56% and 81%, respectively, of all the detected CTCs. VEGF mRNA was also detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in immunomagnetically-separated CTCs. Double and triple staining experiments in cytospins of immunomagnetically-isolated CTCs showed that VEGF co-expressed with HIF-1 alpha and VEGFR2. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of pFAK, HIF-1 alpha, VEGF and VEGFR2 in CTCs of patients with metastatic breast cancer could explain the metastatic potential of these cells and may provide a therapeutic target for their elimination.</docText>

        <docText>Effects of endogenous insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 on cell cycle regulation in breast cancer cells.

High tissue insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) expression in breast cancers is associated in some studies with rapid growth and poor outcome. This study examined the effects of endogenous IGFBP-3 in Hs578T breast cancer cells, which are IGF-unresponsive and grow aggressively despite relatively high IGFBP-3 expression. IGFBP-3 downregulation using siRNA was associated with increases in DNA synthesis, the percentage of cells in S phase and viable cell numbers, accompanied by increases in cyclins A and D1, a decrease in p27 expression, and increased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) on Ser795. Downregulation of IGFBP-3 inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and cell migration in a monolayer wound healing assay. These results indicate that endogenous IGFBP-3 is anti-proliferative and pro-migratory in Hs578T cells and that these effects are IGF-independent. Poor outcome in breast tumours expressing high levels of IGFBP-3 may be due to the effects of IGFBP-3 on cell migration rather than cell growth.</docText>

        <docText>Tamoxifen-Poly(ethylene glycol)-Thiol Gold Nanoparticle Conjugates: Enhanced Potency and Selective Delivery for Breast Cancer Treatment.

The breast cancer treatment drug tamoxifen has been widely administered for more than three decades. This small molecule competes with 17beta-estradiol for binding to estrogen receptor, a hormone receptor upregulated in a majority of breast cancers, subsequently initiating programmed cell death. We have synthesized a thiol-PEGylated tamoxifen derivative that can be used to selectively target and deliver plasmonic gold nanoparticles to estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells with up to 2.7-fold enhanced drug potency in vitro. Optical microscopy/spectroscopy, time-dependent dose-response data, and estrogen competition studies indicate that augmented activity is due to increased rates of intracellular tamoxifen transport by nanoparticle endocytosis, rather than by passive diffusion of the free drug. Both ligand- and receptor-dependent intracellular delivery of gold nanoparticles suggest that plasma membrane localized estrogen receptor alpha may facilitate selective uptake and retention of this and other therapeutic nanoparticle conjugates. Combined targeting selectivity and enhanced potency provides opportunities for both multimodal endocrine treatment strategies and adjunctive laser photothermal therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluation of the Fertility and Cancer Project (FCP) among young breast cancer survivors.

Objective: Fertility and childbearing issues are the major quality of life concerns among young breast cancer survivors. Practical approaches are needed to convey reproductive health information. The Fertility and Cancer Project (FCP) is a dedicated research project that provides online reproductive health and fertility education. We report FCP participants' (a) changes in mood and functioning and (b) changes in knowledge of fertility and cancer from baseline to 6-month follow-up.Methods: Participants completed five self-report baseline measures, accessed FCP content and participated in online discussions. At 6 months post FCP study entry, participants were asked to complete follow-up self-reports.Results: One hundred and six breast cancer survivors from 8 countries participated in the FCP. Mean age at diagnosis was 34.3 years; mean time since diagnosis was 22 months. Significant change was detected in improved physical functioning (p=0.019) and social functioning (p=0.02). Significant changes were also noted in improved fertility knowledge (p=0.011).Conclusion: Preliminary evidence shows that young breast cancer survivors derive improved mood and knowledge benefit from FCP participation. Internet-based approach may be a viable format for engaging this population of cancer survivors. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</docText>

        <docTitle>A phase 2 trial exploring the effects of high-dose (10,000 IU/day) vitamin D(3) in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.</docTitle>
        <docText>A phase 2 trial exploring the effects of high-dose (10,000 IU/day) vitamin D(3) in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.

BACKGROUND:: Vitamin D deficiency has potential roles in breast cancer etiology and progression. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with increased toxicity from bisphosphonate therapy. The optimal dose of vitamin D supplementation is unknown, but daily sunlight exposure can generate the equivalent of a 10,000-IU oral dose of vitamin D(3). This study therefore aimed to assess the effect of this dose of vitamin D(3) in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. METHODS:: Patients with bone metastases treated with bisphosphonates were enrolled into this single-arm phase 2 study. Patients received 10,000 IU of vitamin D(3) and 1000 mg of calcium supplementation each day for 4 months. The effect of this treatment on palliation, bone resorption markers, calcium metabolism, and toxicity were evaluated at baseline and monthly thereafter. RESULTS:: Forty patients were enrolled. No significant changes in bone resorption markers were seen. Despite no change in global pain scales, there was a significant reduction in the number of sites of pain. A small but statistically significant increase in serum calcium was seen, as was a significant decrease in serum parathyroid hormone. Treatment unmasked 2 cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, but was not associated with direct toxicity. CONCLUSIONS:: Daily doses of 10,000 IU vitamin D(3) for 4 months appear safe in patients without comorbid conditions causing hypersensitivity to vitamin D. Treatment reduced inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone levels, presumably caused by long-term bisphosphonate use. There did not appear to be a significant palliative benefit nor any significant change in bone resorption. Cancer 2010. (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.</docText>

        <docText>Antimullerian hormone and inhibin B are hormone measures of ovarian function in late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND:: In late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors, there is a need for real-time biomarkers of postchemotherapy ovarian function. The objective was to determine whether antimullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B are such biomarkers. The authors tested whether AMH and inhibin B were impacted by breast cancer treatment by comparing cancer survivors to age-matched control women and determined the association between these hormones and postchemotherapy menstrual pattern. METHODS:: Breast cancer patients (n = 127) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III disease who were premenopausal at diagnosis were enrolled postchemotherapy and observed. The primary endpoint was chemotherapy-related amenorrhea (CRA) (&gt;/=12 months of amenorrhea after chemotherapy). Matched pair analyses compared AMH, inhibin B, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels between cancer and age-matched control subjects. Associations between hormones, CRA status, and change in CRA status over time were assessed. RESULTS:: The median age of the patients at chemotherapy was 43.2 years (range, 26.7-57.8 years). At enrollment, median follow-up since chemotherapy was 2.1 years, and 55% of subjects had CRA. Compared with age-matched controls, cancer subjects had significantly lower AMH (P = .004) and inhibin B (P &lt; .001) and higher FSH (P &lt; .001). AMH (P = .002) and inhibin B (P = .001) were found to be significantly associated with risk of CRA, even after controlling for FSH. AMH was significantly lower (P = .03) and FSH was significantly higher (P = .04) in menstruating subjects who developed subsequent CRA. CONCLUSIONS:: AMH and inhibin B are 2 additional measures of postchemotherapy ovarian function in late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors. With further research and validation, these hormones may supplement limited current tools for assessing and predicting postchemotherapy ovarian function. Cancer 2010.

        <docText>Hybrid promoters directed tBid gene expression to breast cancer cells by transcriptional targeting.

Developing cancer gene therapy constructs based on transcriptional targeting of genes to cancer cells is a new and promising modality for treatment of cancer. Introducing truncated Bid (tBid), a recently known member of the Bcl-2 family, eradicates cancer cells efficiently. For transcriptional targeting of tBid, two dual-specificity promoters, combining cancer specific core promoters and response modules, were designed. These two core promoter modules contained cancer specific promoters of MUC1 and Survivin genes accompanied by hypoxia-responsive elements and estrogen responsive elements (microenvironment condition of breast cancer cells) which were employed to achieve a higher and more specific level of tBid expression in breast cancer cells. Correlation of the level of tBid expression in normal and cancer cell lines with promoter activity was measured by RT-PCR after treatment with hypoxia and estrogen. The level of tBid expression under control of new hybrid promoters was compared with its expression under control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter as a control. Our data revealed that the level of tBid expression in breast cancer cells were nearly 11 times more than normal cells because of the cancer specific promoters, although tBid expression under control of CMV promoter was almost the same in normal and cancer cell lines. Increased apoptosis was detected in the transfected breast cancer cell lines by the Caspase-3 activity assay. The application of these promoters may prove to have the advantage of tumor selective gene therapy in breast cancer cells and low-potential toxicity for normal tissues.

        <docText>Economic evaluation of a randomized clinical trial of hospital versus telephone follow-up after treatment for breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: This was an economic evaluation of hospital versus telephone follow-up by specialist nurses after treatment for breast cancer. METHODS: A cost minimization analysis was carried out from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective using data from a trial in which 374 women were randomized to telephone or hospital follow-up. Primary analysis compared NHS resource use for routine follow-up over a mean of 24 months. Secondary analyses included patient and carer travel and productivity costs, and NHS and personal social services costs of care in patients with recurrent breast cancer. RESULTS: Patients who had telephone follow-up had approximately 20 per cent more consultations (634 versus 524). The longer duration of telephone consultations and the frequent use of junior medical staff in hospital clinics resulted in higher routine costs for telephone follow-up (mean difference pound 55 (bias-corrected 95 per cent confidence interval (b.c.i.) pound 29 to pound 77)). There were no significant differences in the costs of treating recurrence, but patients who had hospital-based follow-up had significantly higher travel and productivity costs (mean difference pound 47 (95 per cent b.c.i. pound 40 to pound 55)). CONCLUSION: Telephone follow-up for breast cancer may reduce the burden on busy hospital clinics but will not necessarily lead to cost or salary savings.</docText>

        <docTitle>Our changing view of the genomic landscape of cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Our changing view of the genomic landscape of cancer.

Sporadic tumours, which account for the majority of all human cancers, arise from the acquisition of somatic, genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to changes in gene sequence, structure, copy number and expression. Within the last decade, the availability of a complete sequence-based map of the human genome, coupled with significant technological advances, has revolutionized the search for somatic alterations in tumour genomes. Recent landmark studies, which resequenced all coding exons within breast, colorectal, brain and pancreatic cancers, have shed new light on the genomic landscape of cancer. Within a given tumour type there are many infrequently mutated genes and a few frequently mutated genes, resulting in incredible genetic heterogeneity. However, when the altered genes are placed into biological processes and biochemical pathways, this complexity is significantly reduced and shared pathways that are affected in significant numbers of tumours can be discerned. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has opened up the potential to resequence entire tumour genomes to interrogate protein-encoding genes, non-coding RNA genes, non-genic regions and the mitochondrial genome. During the next decade it is anticipated that the most common forms of human cancer will be systematically surveyed to identify the underlying somatic changes in gene copy number, sequence and expression. The resulting catalogues of somatic alterations will point to candidate cancer genes requiring further validation to determine whether they have a causal role in tumourigenesis. The hope is that this knowledge will fuel improvements in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, based on the specific molecular alterations that drive individual tumours. In this review, I will provide a historical perspective on the identification of somatic alterations in the pre- and post-genomic eras, with a particular emphasis on recent pioneering studies that have provided unprecedented insights into the genomic landscape of human cancer.

        <docText>Sibship analysis of associations between SNP haplotypes and a continuous trait with application to mammographic density.

Haplotype-based association studies have been proposed as a powerful comprehensive approach to identify causal genetic variation underlying complex diseases. Data comparisons within families offer the additional advantage of dealing naturally with complex sources of noise, confounding and population stratification. Two problems encountered when investigating associations between haplotypes and a continuous trait using data from sibships are (i) the need to define within-sibship comparisons for sibships of size greater than two and (ii) the difficulty of resolving the joint distribution of haplotype pairs within sibships in the absence of parental genotypes. We therefore propose first a method of orthogonal transformation of both outcomes and exposures that allow the decomposition of between- and within-sibship regression effects when sibship size is greater than two. We conducted a simulation study, which confirmed analysis using all members of a sibship is statistically more powerful than methods based on cross-sectional analysis or using subsets of sib-pairs. Second, we propose a simple permutation approach to avoid errors of inference due to the within-sibship correlation of any errors in haplotype assignment. These methods were applied to investigate the association between mammographic density (MD), a continuously distributed and heritable risk factor for breast cancer, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes from the VDR gene using data from a study of 430 twins and sisters. We found evidence of association between MD and a 4-SNP VDR haplotype. In conclusion, our proposed method retains the benefits of the between- and within-pair analysis for pairs of siblings and can be implemented in standard software. Genet. Epidemiol. 2009.

        <docText>Cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant anastrozol in post-menopausal women with breast cancer.

OBJECTIVES: Carry out an economic analysis of the incorporation of anastrozole as adjuvant hormone therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer in a Brazilian setting. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness estimate comparing anastrozole to tamoxifen was made from the perspectives of the patient, private health insurance, and government. A Markov model was designed based on data from ATAC trial after 100 months follow-up in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 postmenopausal women in Brazil, using outcomes projections for a 25-year period. Resource utilization and associated costs were obtained from preselected sources and specialists' opinions. Treatment costs varied according to the perspective used. The incremental benefit was inserted in the model to obtain the cost of quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY). RESULTS: Benefit extrapolations for a 25-year time line showed an estimate of 0.29 QALY gained with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen. The cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained depended on which perspective was used. There was an increment of R$ 32.403,00/QALY in the public health system/government, R$ 32.230,00/QALY for private health system, and R$ 55.270,00/QALY for patients. CONCLUSION: The benefit from adjuvant anastrozole in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer is associated to major differences in cost-effectiveness ratio and varies with the different perspectives. According to current WHO parameters, the increment is considered acceptable under public and private health system perspectives, but not from that of the patient.</docText>

        <docText>Lymphangiosarcoma of the arm presenting with lymphedema in a woman 16 years after mastectomy: a case report.

Lymphangiosarcoma following breast cancer is a relatively rare entity, with around 300 cases so far reported worldwide. Affecting the long term survivors of breast cancer, lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Traves Syndrome) has a high mortality rate. Since lympedema following radical mastectomy or axillary clearance and radiotherapy seems to be the main predisposing factor, further research regarding modifications in the surgical technique of axillary nodes dissection as well as the development of new chemotherapeutic agents effective in lymphangiosarcoma are required.</docText>

        <docText>Granular cell tumor of the breast: a case report and review of literature.

A 22-year-old female patient presented with a breast mass lesion with a clinical suspicion of a fibroadenoma. Histological evaluation revealed a rare benign neoplasm - granular cell tumor.Granular cell tumor is rare neoplasm that may arise in virtually any body site, and in 5% it occurs in the breast. The histogenesis of this tumor is still rather controversial and currently the most acceptable theory is a Schwann cell origin. The main histological feature is granular cytoplasm of the tumor cells.From a clinical point of view there is a similarity between granular cell tumor and mammary carcinoma on mammography and ultrasound. Pathohistologically, sometimes, differential diagnostic difficulties exist concerning apocrine carcinoma, histiocytic lesions and metastatic neoplasms.</docText>

        <docText>Columnar cell lesions and pseudoangiomatous hyperplasia like stroma: is there an epithelial-stromal interaction?

The significance of association between cancer and its microenvironment has been increasingly recognized. It has been shown in animal models that interaction between neoplastic epithelial cells and adjacent stroma can modulate tumor behavior. Carcinoma associated stromal cells can transform normal epithelial cells into neoplastic cells. In breast, columnar cell lesions are non-obligate precursors of low grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Columnar cell lesions can be seen intimately associated with PASH-like-stroma, a lesion we termed as CCPLS. Our aim is to investigate epithelial-stromal interactions in CCPLS and compare them to PASH without columnar cell lesions in breast core needle biopsies. Normal terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) epithelium was seen in association with columnar cell lesions as well as PASH. Eight (8) cases of each category were examined by a panel of immunostains: CD117 (C-kit), CD34, CD105, bFGF, AR, ER-beta, MIB-1. We observed a markedly decreased expression of c-kit in columnar cell lesions compared to TDLU-epithelium. CD105 showed a quantitative increase in activated vessels in CCPLS compared to PASH. A subset of CCPLS and PASH were androgen receptor positive. A strong nuclear positivity for ER-beta is observed in the epithelium and stroma of all CCPLS cases. We conclude that (1) activated blood vessels predominate in CCPLS; (2) A molecular alteration is signified by c-kit loss in columnar cell lesions; (3) ER-beta and androgen receptor positivity indicate CCPLS are hormonally responsive lesions. Our study suggests an intimate vascular and hormone dependent epithelial-stromal interaction exists in CCPLS lesions.</docText>

        <docText>DNA repair in Etoposide-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients and healthy women.

The present study evaluated the basal DNA damage and the cellular response to this damage induced by in vitro administration of Etoposide in lymphocytes donated by twenty untreated breast cancer (BC) patients and twenty age-matched healthy women. Micronucleus (MN) and alkaline Comet assays were performed in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) according to a standard protocol for in vitro treatment with various concentrations of Etoposide or a control. For the Comet Assay, three samples of cells were collected: T(0) (immediately preceding treatment of the cultures), T(1) (immediately after completion of the treatment) and T(2) (four hours after completion of the treatment). MN frequency in the BC group treated with 25 muM Etoposide (19.1 +/- 7.35) was significantly higher than the control (10.9 +/- 9.87) group. In the alkaline Comet Assay, both the BC group and the healthy women showed the ability to repair Etoposide-induced DNA damage within 4 hours of reincubation.</docText>

HER-2 is overexpressed in 20 to 30% of breast cancer. Generally, metastases of a breast tumor have the same HER-2 status, although some discordances were reported.We report a case of reduction in HER-2 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry, following one day of a Trastuzumab injection, of a metastatic breast cancer to lymph nodes. Initially, the breast tumor HER-2 status was positive according to the same technique.We raise a hypothesis about technical interference and discuss the case in the framework of the existing literature.</docText>

        <docText>Effect of collimator and couch angle change on breast IMRT dose distributions.

Intensity modulated tangential photon beams for breast cancer treatment can improve the dose uniformity significantly throughout the whole breast and reduce the dose to the lung and the heart comparing with the conventional technique. Before the first treatment, patient setup may require a change on the collimator angle and/or the couch angle based on the chest wall coverage according to the port films. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of the collimator and the couch angle change on the dose distribution for breast cancer treatment using intensity modulated tangential photon beams, and thus to determine the clinical acceptable range of the angle change for routine treatment. Ten breast cases treated with intensity modulated tangential photon beams were analyzed in this study. Patient-specific CT data and the RTP files obtained from our home-grown Monte Carlo based breast IMRT treatment planning system were used for IMRT dose re-calculation with collimator or couch angle changes. The isodose distributions and DVHs were compared with the original plans and the effects of the collimator and couch angle change to breast IMRT dose distributions were evaluated. Our results show that a 4-degree change in the collimator angle or the couch angle did not affect the dose distribution significantly and it is acceptable in the clinic for patient treatment.</docText>

        <docTitle>P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins and human organic anion transporting polypeptide influence the intracellular accumulation of atazanavir.</docTitle>
        <docText>P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins and human organic anion transporting polypeptide influence the intracellular accumulation of atazanavir.

BACKGROUND: Drug efflux (for example, P-glycoprotein [P-gp], multidrug resistance-associated proteins [MRPs] and breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP]) and influx (for example, human organic anion transporting polypeptide [hOCTP] or human organic anion transporting polypeptide [hOATP]) transporters alter the cellular concentrations of some HIV protease inhibitors (HPIs). Here, we studied the lipophilicity and uptake of [(3)H]-atazanavir (ATV) in CEM (parental), CEM(VBL) (P-gp-overexpressing), CEM(E1000) (MRP1-overexpressing) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and evaluate the effects of modulators of drug transporters on uptake. METHODS: Lipophilicity was measured by octanol/saline partition method. The influence of influx/efflux transporters on uptake was evaluated in the absence and presence of inhibitors of P-gp (GPV031), P-gp/BCRP (tariquidar and GF120918), P-gp/MRP1 (dipyridamole and daidzein), MRP1/2 (frusemide and genistein), hOATP/hOCTP (estrone-3-sulfate [E-3-S]) and hOATP/hOCTP/MRP (probenecid). The effects of a number of HPIs on uptake were also evaluated. Data from digitonin permeabilized cells allowed the evaluation of the contribution of cellular binding to total drug uptake, whereas the inhibitory effect of ATV on P-gp was assessed by daunomycin efflux/uptake assays. RESULTS: [(3)H]-ATV is lipophilic and accumulates in the cultured cells as follows: CEM&gt;CEM(E1000)&gt;CEM(VBL). Tariquidar, GF120918 and daidzein significantly increased the uptake of [(3)H]-ATV in the cultured cells. By contrast, only daidzein and tipranavir significantly increased uptake in PBMCs, with tariquidar and frusemide devoid of effects, whereas dipyridamole, E-3-S, GPV031 and genistein significantly decreased accumulation. ATV inhibits P-gp activity; manipulation of uptake with digitonin suggests binding of [(3)H]-ATV to P-gp. CONCLUSIONS: [(3)H]-ATV is lipophilic, a P-gp, MRP and hOATP substrate and an inhibitor of P-gp. Concomitant administration of ATV with drugs and dietary components (for example, daidzein and genistein) that interact with these transporters could alter its pharmacokinetics.</docText>

        <docText>Malignancy Is Associated with Dermatomyositis But Not Polymyositis in Northern New England, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate the association of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and malignancy in patients seen at 1 academic center over a 23-year period. METHODS: Patients were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes and diagnoses, then confirmed by chart review. Population cancer statistics obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control for Vermont and New Hampshire were used for comparison. RESULTS: Chart review confirmed IIM in 198 of 483 patients initially identified by ICD-9 codes. Within 5 years of diagnosis with IIM, malignancy developed in 32 patients (16.2%), 24 of whom (75%) had dermatomyositis (DM). Malignancy and DM developed within 1 year in 75%. The cancer risk associated with DM was much greater than the risk associated with other IIM. The most frequent tumor types were breast, lung, pancreas, and colon. DM patients with cancer were more frequently male and &gt;/= 45 years of age than those without cancer. There were no cases of interstitial lung disease among patients with cancer and any form of IIM. The incidence of cancer was increased in patients with DM compared to age- and sex-matched population controls, both over a 5-year interval surrounding the diagnosis of DM and over the lifetime interval following diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The risk of cancer in IIM is concentrated among patients with DM. The association between DM and cancer was enhanced by its temporal relationship (&lt; 1 year) in 87.5% of these cases. Patients with malignancy-associated DM were more frequently male and over age 45 and less likely to have interstitial lung disease.</docText>

        <docText>Factors that determine satisfaction with surgical treatment of low-income women with breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between patient satisfaction with surgical treatment and 4 consultation skills and processes of the surgeons (time spent, listens carefully, explains concepts in a way the patient can understand, and shows respect for what the patient has to say), controlling for a range of patient, surgeon, and treatment characteristics. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program for the state of California. PATIENTS: A statewide sample of 789 low-income women who received treatment for breast cancer from February 1, 2003, through September 31, 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Satisfaction with surgical treatment. RESULTS: Three of every 4 women reported being extremely satisfied with the treatment they received from their surgeon. African American women and those with arm swelling were less likely to be satisfied, whereas those reporting that the surgeon always spent enough time and explained concepts in a way they could understand were more likely to report greater satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of 2 relatively simple behaviors that surgeons can easily implement to increase patient satisfaction, which can be of potential benefit in the litigious world of today.</docText>

        <docText>The AHR regulates cell cycle progression in human breast cancer cells via a functional interaction with CDK4.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor with constitutive activities as well as those induced by xenobiotic ligands, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). One unexplained cellular role for the AHR has been its ability to promote cell cycle progression in the absence of exogenous ligands, while treatment with exogenous ligands induces cell cycle arrest. Within the cell cycle, progression from G1 to S phase is controlled by sequential phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) by cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes. In this study, the functional interactions between the AHR, CDK4, and CCND1 were investigated as a potential mechanism for the cell cycle regulation by the AHR. Time course cell cycle and molecular experiments were performed in human breast cancer cells. The results demonstrated that the AHR and CDK4 interact within the cell cycle and the interaction was disrupted upon TCDD treatment. The disruption was temporally correlated with G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased phosphorylation of RB1. Biochemical reconstitution assays using in vitro translated protein recapitulated the AHR and CDK4 interaction and showed that CCND1 was also part of the complex. In vitro assays for CDK4 kinase activity demonstrated that RB1 phosphorylation by the AHR:CDK4:CCND1 complex was reduced in the presence of TCDD. The results suggest that the AHR interacts in a complex with CDK4 and CCND1 in the absence of exogenous ligands to facilitate cell cycle progression. This interaction is disrupted by exogenous ligands, such as TCDD, to induce G1 cell cycle arrest.</docText>

        <docText>Tubular Carcinoma of the Breast: Further Evidence to Support Its Excellent Prognosis.

PURPOSE: Although tubular carcinoma (TC) is known to have a favorable prognosis, it is still unknown whether this subtype represents a distinct type of breast carcinoma or whether it behaves like other low-grade luminal A-type breast carcinomas. METHODS: In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of a large well-characterized series of breast cancers (2,608 carcinomas) to assess the clinicopathologic and molecular features and prognostic value of TC compared with grade 1 ductal carcinomas of the breast. RESULTS: When compared with grade 1 ductal carcinoma (n = 212), TC (n = 102) was more likely to be detected on mammographic screening, had smaller median size, and less frequently showed lymphovascular invasion. Compared with grade 1 ductal carcinoma, TC was associated with longer disease-free survival (chi(2) = 13.25, P &lt; .001) and breast cancer-specific survival (chi(2) = 8.8, P = .003). In this study, none of the patients with TC developed distant metastasis or died from the disease without an intervening recurrence as invasive carcinoma of different histologic type. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the biologic behavior of TC is excellent and is more favorable than that of grade 1 ductal carcinoma. Patients with TC may be at risk of developing second primary carcinomas in the contralateral breast, which may be of higher grade and poorer potential prognostic outcome. In addition, patients with TC seem to have a close to normal life expectancy, and as a consequence, adjuvant systemic therapy may not be justified in their routine management.</docText>

        <docText>Tumor-Associated Lymphocytes As an Independent Predictor of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.

PURPOSE: Preclinical data suggest a contribution of the immune system to chemotherapy response. In this study, we investigated the prespecified hypothesis that the presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate in cancer tissue predicts the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: We investigated intratumoral and stromal lymphocytes in a total of 1,058 pretherapeutic breast cancer core biopsies from two neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-based studies (GeparDuo, n = 218, training cohort; and GeparTrio, n = 840, validation cohort). Molecular parameters of lymphocyte recruitment and activation were evaluated by kinetic polymerase chain reaction in 134 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. RESULTS: In a multivariate regression analysis including all known predictive clinicopathologic factors, the percentage of intratumoral lymphocytes was a significant independent parameter for pathologic complete response (pCR) in both cohorts (training cohort: P = .012; validation cohort: P = .001). Lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer responded, with pCR rates of 42% (training cohort) and 40% (validation cohort). In contrast, those tumors without any infiltrating lymphocytes had pCR rates of 3% (training cohort) and 7% (validation cohort). The expression of inflammatory marker genes and proteins was linked to the histopathologic infiltrate, and logistic regression showed a significant association of the T-cell-related markers CD3D and CXCL9 with pCR. CONCLUSION: The presence of tumor-associated lymphocytes in breast cancer is a new independent predictor of response to anthracycline/taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy and provides useful information for oncologists to identify a subgroup of patients with a high benefit from this type of chemotherapy.</docText>

        <docTitle>Phase II Clinical Trial of Ixabepilone in Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Platinum- and Taxane-Resistant Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.</docTitle>
        <docText>Phase II Clinical Trial of Ixabepilone in Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Platinum- and Taxane-Resistant Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.

PURPOSE: Ixabepilone (BMS-247550) is a microtubule-stabilizing epothilone B analog with activity in taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer. The Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted a phase II evaluation of the efficacy and safety of ixabepilone in patients with recurrent or persistent platinum- and taxane-resistant primary ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with measurable platinum- and taxane-resistant ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma, defined as progression during or within 6 months of one prior course of treatment with each agent, received intravenous ixabepilone 20 mg/m(2) administered over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. RESULTS: Of 51 patients entered, 49 were eligible. The objective response rate was 14.3% (95% CI, 5.9% to 27.2%), with three complete and four partial responses. Twenty patients (40.8%) had stable disease, whereas sixteen (32.7%) had increasing disease. The median time to progression was 4.4 months (95% CI, 0.8 to 32.6+ months); median survival was 14.8 months (95% CI, 0.8 to 50.0) months. Patients received a median of two treatment cycles (range, 1 to 29 cycles), and 18.4% of patients received &gt;/= six cycles. Adverse effects included peripheral grade 2 (28.5%) and grade 3 (6.1%) neuropathy, grades 3 to 4 neutropenia (20.4%), grade 3 fatigue (14.3%), grade 3 nausea/emesis (22%), grade 3 diarrhea (10%), and grade 3 mucositis (4%). CONCLUSION: Ixabepilone 20 mg/m(2) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle demonstrates antitumor activity and acceptable safety in patients with platinum- and taxane-resistant recurrent or persistent ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma.</docText>

        <docText>Effectiveness of a Home Care Nursing Program in the Symptom Management of Patients With Colorectal and Breast Cancer Receiving Oral Chemotherapy: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.

PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of a symptom-focused home care program in patients with cancer who were receiving oral chemotherapy in relation to toxicity levels, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and service utilization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial was carried out with 164 patients with a diagnosis of colorectal (n = 110) and breast (n = 54) cancers who were receiving oral capecitabine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a home care program by a nurse or standard care for 18 weeks (ie, six cycles of chemotherapy). Toxicity assessments were carried out weekly for the duration of the patients' participation in the trial, and validated self-report tools assessed anxiety, depression, and quality of life. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in the home care group in relation to the symptoms of oral mucositis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, pain, fatigue (first four cycles), and insomnia (all P &lt; .05). This improvement was most significant during the initial two cycles. Unplanned service utilization, particularly the number of inpatient days (57 v 167 days; P = .02), also was lower in the home care group. CONCLUSION: A symptom-focused home care program was able to assist patients to manage their treatment adverse effects more effectively than standard care. It is imperative that patients receiving oral chemotherapy are supported with such programs, particularly during initial treatment cycles, to improve their treatment and symptom experiences.</docText>

        <docText>Impact of Two Supportive Care Interventions on Anxiety, Depression, Quality of Life, and Unmet Needs in Patients With Nonlocalized Breast and Colorectal Cancers.

PURPOSE: Patients with cancer experience considerable symptom burden, psychological morbidity, and unmet psychosocial needs. Research suggests that feedback of patient-reported outcomes to clinicians or caseworkers, alongside management strategies, may result in improved patient functioning. Two intervention models were developed to test this effect in a randomized, controlled trial against usual care (UC): a telephone caseworker (TCW) model and an oncologist/general practitioner (O/GP) model. Primary end points included anxiety, depression, physical/emotional functioning, and unmet supportive care needs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with nonlocalized breast or colorectal cancers were surveyed by computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) at three time points: baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data collected from participant CATIs in the supportive care models were used to generate feedback to either each participant's designated TCW, or their nominated O/GPs. Data obtained from participants in the UC model were used only to assess the impact of supportive care models. In total, 356 participants consented to study participation, completed the baseline CATI, and were randomly assigned to the UC, TCW, or O/GP groups. RESULTS: No overall intervention effect was observed. Physical functioning was significantly improved at the third CATI for participants in the TCW model (P = .01), and there was a trend toward fewer participants with unmet needs (P = .07). TCW group participants also were more likely to have the following: identified issues of need discussed (P &lt; .0001); referrals made (P &lt; .0001); and strong agreement that the intervention improved communication with their health care team (P = .0005). CONCLUSION: The TCW model holds some promise; however, additional work in at-risk populations is required before we recommend implementation.</docText>

        <docText>Trastuzumab for Patients With Axillary-Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Results of the FNCLCC-PACS 04 Trial.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab in patients with node-positive breast cancer treated with surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy if applicable. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three thousand ten patients with operable node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel. Patients who presented human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -overexpressing tumors were secondary randomly assigned to either a sequential regimen of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for 1 year or observation. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Overall 528 patients were randomly assigned between trastuzumab (n = 260) and observation (n = 268) arm. Of the 234 patients (90%) who received at least one administration of trastuzumab, 196 (84%) received at least 6 months of treatment, and 41 (18%) discontinued treatment due to cardiac events (any grade). At the date of analysis (October 2007), 129 DFS events were recorded. Random assignment to the trastuzumab arm was associated with a nonsignificant 14% reduction in the risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.22; P = .41, log-rank stratified on pathologic node involvement). Three-year DFS rates were 78% (95% CI, 72.3 to 82.5) and 81% (95% CI, 75.3 to 85.4) in the observation and trastuzumab arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: After a 47-month median follow-up, 1 year of trastuzumab given sequentially after adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of relapse.</docText>

        <docTitle>Dual Promoter Regulation of Death-associated Protein Kinase Gene Leads to Differentially Silenced Transcripts by Methylation in Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Dual Promoter Regulation of Death-associated Protein Kinase Gene Leads to Differentially Silenced Transcripts by Methylation in Cancer.

Death associated protein kinase (DAPK), a mediator of apoptotic systems, is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in lung and breast tumors. This gene has a CpG island extending 2500 bp from the translational start site; however, studies characterizing its transcriptional regulation have not been conducted. Two transcripts for DAPK were identified that code for a single protein, while being regulated by two promoters. The previously identified DAPK transcript designated exon 1 transcript was expressed at levels 3-fold greater than the alternate exon 1b transcript. Deletion constructs of promoter 1 identified a 332 bp region containing a functional CP2 binding site important for expression of the exon 1 transcript. While moderate reporter activity was seen in promoter 2, the region comprising intron 1 and containing a HNF3B binding site sustained expression of the alternate transcript. Sequencing the DAPK CpG island in tumor cell lines revealed dense, but heterogeneous methylation of CpGs that blocked access of the CP2 and HNF3B proteins that in turn, was associated with loss of transcription that was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Prevalences were similar for methylation of promoter 1 and 2 and intron 1 in lung tumors, but significantly greater in promoter 2 and intron 1 in breast tumors, indicative of tissue-specific differences in silencing these two transcripts. These studies show for the first time, dual promoter regulation of DAPK, a tumor suppressor gene silenced in many cancers, and substantiate the importance of screening for silencing of both transcripts in tumors.</docText>

        <docText>Sensory-motor axonal peripheral neuropathy in an advanced breast cancer patient treated with ixabepilone.

Ixabepilone is a novel microtubule-stabilising agent used as monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine to treat taxane- and anthracycline-refractory breast cancer. We report the case of a patient who experienced an unusual motor neuropathy after the first cycle. This is a very uncommon secondary effect, but it must be taken into account as a possible complication of treatment with ixabepilone.</docText>

        <docText>Animal models of breast cancer for the study of pathogenesis and therapeutic insights.

Activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes are common events during breast cancer initiation and progression and often determine treatment responsiveness. Indeed, these events need to be recreated in in vitro systems and in mouse cancer models in order to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer initiation and metastasis and assess their possible impact on responses to anticancer drugs. Opticalbased imaging models are used to investigate and to follow important tumour progression processes. Moreover, the development of novel anticancer strategies requires more sensitive and less invasive methods to detect and monitor in vivo drug responses in breast cancer models. This review highlights some of the current strategies for modelling breast cancer in vitro and in the mouse, in order to answer biological or translational questions about human breast malignancies.</docText>

        <docText>The putative lipid raft modulator miltefosine displays immunomodulatory action in T-cell dependent dermal inflammation models.

Miltefosine is currently marketed for treatment of skin metastasis of breast cancer and leishmaniasis. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, however, miltefosine is considered to be a prototype lipid raft modulator. The compound was shown to inhibit anti-IgE induced histamine release from human skin mast cell. After topical treatment it reduced skin reaction in allergic human volunteers undergoing skin prick test. The aim of this study was to test whether miltefosine could also modify T-cell signalling and whether the drug may be useful for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Miltefosine (20microM) inhibited T-cell proliferation by &gt;50% in the mixed lymphocyte test. In the toluene diisocyanate induced ear swelling test, miltefosine, administered topically as 2 and 6% solution or orally, attenuated ear swelling reaching 70% of the effect of dexamethasone at 100mg/kg p.o. (P&lt;0.01). The ear tissue content of the cytokines IL1ss, IL4 and IL6 was also reduced reaching 56% or 52% reduction of IL1ss (P&lt;0.01) after 2% topical or 100mg/kg p.o. Miltefosine significantly attenuated the allergic sensitization in the model of ovalbumin induced delayed-type hypersensitivity in mice. In a model of toluene diisocyanate induced scratching a significant (P=0.0047) reduction of scratching from 47 to 6 bouts was achieved with 100mg/kg p.o. The data indicate that miltefosine modulates T-cell function in models for Th1 and Th2 related activity. This profile opens up the possibility for the treatment of T-cell related allergic diseases with a novel class of lipid raft modulator drugs such as miltefosine.</docText>

        <docText>Factors necessary to produce basoapical polarity in human glandular epithelium formed in conventional and high-throughput three-dimensional culture: example of the breast epithelium.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Basoapical polarity in epithelia is critical for proper tissue function, and control of proliferation and survival. Cell culture models that recapitulate epithelial tissue architecture are invaluable to unravel developmental and disease mechanisms. Although factors important for the establishment of basal polarity have been identified, requirements for the formation of apical polarity in three-dimensional tissue structures have not been thoroughly investigated. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the human mammary epithelial cell line-3522 S1, provides a resilient model for studying the formation of basoapical polarity in glandular structures. Testing three-dimensional culture systems that differ in composition and origin of substrata reveals that apical polarity is more sensitive to culture conditions than basal polarity. Using a new high-throughput culture method that produces basoapical polarity in glandular structures without a gel coat, we show that basal polarity-mediated signaling and collagen IV are both necessary for the development of apical polarity. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new insights into the role of the basement membrane, and especially collagen IV, in the development of the apical pole, a critical element of the architecture of glandular epithelia. Also, the high-throughput culture method developed in this study should open new avenues for high-content screening of agents that act on mammary tissue homeostasis and thus, on architectural changes involved in cancer development.</docText>

        <docText>Alpha-eleostearic acid suppresses proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells via activation of PPARgamma and inhibition of ERK 1 / 2.

Alpha-eleostearic acid (alpha-ESA) is known to suppress the growth in cancer cells although its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The present study was designed to elucidate and evaluate the anticancer mechanism of alpha-ESA on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Also, an attempt was made to better understand the anticancer mechanism by which alpha-ESA activated PPARgamma and attenuated the ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation state. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell-line and nontumorigenic MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells were treated with alpha-ESA and compared with negative control (without treatment) and positive control groups (treated with rosiglitazone), and changes of apoptosis-related molecules, PPARgamma and pERK1/2 were examined. In MCF-7 cells treated with alpha-ESA, we found that the expression of p53, p21, and Bax was up-regulated whereas expression of Bcl-2 and procaspase-9 was down-regulated. Moreover, nuclear translocation of PPARgamma by alpha-ESA positively correlated with inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. Our data suggest that alpha-ESA can be considered to be a PPARgamma agonist and thus a candidate for a chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer. (Cancer Sci 2009; 00: 000-000).</docText>

        <docText>The circadian clock gene Per1 suppresses cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth at specific times of day.

Cell cycle progression is tightly regulated. The expressions of cell cycle regulators, the products of which either promote or inhibit cell proliferation, oscillate during each cell cycle. Cellular proliferation and the expression of cell cycle regulators are also controlled by the circadian clock. Disruption of the circadian clock may thereby lead to deregulated cell proliferation. Mammalian Per2 is a core clock gene, the product of which suppresses cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Because Per1, another key clock gene, is mutated in human breast cancers, and because its clock functions are similar and complementary to those of Per2, we have studied its role in modulating breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. We find that breast cancer growth rate is gated by the circadian clock with two daily peaks and troughs, and that they are coupled to the daily expression patterns of clock-controlled genes that regulate cell proliferation. Down-regulation of the expression of tumor Per1 increases cancer cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo by enhancing the circadian amplitude of the two daily tumor growth peaks. The data of the study suggest Per1 has tumor-suppressor function that diminishes cancer proliferation and tumor growth, but only at specific times of day.</docText>

        <docText>Assessment of Breast Cancer-Related Arm Lymphedema-Comparison of Physical Measurement Methods and Self-Report.

ABSTRACT Purpose: To determine the relationship between physical methods of measuring lymphedema and self-reported swelling, their reliability, and standard error of measurement. Method: Lymphedema in each arm of women with (n = 33) and without (n = 18) unilateral arm lymphedema, secondary to breast cancer was measured by self-report, bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), perometer, and the truncated cone method. Results: The physical measurement tools were highly reliable (ICC((2,1)): 0.94 to 1.00) with high concordance (r(c): 0.89 to 0.99). Selfreport correlatedmoderately with physical measurements (r = 0.65 to 0.71) and was moderately reliable (ICC((2,1)): 0.70). Conclusions: Lymphedema assessment methods are concordant and reliable but not interchangeable.</docText>

        <docText>BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ubiquitin ligase can modify histones H2A and H2B in the nucleosome particle.

BRCA1, the protein product of the Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene (BRCA1) has been implicated in multiple pathways that preserve genome stability, including cell cycle control, DNA repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. BRCA1, in complex with another RING-domain protein BARD1, possesses ubiquitin-ligase activity. Only a few targets for this activity have been identified in vivo. Nucleosomal histones may also be targets in vivo since they can be modified by the BRCA1/BARD1 complex in vitro. Here we demonstrate that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex can ubiquitylate both free H2A and H2B histones and histones in the context of nucleosomal particles. These results raise the possibility that BRCA1/BARD1 can directly affect nucleosomal structure, dynamics, and function through its ability to modify nucleosomal histones.</docText>

        <docText>3,5,3',4',5'-Pentamethoxystilbene (MR-5), a Synthetically Methoxylated Analogue of Resveratrol, Inhibits Growth and Induces G1 Cell Cycle Arrest of Human Breast Carcinoma MCF-7 Cells.

3,5,3',4',5'-Pentamethoxystilbene (MR-5) is a synthetically methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and has been suggested to have antitumor activity because of structural similarity to resveratrol. Herein, we investigate the antiproliferative effect of MR-5 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and demonstrate that MR-5 had a more potent inhibition on cell growth compared with resveratrol and other methoxylated derivatives. Exploring the growth-inhibitory mechanisms of MR-5, we found that it is accompanied by G1 cell cycle arrest, which coincides with a marked inhibition of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins, including decreased cyclins (D1/D3/E) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2/4/6) and increased CDK inhibitors (CKIs) such as p15, p16, p21, and p27. Furthermore, the increase in CKI levels by MR-5 resulted in a concomitant increase in their interactions of CDK4 and CDK2, along with a strong inhibition in CDK4 kinase activity and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. MR-5 also modulated some critical kinase activities related to cell cycle regulation, including Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in MCF-7 cells. In total, our results demonstrate that MR-5 affects multiple cellular targets that contribute to its antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 cells and provide novel information for synthetic chemists to design new antitumor agents with introduction of methoxylated group(s) in the basic compound.</docText>

        <docText>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an inherited, autosomal dominant disorder distinguished by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and pigmented mucocutaneous lesions. Prevalence of PJS is estimated from 1 in 8300 to 1 in 280,000 individuals. PJS predisposes sufferers to various malignancies (gastrointestinal, pancreatic, lung, breast, uterine, ovarian and testicular tumors). Bleeding, obstruction and intussusception are common complications in patients with PJS. Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) allows examination and treatment of the small bowel. Polypectomy using DBE may obviate the need for repeated urgent operations and small bowel resection that leads to short bowel syndrome. Prophylaxis and polypectomy of the entire small bowel is the gold standard in PJS patients. Intraoperative enteroscopy (IOE) was the only possibility for endoscopic treatment of patients with PJS before the DBE era. Both DBE and IOE facilitate exploration and treatment of the small intestine. DBE is less invasive and more convenient for the patient. Both procedures are generally safe and useful. An overall recommendation for PJS patients includes not only gastrointestinal multiple polyp resolution, but also regular lifelong cancer screening (colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound of the pancreas, chest X-ray, mammography and pelvic examination with ultrasound in women, and testicular examination in men). Although the incidence of PJS is low, it is important for clinicians to recognize these disorders to prevent morbidity and mortality in these patients, and to perform presymptomatic testing in the first-degree relatives of PJS patients.</docText>

        <docText>A quantum chemical and chemometrical study of indolo2,1-bquinazoline and their analogues with cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells.

Some indolo[2,1-b]quinalozine (tryptanthrin) analogues present cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cells. In this work, chemometric methods were applied in the search for building discriminant models between active and inactive analogues, based on the correlations among their in vitro cytotoxic activities and their electronic and geometric molecular descriptors. From 88 descriptors calculated with density functional theory with the exchange correlation functional B3LYP and the basis set 6-31G* (Gaussian 03), 29 were pre-selected based on their Fisher weights, and finally five descriptors (partial charge on atom 15, bond orders between atoms 12-13, 17-25 and 18-26, and energy difference between frontier molecular orbitals) were selected for principal component analysis. This analysis was able to discriminate 12 inactive from 22 active analogues by using only one principal component, accounting for 49% of the total variance and allowing us to better understand the influence of these electronic descriptors in the cytotoxic activity. In addition, a supervised partial least-squares discriminant model was build and successfully used to discriminate tryptanthrin analogues. The model was validated through an independent test set and considered robust to overfitting.</docText>

        <docText>Vitamin D association with estradiol and progesterone in young women.

OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D may reduce breast cancer risk through an effect on steroid hormones in cycling women. We conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and estradiol and progesterone in young women. METHODS: Volunteer women aged 18-22 and not using hormonal contraceptives were recruited during summer and winter. They provided demographic and lifestyle information and a blood sample. Women recruited in winter gave a second sample after taking vitamin D supplement for 4 weeks. There were 101 women sampled during the luteal phase (1-14 days prior to the start of the next menstrual period). Generalized estimating equation linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between 25(OH)D and estradiol and progesterone. RESULTS: Per increase of 10 nmol/l of 25(OH)D, progesterone multiplicatively decreased by a factor of 10% (95% CI 5-14%, p &lt; 0.001) and estradiol decreased by a factor of 3% (95% CI 0-6%, p = 0.04) after adjustment for age, body mass index, ethnicity, season, alcohol use, smoking, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of vitamin D may reduce progesterone and estradiol, providing a potential mechanism for reduction in breast cancer risk from increased vitamin D exposure in young women.</docText>

        <docText>Inhibition of metastasis in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model by liposomes preventing tumor cell-platelet interactions.

The interaction between circulating tumor cells and blood components, mainly platelets, plays an important role during metastasis. In this study, we prepared liposomes containing the platelet aggregation inhibitor Cilostazol (Cil-L). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of this Cil-L on platelet aggregation and complex formation with murine 4T1 breast cancer cells in vitro and to determine their anti-metastatic potency in a spontaneous metastasis model of 4T1 breast cancer. Cil-L significantly inhibited the aggregation of platelets by up to 78% and completely abolished the complex formation of 4T1 tumor cells in the presence of activated platelets in vitro. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of Cil-L into mice significantly reduced the aggregability of mouse platelets by 60% measured ex vivo. To gain deeper insight into the mode of metastasis formation in a spontaneous metastasis model, 4T1 breast cancer cells were transplanted into the mammary fad pad of mice and metastasis to the mouse lungs was investigated with regard to tumor cell settlement and metastatic growth. We could demonstrate that the formation of pulmonary metastases was significantly reduced by 55% when mice were treated intravenously with 100 nmol Cil-L 6 h before tumor cell inoculation and then daily for 2 weeks. We conclude that Cil-L reduced metastasis by restricting the aggregability of mouse platelets, which probably prevents the interaction between circulating 4T1 tumor cells and platelets, making the Cil-L a useful tool for the inhibition of breast cancer metastasis in mice.</docText>

        <docText>Concordant HER2 status between metastatic breast cancer cells in CSF and primary breast cancer tissue.

It is not known whether the HER2 status of malignant CSF cells coincides with that of the original breast carcinoma cells. We investigated whether CSF cytology specimens were suitable to evaluate HER2 status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in patient with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). Both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissue and liquid based CSF cytology specimens were evaluated for HER2 status in 16 patients with LM. We evaluated HER2 gene amplification using FISH on destained CSF cytology slides containing a minimum of 20 malignant cells per slide, and compared these with the HER2 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or FISH in FFPE tissues. HER2 was considered positive when the HER2:CEP17 ratio was &gt;/=2.0 or IHC 3+. Of 16 cases, four were HER2 positive and 12 were HER2 negative by FISH analysis in CSF cytology. All CSF-positive cases were HER2 positive by IHC in FFPE tissue. Of 12 HER2 FISH-negative cases in CSF cytology, 10 were HER2 negative (IHC 0 or 1+) and two were IHC 2+ in FFPE tissue. Two IHC 2+ cases had HER2:CEP17 ratios of 1.27 and 2.1, respectively, by FISH in FFPE tissue. As a result, the HER2 status concordance rate between metastatic breast cancer cells in CSF and FFPE primary tissue by IHC and FISH was very high. When CSF cytology specimens were appropriately prepared and had adequate cellularity without dry artifacts, the CSF cytology was suitable to evaluate HER2 status by FISH analysis in patients with LM.</docText>

        <docText>Expression of metalloproteases and their inhibitors in different histological types of breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Metalloproteases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) are involved in several key aspects of tumoral growth, invasion and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to characterize on how the different histological types of breast cancer differ in the expression of several components of this enzymatic system. METHODS: An immunohistochemical study was performed in 50 ductal, 23 lobular, 14 mucinous, 7 tubular, 4 papillary and 5 medullary invasive carcinomas, using tissue arrays and specific antibodies against 7 MMPs and 3 tisullar TIMPs. Staining results were categorized by means of a specific software program (score values). RESULTS: Carcinomas of the ductal type showed higher score values for MMPs and TIMPs than the other histological types; whereas mucinous carcinomas had lower scores values for expressions of the majority of these proteins. Stromal fibroblasts were more frequently positive for MMP-1, -7 and -13 and TIMP-1 and -3, when present in carcinomas of the ductal type than in other histological types of breast carcinomas. Stromal mononuclear inflammatory cells were more frequently positive for MMP-1 and TIMP-3, but more often negative for MMP-7, -9 and -11, when located in carcinomas of the ductal type than in other histological types of breast carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: We found variations in MMP/TIMP expressions among the different histological subtypes of breast carcinomas suggesting differences in their tumor pathophysiology.</docText>

        <docText>Cyclin D1 is a direct target of JAG1-mediated Notch signaling in breast cancer.

The Notch ligand, JAG1 is associated with breast cancer recurrence. Herein, we report on a genomics approach to elucidate mechanisms downstream of JAG1 that promote breast cancer growth. In a survey of 46 breast cancer cell lines, we found that triple negative (TN; basal and mesenchymal ER-, PR-, and Her2-negative) lines express JAG1 at significantly higher levels than do HER2(+) or luminal (ER(+)) Her2(-) cell lines. In contrast to the luminal lines tested (T47D and MCF7), TN breast cancer cell lines (HCC1143 and MDA MB231) display high-level JAG1 expression and growth inhibition with RNA interference-induced JAG1 down-regulation. We used microarray profiling of TN tumor cells transfected with JAG1 siRNA to identify JAG1-regulated genes (P &lt;/= 0.005; fold change &gt;/=1.5). Among JAG1-regulated genes identified, cyclin D1 was found to be a direct target of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3. We show that JAG1 down-regulation reduces direct binding of Notch to the cyclin D1 promoter, reduced cyclin D1 expression and inhibition of cell cycle progression through the cyclin D1-dependant G1/S checkpoint. Furthermore, we show that cyclin D1 and JAG1 expression correlate in TN breast cancer expression datasets. These data suggest a model whereby JAG1 promotes cyclin D1-mediated proliferation of TN breast cancers.</docText>

        <docTitle>Fifteen-year trends in metastatic breast cancer survival in Greece.</docTitle>
        <docText>Fifteen-year trends in metastatic breast cancer survival in Greece.

In the metastatic setting, a detected time trend to improved prognosis could be attributed to the corresponding recent advances in the therapeutic approaches. The aim of the current study was to first assess, in a large cohort of well over a thousand patients, the time trends in survival in MBC for the last 15 years and second to explore its association to prognostic factors affecting outcome including therapeutic regimen. This meta-analysis uses individual patient data collected from all the trials on MBC (6 nonrandomized, 4 randomized) conducted by HeCOG from 1991 through 2006. Four 4-year time periods (1991-1994, 1995-1998, 1999-2002, and 2003-2006) were constructed for exploration of time trends in survival according to the patient's date of metastatic diagnosis. Different first line regimens in the 10 trials include anthracycline monotherapy (epirubicin, in the early 1990s) and taxane-containing regimens either as monotherapy or in different combinations with anthracyclines or other drugs. In two phase II studies and in the last randomized study, trastuzumab was administered in all the patients with HER2 overexpressing tumors. In this study, information is based on a total of 1361 patients with a median follow up of 3.7 years and median survival of 1.9 years (median survival 1.28, 1.68, 2.20, and 2.57 years for 1991-1994, 1995-1998, 1999-2002, and 2003-2006, respectively). Survival improved significantly across diagnosis time periods, by 25, 44, and 51%, respectively, in each time period (1995-1998: HR = 0.75, P = 0.004; 1999-2002: HR = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001; 2003-2006: HR = 0.49, P &lt; 0.001) as compared to the first time period (1991-1994). The effect of metastatic diagnosis time period remains almost unchanged in the presence of the following significant prognostic factors: performance status, hormonal receptor status, previous adjuvant chemotherapy, previous adjuvant hormonal treatment, visceral metastasis at entry, and number of metastatic sites. When exploring the effect of new systemic treatment introduction, taking into account the same significant prognostic factors, the effect of diagnosis time period disappears, and the survival improvement is explained directly by the introduction of new agents (hormonal treatment for metastatic disease: yes vs. no: HR = 0.72, P &lt; 0.001; taxanes at first line: yes vs. no: HR = 0.69, P = 0.002; trastuzumab at first line: yes vs. no: HR = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001). The results of this study provide significant evidence of improvement in prognosis of MBC patients within the last 15 years, taking into account all the important significant prognostic factors, and this improvement can be attributed to the use of new systemic treatment agents in the management of the disease.</docText>

        <docText>Active, but not passive cigarette smoking was inversely associated with mammographic density.

PURPOSE: The opposing carcinogenic and antiestrogenic properties of tobacco smoke may explain why epidemiologic studies have not consistently reported positive associations for active smoking and breast cancer risk. A negative relation between mammographic density, a strong breast cancer risk factor, and active smoking would lend support for an antiestrogenic mechanism. METHODS: We used multivariable linear regression to assess the associations of active smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure with mammographic density in 799 pre- and early perimenopausal women in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). RESULTS: We observed that current active smoking was associated with 7.2% lower mammographic density, compared to never active smoking and no SHS exposure (p = 0.02). Starting to smoke before 18 years of age and having smoked &gt;/=20 cigarettes/day were also associated with statistically significantly lower percent densities. Among nulliparous women having smoked &gt;/=20 cigarettes/day was associated with 23.8% lower density, compared to having smoked &lt;/=9 cigarettes/day (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that tobacco smoke exerts an antiestrogenic effect on breast tissue, but counters the known increased risk of breast cancer with smoking prior to first full-term birth. Thus, our data suggest that the antiestrogenic but not the carcinogenic effects of smoking may be reflected by breast density.</docText>

        <docText>Aptamer-biotin-streptavidin-C1q complexes can trigger the classical complement pathway to kill cancer cells.

Nucleic acid aptamers are regarded as rivals for antibodies and as such are being investigated for their therapeutic potential. In the present work, it is shown that two different high-affinity DNA aptamers developed previously by Ferreira et al. against MUC1 antigen (designated MUC1-5TR-1 and MUC1-S1.3/S2.2) on MCF7 breast cancer cells can be linked to the first component of complement (C1q) via a biotin-streptavidin system and induce significant killing of MCF7 cells in vitro. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue uptake and absorbance at 590 nm of stained cells following buffer washes and lysis in 1% SDS. While the killing effect is demonstrable versus various controls, dependent on aptamer dose, and reproducible, it appears to kill maximally about half of treated MCF7 cells. Possible reasons for the marginal killing effect include antigenic shedding in vitro and membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) on the cell surface such as CD46, CD55, and CD59 which act to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of cells. Future in vitro research could benefit from application of mCRP-specific aptamers in combination with anti-MUC1 aptamers to overcome surface protective mechanisms while attacking the plasma membrane of MCF7 cells or other MUC1-expressing cancer cells. However, in vivo such a combination could have deleterious effects on normal MUC1-expressing cells as well.</docText>

        <docTitle>Avoiding Axillary Treatment in Sentinel Lymph Node Micrometastases of Breast Cancer: A Prospective Analysis of Axillary or Distant Recurrence.</docTitle>
        <docText>Avoiding Axillary Treatment in Sentinel Lymph Node Micrometastases of Breast Cancer: A Prospective Analysis of Axillary or Distant Recurrence.

BACKGROUND: The need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) micrometastases remains controversial. The aims of the study were to evaluate the locoregional failure and outcome of breast cancer patients with sentinel node micrometastases who did not undergo completion ALND. METHODS: Between November 2000 and December 2006, SLN biopsy was successfully performed in 1178 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Only patients with macrometastasis (&gt;2 mm) underwent ALND, while patients with negative SLN or micrometastases did not undergo further treatment of the axilla, by either surgery or radiotherapy. Regarding adjuvant therapy decision, patients with SLN-micrometastases (pN1(mi)) were considered as node-positive patients. RESULTS: Of 1,178 patients, 59 (5%) had micrometastases. Of those with micrometastases, 14 (24%) underwent ALND because the intraoperative study of the SLN yielded a positive result. With a median follow-up of 60 (range, 8-94) months, none of the patients with SLN micrometastases in whom ALND was omitted developed an axillary recurrence, while one patient in whom ALND was performed developed infraclavicular lymph node recurrence. One patient, who declined postoperative breast irradiation, developed breast recurrence and distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients with SLN micrometastases in whom ALND was omitted had a very low locoregional failure rate. This study supports the theory that ALND might be avoided in these patients, providing that adjuvant systemic treatment equal to treatment provided to treat node-positive disease is administered. However, longer follow-up and results of additional prospective studies are needed.</docText>

        <docTitle>Differential role of human choline kinase alpha and beta enzymes in lipid metabolism: implications in cancer onset and treatment.</docTitle>
        <docText>Differential role of human choline kinase alpha and beta enzymes in lipid metabolism: implications in cancer onset and treatment.

BACKGROUND: The Kennedy pathway generates phosphocoline and phosphoethanolamine through its two branches. Choline Kinase (ChoK) is the first enzyme of the Kennedy branch of synthesis of phosphocholine, the major component of the plasma membrane. ChoK family of proteins is composed by ChoKalpha and ChoKbeta isoforms, the first one with two different variants of splicing. Recently ChoKalpha has been implicated in the carcinogenic process, since it is over-expressed in a variety of human cancers. However, no evidence for a role of ChoKbeta in carcinogenesis has been reported. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we compare the in vitro and in vivo properties of ChoKalpha1 and ChoKbeta in lipid metabolism, and their potential role in carcinogenesis. Both ChoKalpha1 and ChoKbeta showed choline and ethanolamine kinase activities when assayed in cell extracts, though with different affinity for their substrates. However, they behave differentially when overexpressed in whole cells. Whereas ChoKbeta display an ethanolamine kinase role, ChoKalpha1 present a dual choline/ethanolamine kinase role, suggesting the involvement of each ChoK isoform in distinct biochemical pathways under in vivo conditions. In addition, while overexpression of ChoKalpha1 is oncogenic when overexpressed in HEK293T or MDCK cells, ChoKbeta overexpression is not sufficient to induce in vitro cell transformation nor in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, a significant upregulation of ChoKalpha1 mRNA levels in a panel of breast and lung cancer cell lines was found, but no changes in ChoKbeta mRNA levels were observed. Finally, MN58b, a previously described potent inhibitor of ChoK with in vivo antitumoral activity, shows more than 20-fold higher efficiency towards ChoKalpha1 than ChoKbeta. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first evidence of the distinct metabolic role of ChoKalpha and ChoKbeta isoforms, suggesting different physiological roles and implications in human carcinogenesis. These findings constitute a step forward in the design of an antitumoral strategy based on ChoK inhibition.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cooperativity of the MUC1 oncoprotein and STAT1 pathway in poor prognosis human breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cooperativity of the MUC1 oncoprotein and STAT1 pathway in poor prognosis human breast cancer.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is activated in the inflammatory response to interferons. The MUC1 oncoprotein is overexpressed in human breast cancers. Analysis of genes differentially expressed in MUC1-transformed cells has identified a network linking MUC1 and STAT1 that is associated with cellular growth and inflammation. The results further show that the MUC1-C subunit associates with STAT1 in cells and the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain binds directly to the STAT1 DNA-binding domain. The interaction between MUC1-C and STAT1 is inducible by IFNgamma in non-malignant epithelial cells and constitutive in breast cancer cells. Moreover, the MUC1-STAT1 interaction contributes to the activation of STAT1 target genes, including MUC1 itself. Analysis of two independent databases showed that MUC1 and STAT1 are coexpressed in about 15% of primary human breast tumors. Coexpression of MUC1 and the STAT1 pathway was found to be significantly associated with decreased recurrence-free and overall survival. These findings indicate that (i) MUC1 and STAT1 function in an auto-inductive loop, and (ii) activation of both MUC1 and the STAT1 pathway in breast tumors confers a poor prognosis for patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 16 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.391.</docText>

        <docText>In vivo magnetic enrichment and multiplex photoacoustic detection of circulating tumour cells.

The spread of cancer cells between organs, a process known as metastasis, is the cause of most cancer deaths. Detecting circulating tumour cells-a common marker for the development of metastasis-is difficult because ex vivo methods are not sensitive enough owing to limited blood sample volume and in vivo diagnosis is time-consuming as large volumes of blood must be analysed. Here, we show a way to magnetically capture circulating tumour cells in the bloodstream of mice followed by rapid photoacoustic detection. Magnetic nanoparticles, which were functionalized to target a receptor commonly found in breast cancer cells, bound and captured circulating tumour cells under a magnet. To improve detection sensitivity and specificity, gold-plated carbon nanotubes conjugated with folic acid were used as a second contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging. By integrating in vivo multiplex targeting, magnetic enrichment, signal amplification and multicolour recognition, our approach allows circulating tumour cells to be concentrated from a large volume of blood in the vessels of tumour-bearing mice, and this could have potential for the early diagnosis of cancer and the prevention of metastasis in humans.</docText>

        <docText>Processes Inherent in Mammography-Screening Decisions of Rarely or Never-Screened Women.

Breast cancer is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. A strong association exists between survival and early detection through regular mammography. Impoverished women underuse this life-saving screening, resulting in a disproportionate cancer burden. The study purpose is to discover the process of rarely or never-screened women's mammography-screening decisions. The sample consists of five rural, low-income, uninsured, and rarely or never-screened women. Grounded theory methodology is used to generate a new theoretical explanation of mammography-screening decision making. Findings include the central conceptual categories, intuitive dominance and intuitive certainty, which contribute toward an intuitive decision-making default. This intuitive thinking style weaves throughout two interrelated categories: (a) scarce, supportive, relational resources for learning and (b) dichotomous health care-seeking behaviors. Implications focus on a nontraditional client assessment whereby nurses can facilitate relational-based knowledge construction. Recommendations for future research include examination of the process of integrating intuition with reasoned thought for more fully informed decisions.</docText>

        <docText>The cleavage of semaphorin 3C induced by ADAMTS1 promotes cell migration.

Metastasis is a sequential process that allows cells to move from the primary tumor and grow elsewhere. Because of their ability to cleave a variety of extracellular signaling and adhesion molecules, metalloproteases have been long considered key components of the metastatic program. However, the function of certain metalloproteases, such as ADAMTS1, is not clear and seems to depend on the cellular environment and/or the stage of tumor progression. In order to characterize the function of ADAMTS1, we performed two alternative proteomic approaches, Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) and Stable Isotopes Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC), to identify novel substrates of the metalloprotease. Both techniques showed that overexpression of ADAMTS1 leads to the release of semaphorin 3C from the extracellular matrix. Although semaphorins are well- known regulators of axon guidance, accumulating evidence shows that they may also participate in tumor progression. Here, we show that the cleavage of semaphorin 3C induced by ADAMTS1 promotes the migration of breast cancer cells, indicating that the co-expression of these molecules in tumors may contribute to the metastatic program.</docText>

        <docText>Breast-Specific {gamma}-Imaging: Molecular Imaging of the Breast Using 99mTc-Sestamibi and a Small-Field-of-View {gamma}-Camera.

Breast-specific gamma-imaging (BSGI), also known as molecular breast imaging, is breast scintigraphy using a small-field-of-view gamma-camera and (99m)Tc-sestamibi. There are many different types of breast cancer, and many have characteristics making them challenging to detect by mammography and ultrasound. BSGI is a cost-effective, highly sensitive and specific technique that complements other imaging modalities currently being used to identify malignant lesions in the breast. Using the current Society of Nuclear Medicine guidelines for breast scintigraphy, Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital began conducting BSGI, breast scintigraphy with a breast-optimized gamma-camera. In our experience, optimal imaging has been conducted in the Breast Center by a nuclear medicine technologist. In addition, the breast radiologists read the BSGI images in correlation with the mammograms, ultrasounds, and other imaging studies performed. By modifying the current Society of Nuclear Medicine protocol to adapt it to the practice of breast scintigraphy with these new systems and by providing image interpretation in conjunction with the other breast imaging studies, our center has found BSGI to be a valuable adjunctive procedure in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The development of a small-field-of-view gamma-camera, designed to optimize breast imaging, has resulted in improved detection capabilities, particularly for lesions less than 1 cm. Our experience with this procedure has proven to aid in the clinical work-up of many of our breast patients. After reading this article, the reader should understand the history of breast scintigraphy, the pharmaceutical used, patient preparation and positioning, imaging protocol guidelines, clinical indications, and the role of breast scintigraphy in breast cancer diagnosis.</docText>

        <docTitle>Targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80-85% of all cases of lung cancer, and it is the most common cause of death in men and second only to breast cancer in women. Combination chemotherapy, usually platinum-based, is currently the first-line therapy of choice, however, the prognosis for patients with advanced NSCLC remains poor with a median survival time of 8-11 months and a 1-year survival rate of 30%. The treatment of NSCLC is therefore a major unmet need and new therapies focusing on the molecular mechanisms that mediate growth of NSCLC cells are urgently needed. The availability of agents targeted against the EGF-R, as well as the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab, have provided some clinical benefit. Numerous other novel targeted therapies are now in clinical development and may have potential for overcoming the limitations associated with currently available drugs. In addition, a few new agents targeting novel pathways are also under clinical evaluation. The search for innovative therapeutic agents in NSCLC that are more effective and have fewer side effects than older chemotherapeutic drugs has spurred the development of more than 500 molecularly targeted agents and thereby has introduced the concept of individualized therapy. In this article we review clinical data for molecular-targeted therapies in NSCLC, with emphasis on EGF-R, VEGF-R and other novel targets. Nonetheless, for most patients with NSCLC targeted therapies have not dramatically changed clinical outcome, and resistance has emerged as a clinical problem. The molecular complexity of lung cancer underlies these disappointments and stresses the need for optimizing treatment by seeking a more personalized approach to care. Therefore, clinical trials that investigate the activity of novel agents, and incorporate patient selection based on clinical and molecular factors, are required. The increased sophistication of preclinical models and the enrollment of patients in clinical trials that include measurements of biomarkers will clearly help to identify patients who are likely to benefit from therapy, as well as further define mechanisms of resistance to therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Randomized clinical trials in breast cancer.

Breast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in this group. Significant advances in the treatment of breast cancer and in the ability to screen for the disease mean that it is also one of the most curable forms of cancer. Long-term updates of the trials reviewed in the previous edition of this article have demonstrated that breast-conserving therapy remains a viable option for most patients, and that local control is related to overall survival. New chemotherapeutic options and endocrine therapies are available to select subsets of patients, and the use of endocrine therapy in breast cancer prevention has been shown to be of clear benefit. The sheer number of breast cancer-related randomized, controlled trials makes it impossible to review all level Ia evidence in this article but, where possible, extensive referencing and tabular review of related trials are used to provide the reader with a clear outline of the central data dictating current standard of care.</docText>

        <docText>Gene Expression Profiling Studies of Three SERMs and Their Conjugated Estrogen Combinations in Human Breast Cancer Cells: Insights into the Unique Antagonistic Effects of Bazedoxifene on Conjugated Estrogens.

Bazedoxifene (BZA), a new selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) was recently approved in Europe for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Combination therapy using BZA and conjugated estrogens (CE) is currently in late stage development representing a new paradigm for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis. A GeneChip microarray study was designed to compare gene expression profiles of BZA to that of other SERMs, raloxifene (RAL) and lasofoxifene (LAS). In addition, we compared the gene expression profiles of the three SERMs in combination with CE, a mixture of 10 most abundant estrogens present in Premarin. According to the hierarchical clustering heat map analysis, gene clusters that specifically responded to CE treatments or SERM treatments were identified and gene lists sorted based on a set of cutoff filters. A group of genes differentially regulated by CE were also identified to be antagonized by BZA when comparing CE with the BZA+CE treatment. All three SERMs showed significant antagonistic effect against CE-stimulated cell proliferation, based on the MCF-7 cell proliferation assay and GeneChip data, with the order of antagonist activity being BZA&gt;RAL&gt;LAS. These results indicate that SERMs in combination with CE exhibit differential pharmacology, and therefore, combinations of other SERMs and estrogen preparations may not yield the same effects that are observed in clinic by pairing BZA with CE.</docText>

        <docText>The clinical implications of MMP-11 and CK-20 expression in human breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Tumor invasiveness and metastasis in cancer progression is manifested by epigenetic abnormality. However, it remains unknown whether transcription regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-11(MMP-11) and cytoskeleton-20 (CK-20) genes for the homoeostasis of epithelial/connective interface that can enhance cell dissemination and invasion may act as alternative mutators to tumor clinicopathology. METHODS: Paired cancerous and tumor-adjacent normal tissues from 72 breast cancer patients were assayed for the expression of MMP-11 and CK-20 by using real-time RT-PCR. The expression profiles were evaluated for the association with clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: Breast tumor tissues displayed higher expression levels of MMP-11 and CK-20 than those of the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Overexpression of either MMP-11 or CK-20 correlated with patients having poorly differentiated tumors (P(MMP-11)=0.01 and P(CK-20)=0.05) and lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P(MMP-11)=0.004 and P(CK-20)=0.001). A synergistic effect between MMP-11 and CK-20 on risk elevation was significant in patients with advanced tumor stage (OR=2.03, 95%CI=1.10-3.77) and LNM (OR=2.83, 95%CI=1.20-4.71). Additionally, patients lacking progesterone receptor exhibited high expression of MMP-11 and CK-20. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that MMP-11 and CK-20 are probable prognostic markers whose expression reflects the stages of tumor differentiation and LNM of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Cytotoxicity, intracellular distribution and uptake of doxorubicin and doxorubicin coupled to cell-penetrating peptides in different cell lines: A comparative study.

One of the major obstacles which are opposed to the success of anticancer treatment is the cell resistance that generally develops after administration of commonly used drugs. In this study, we try to overcome the tumour cell resistance of doxorubicin (Dox) by developing a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-anticancer drug conjugate in aim to enhance its intracellular delivery and that its therapeutic effects. For this purpose, two cell-penetrating peptides, penetratin (pene) and tat, derived from the HIV-1 TAT protein, were chemically conjugated to Dox. The cytotoxicity, intracellular distribution and uptake were accessed in CHO cells (Chinese Hamster Ovarian carcinoma cells), HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells), differentiated NG108.15 neuronal cell and breast cancer cells MCF7drug-sensitive or MDA-MB 231 drug-resistant cell lines. The conjugates showed different cell killing activity and intracellular distribution pattern by comparison to Dox as assessed respectively by MTT-based colorimetric cellular cytotoxicity assay, confocal fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis. After treatment with 3muM with Dox-CPPs for 2h, pene increase the Dox cytotoxicity by 7.19-fold in CHO cells, by 11.53-fold in HUVEC cells and by 4.87-fold in MDA-MB 231 cells. However, cytotoxicity was decreased in NG108.15 cells and MCF7. Our CPPs-Dox conjugate proves the validity of CPPs for the cytoplasmic delivery of therapeutically useful molecules and also a valuable strategy to overcome drug resistance.</docText>

        <docText>Translational breast cancer research: Recent advances through the lens of experimental radiotherapy.

Enormous efforts are currently put forth in translational breast cancer research. These efforts are directed to both the development of new drugs and the implementation of novel techniques of local treatment, including radiotherapy. This latter discipline is actually a particularly fertile ground for translational research, since scientists and clinicians are developing novel tools in biology and radiation physics, which reduce the gap between the lab and the clinic, and identify innovative strategies that one didn't even dream, only a few years ago. Nowadays the most recent advances in translational breast cancer research are articulated, in radiation science, around three main domains, namely molecular biology, experimental models for tumour growth and response to treatment, and mechanisms underlying levels of malignant and normal cell radio-sensitivity/radio-resistance. In an attempt to put into perspective what could be the breast cancer radiotherapy of the next decade, these three domains are reviewed and discussed in the present article, at the light of ongoing, "from bench to bedside" studies.</docText>

        <docText>Organizing Pneumonia Associated with the Use of Trastuzumab.

Organizing pneumonia is a clinical and histological condition in which the onset is usually subacute with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates. It may be unknown origin (cryptogenic) or associated with other illnesses, infectious diseases or drugs. We present a 60 year-old female patient with a previous history of breast cancer, who was being treated with trastuzumab, an antiHER2 monoclonal antibody. She was diagnosed with casual pulmonary infiltrates that had histological changes compatible with organizing pneumonia. The pulmonary infiltrates disappeared on withdrawing trastuzumab treatment. Due to the increasing use of biological therapies in different medical areas, we believe it is of interest to report this pulmonary involvement attributed to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab.</docText>

        <docText>Mucin-interacting proteins: from function to therapeutics.

Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins that are involved in regulating diverse cellular activities both in normal and pathological conditions. Mucin activity and localization is mediated by several molecular mechanisms, including discrete interactions with other proteins. An understanding of the biochemistry behind the known interactions between mucins and other proteins, coupled with an appreciation of their pathophysiological significance, can lend insight into the development of novel therapeutic agents. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that a cell permeable inhibitor, PMIP, that disrupts the MUC1-EGFR interaction, is effective in killing breast cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models.</docText>

        <docText>Factors contributing to improved local control after mastectomy in patients with breast cancer aged 40 years or younger.

Long-term local control rates were studied in a series of 659 patients with invasive breast cancer aged 40 years or younger, who underwent mastectomy in general hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands between 1988 and 2005. During a median follow-up time of 6.0 years, 34 patients developed a local recurrence in the chest wall without previous or simultaneous evidence of distant disease. The 5- and 10-year actuarial local recurrence rates for the total group were 5.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.5-7.7%) and 7.3% (95% CI, 4.7-9.9%), respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that patients receiving radiotherapy (hazards ratio [HR], 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.96) or adjuvant systemic treatment (HR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08-0.65) had a significantly lower risk of local recurrence. It is concluded that excellent local control rates can be obtained with mastectomy in young women with breast cancer, especially in those who receive adjuvant systemic treatment and/or radiotherapy.</docText>

        <docText>Pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy before sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer.

Pre-operative lymphoscintigram for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may not be required for successful SLNB. The 117 consecutive patients who underwent SLNB had pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy. The operating surgeon was blinded to the results of the lymphoscintigram before SLNB. After SLNB was complete, the surgeon was unblinded to the results of the lymphoscintigram; re-exploration carried out if more nodes were predicted on the lymphoscintigram. 116 patients (99%) had successful SLNB before unblinding. In 85 patients (73%), operative findings corresponded with scintigraphic findings. In 26 patients (22%), the lymphoscintigram predicted more sentinel nodes than had been found; further nodes were identified and excised in only 4 patients (3%). None were positive for cancer. SLNB was successful in 99% of cases without pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy. Only 3% of patients had further nodes identified as a result of the lymphoscintigram. Pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy does not improve the ability to perform axillary SLNB during breast cancer surgery.</docText>

        <docText>Bilayer disruption and liposome restructuring by a homologous series of small Arg-rich synthetic peptides.

The effects of a series of low molecular weight water-soluble cationic linear peptide analogs (LPAs, &lt;1000 MW) with increasing hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on lipid bilayer phase behavior and permeability were examined using liposomes composed of zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and mixed zwitterionic/anionic DPPC/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) lipid bilayers. LPAs were synthesized using a previously reported alkyl linkage strategy as Arg-C(n)-Arg-C(n)-Lys, where C(n) represents the saturated alkyl linkage separating the cationic residues (n=4, 7, or 11) (Ye et al., 2007 [1]). Differential scanning calorimetry results show that the cationic LPAs bound to and disrupted DPPC and, to a greater extent, DPPC/DPPG phase behavior. When added to preformed unilamellar liposomes, the LPAs led to significant structural changes based on cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Coupling cryo-TEM with carboxyfluorescein leakage studies indicate that the LPAs induced permeabilization through bilayer expansion, which caused membrane thinning. The effects were inconsistent with increasing LPA hydrophobicity, which suggests that a cooperative effect between electrostatic binding and hydrophobic insertion determined the location of LPAs within the bilayer and their membrane activity. Our results for LPA-induced membrane disruption correlate with previous breast cancer cell uptake studies that showed minimal LPA-C(4) uptake, but high LPA-C(11) uptake through a non-endocytic mechanism.</docText>

        <docText>RNAi-mediated down-regulation of alpha-actinin-4 decreases invasion potential in oral squamous cell carcinoma.

alpha-actinin-4, originally identified as an actin-binding protein associated with cell motility, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells, appears to be overexpressed in various human epithelial carcinomas, including colorectal, breast, esophageal, ovarian, and non-small cell lung carcinomas. The authors evaluated whether alpha-actinin-4 might be appropriate as a molecular target for cancer gene therapy. In 64 primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and 10 normal oral mucosal specimens, and in seven human OSCC cell lines, alpha-actinin-4 expression was evaluated immunologically and correlations with clinicopathologic factors were examined. Overexpression of alpha-actinin-4 was detected in 38 of 64 oral squamous cell carcinomas (70%); significantly more frequently than in normal oral mucosa. The expression of alpha-actinin-4 was significantly associated with invasion potential defined by the Matrigel invasion assay. Cancer cell lines with higher alpha-actinin-4 expression had greater invasive potential. An RNAi-mediated decrease in alpha-actinin-4 expression reduced the invasion potential. These results indicated that the overexpression of alpha-actinin-4 was associated with an aggressive phenotype of OSCC. The study indicated that alpha-actinin-4 could be a potential molecular target for gene therapy by RNAi targeting for OSCC.</docText>

        <docText>Speckle reduction approach for breast ultrasound image and its application to breast cancer diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate the effects of a speckle reduction algorithm on radiologists' diagnosis of malignant and benign breast lesions on ultrasound (US) images. METHODS: Using a database of 603 breast (US) images of 211 cases (109 benign lesions and 102 malignant ones), the original and speckle-reduced images were assessed by five radiologists and final assessment categories were assigned to indicate the probability of malignancy according to BI-RADS-US. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were investigated by the areas (Az) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of breast lesions on Ultrasound images improved from 88.7% to 94.3%, from 68.6% to 75.2%, respectively, and the area (Az) under ROC curve of diagnosis also increased from 0.843 to 0.939, Z=4.969, there were significant differences in the Az between the original breast lesions and speckle-reduced ones on Ultrasound images (P&lt;0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of breast lesions had been highly improved from 78.67% to 92.73% after employing this algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed speckle reduction algorithm in distinguishing malignant from benign breast lesions which will be useful for breast cancer diagnosis.</docText>

        <docText>Marchantin A, a cyclic bis(bibenzyl ether), isolated from the liverwort Marchantia emarginata subsp. tosana induces apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Liverwort constituents have been reported to exert a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this study, we used a bioactivity-guided separation of an extract from the liverwort species Marchantia emarginata subsp. tosana to determine its anticancer activity. A high level of the active ingredient was isolated from this liverwort and its chemical structure was identified and characterized by various spectra. It was found to be identical to a well-known compound, marchantin A, a cyclic bisbibenzyl ether. However, no anticancer activities of this compound have previously been reported. We found that marchantin A efficiently induced cell growth inhibition in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with an IC(50) of 4.0mug/mL. Fluorescence microscopy and a Western blot analysis indicated that marchantin A actively induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. The levels of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) increased. However, the level of Bid markedly decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also evaluated the anticancer activities of marchantin A on the regulation of cell cycle regulators such as p21, p27, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1. The p21 and p27 gene expressions increased markedly while cyclin B1 and D1 gene expression decreased markedly by treatment with marchantin A. Many report demonstrated that liverwort was suggested to possess potent antioxidant activity. Our results indicate that marchantin A possesses free radical-scavenging activity (EC(50)=20mug/mL). Taken together, for the first time, the compound marchantin A from liverworts demonstrated to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.</docText>

        <docTitle>Elevated expression of phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in basal-like and "triple-negative" breast cancers.</docTitle>
        <docText>Elevated expression of phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in basal-like and "triple-negative" breast cancers.

Basal-like carcinomas and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) overexpression carcinomas are the subgroups of breast cancers that have the most aggressive clinical behavior. Phosphorylation/activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase is characterized as a stress-activated protein kinase, which regulates apoptosis after cellular stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase expression with phenotypes and clinicopathologic parameters of breast cancer. Phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase was immunohistochemically measured in a cohort of 160 patients with invasive breast cancer treated with therapeutic surgery followed by anthracycline or docetaxel-based chemotherapy. These results were further correlated with the phenotypes and clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancers. Increased phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase expression was significantly associated with lack of estrogen receptor expression (P &lt; .0001), positivity for cytokeratins 5/6 (P = .029), epidermal growth factor receptor (P = .035), basal-like phenotype (P = .015), and "triple-negative" phenotype (P = .01). Furthermore, the positive expression of phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase was positively correlated with p-glycoprotein (r = 0.54, P &lt; .0001) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1(r = 0.38, P &lt; .0001) but not with lung resistance protein (r = -0.02, P = .78). Our results indicate that the activation of phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase may play a role in the carcinogenesis of basal-like and triple-negative breast carcinoma.</docText>

        <docText>Radiofrequency ablation of breast carcinomas: preliminary results of a clinical trial.

OBJECTIVE: Among the alternatives to breast conserving surgery in breast cancer, radiofrequency ablation is the most widespread. We aimed to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this technique in our environment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed radiofrequency ablation of breast carcinomas under local anesthesia in the ultrasonography examination room. We included 35 patients (mean age=61.2+/-8.25 years) with invasive carcinomas measuring less than 2cm (mean diameter=8.9+/-2.9mm) and located far from the skin and chest wall. Prior to radiofrequency treatment, all patients underwent core biopsy to confirm that the tumors were invasive carcinomas and selective lymphadenectomy. Carcinomas were excised 2 to 4 weeks after radiofrequency treatment and analyzed histologically to evaluate the effects of radiofrequency treatment on the tumor and surrounding tissue. The degree of coagulation necrosis and involvement of the margins was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Cellular viability or effectiveness of the radiofrequency treatment was evaluated using NADH diaphorase. RESULTS: In total, 85.7% of patients reported no discomfort; 11.4% reported mild, controllable pain. Intense pain required the procedure to be discontinued in one patient. No other complications occurred. Signs of coagulation necrosis were observed in all cases; coagulation necrosis was classified as complete in 32/35 (91.4%). NADH diaphorase was negative in 27 of the 32 cases in which it was performed; one case was slightly positive and the other four were impossible to evaluate. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation of breast carcinomas is feasible, well tolerated, safe, and efficacious in nearly 90% of invasive tumors. The efficacy of the technique should be confirmed through extended follow-up of patients without subsequent surgical intervention in carefully designed and monitored phase III trials.</docText>

        <docText>Hantupeptins B and C, cytotoxic cyclodepsipeptides from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula.

Hantupeptins B (2) and C (3) were isolated, along with the previously reported hantupeptin A (1), from the marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya majuscula, collected from Pulau Hantu Besar, Singapore. Their structures were elucidated by interpretation of extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data. Compounds 2 and 3 are cyclic depsipeptides consisting of five alpha-amino/hydroxy acid residues, including phenyllactic acid, proline, N-methyl-valine, valine, N-methyl-isoleucine, and a beta-hydroxy acid unit with different degrees of unsaturation at the terminal end of each molecule. The absolute configurations of the common amino acids and phenyllactic acid were determined by the advanced Marfey's and chiral HPLC analyses, respectively. The complete stereochemistry of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-7-octynoic acid moiety in hantupeptin A was elucidated by a combination of homonuclear J-resolved 2D NMR experiments and by Mosher's method. Hantupeptins B and C showed moderate in vitro cytotoxicity when tested against MOLT-4 (leukemic) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines.</docText>

        <docTitle>Survivorship: adult cancer survivors.</docTitle>
        <docText>Survivorship: adult cancer survivors.

During the next decade, a rapid increase in the number of new cancer diagnoses in the population as well as a growing number of cancer survivors can be expected. Cancer is anticipated to exceed cardiovascular disease as the primary cause of mortality in the United States population. Despite efforts in tobacco control, the aging of the population and obesity epidemic will contribute toward the increasing incidence of cancer. Although oncology specialists will continue to play a critical role in the diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with cancer, primary care providers will need to play an expanding role in the early detection of cancer, as well as the follow-up, health promotion, and cancer surveillance that will be necessary after initial cancer treatment. Oncology specialists will need to do a better job coordinating the care of their patients with primary care providers, and work toward a shared care model that will optimize the quality of care delivered by the health care system. Cancer treatment summaries and survivorship care plans are an initial attempt to address the current fragmentation and lack of coordination in care that exist today. Cancer survivors are at risk for a wide range of late effects after their primary cancer treatment. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the exact incidence and prevalence of many physical late effects. For example, how many women given standard adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer at age 35 years will develop permanent amenorrhea after treatment, and be infertile? What is the excess risk of osteoporosis in a 70-year-old man receiving endocrine therapy for prostate cancer? What is the risk of coronary artery disease after mantle irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma? Because of the limited database for many of these sequelae of treatment, clinicians have to keep all of these potential risks in mind as they interview a survivor, and develop a long-term management plan that focuses on symptomatic management and future chronic disease prevention. Until one has a better sense of the natural history of these late sequelae, as well as better information about who is at risk, focusing on a taking a cancer survivor-directed medical history may be the best detection tool that is available. Drawing on a shared care model, primary care providers should collaborate with oncology specialists to determine if cancer-specific laboratory and radiographic studies are indicated to determine if the patient has a cancer treatment-related late effect or cancer recurrence. Health promotion and aggressive management of comorbid conditions should be a standard of care for cancer survivors, as with other patients in the primary care practice. With the growing number of cancer survivors, as well as the recommendations of the IOM report directing research and policy on this subject (see Box 1), it is hoped that in the future a better evidence base to direct health care management in cancer survivors will be built up.</docText>

        <docText>Diagnosing cancer in the symptomatic patient.

Finding cancer at its earliest, most treatable stage gives patients the greatest chance of survival. For a number of cancers, screening tests allow for early detection and treatment, and thereby, reduce cancer-related mortality. However, many cancers are discovered by symptomatic presentation rather than screening. This article addresses several symptoms commonly reported in the primary care setting, including rectal bleeding, a breast lump, cough, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss, and offers an evidence-based approach to the consideration and possibly the diagnosis of cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Diagnosis of breast cancer at dynamic MRI in patients with breast augmentation by paraffin or silicone injection.

AIM: To determine the diagnostic performance of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for breast cancer in breasts augmented with liquid paraffin or silicone injection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 62 patients with breast augmentation by liquid paraffin or silicone injection who had undergone dynamic breast MRI at our institution, 27 women, who had pathological diagnosis or at least 1-year MRI follow-up, were included in this retrospective study and their MRI images were reviewed. For enhancing lesions on MRI, the morphological features, enhancement kinetics, and BI-RADS assessment category were analysed. The lesion characteristics at MRI were correlated with the final diagnosis based on the histopathological result or at least 1-year MRI follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 17 enhancing lesions in 13 patients were found on MRI. All six lesions that were confirmed as malignancy showed suspicious morphological findings and type 2 or 3 enhancement kinetics, assigned to BI-RADS category 4 or 5. Of the remaining 11 benign lesions, 10 showed benign-favouring morphological findings, and all showed type 1 enhancement kinetics, assigned to BI-RADS category 2 or 4. CONCLUSION: In patients with breasts injected with foreign material, MRI was used to successfully diagnose malignant breast lesions and could be the diagnostic method of choice. Analysis of the morphological and kinetic features at MRI in conjunction with clinical findings is essential.</docText>

        <docText>Can breast MRI computer-aided detection (CAD) improve radiologist accuracy for lesions detected at MRI screening and recommended for biopsy in a high-risk population?

AIM: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) computer-aided detection (CAD) for breast MRI screen-detected lesions recommended for biopsy in a high-risk population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3-5 lesions with histopathological correlation [nine invasive cancers, 13 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 34 benign] were retrospectively evaluated using a breast MRI CAD prototype (CAD-Gaea). CAD evaluation was performed separately and in consensus by two radiologists specializing in breast imaging, blinded to the histopathology. Thresholds of 50, 80, and 100% and delayed enhancement were independently assessed with CAD. Lesions were rated as malignant or benign according to threshold and delayed enhancement only and in combination. Sensitivities, specificities, and negative predictive values (NPV) were determined for CAD assessments versus pathology. Initial MRI BI-RADS interpretation without CAD versus CAD assessments were compared using paired binary diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Threshold levels for lesion enhancement were: 50% to include all malignant (and all benign) lesions; and 100% for all invasive cancer and high-grade DCIS. Combined use of threshold and enhancement patterns for CAD assessment was best (73% sensitivity, 56% specificity and 76% NPV for all cancer). Sensitivities and NPV were better for invasive cancer (100%/100%) than for all malignancies (54%/76%). Radiologists' MRI interpretation was more sensitive than CAD (p=0.05), but less specific (p=0.001) for cancer detection. CONCLUSION: The breast MRI CAD system used could not improve the radiologists' accuracy for distinguishing all malignant from benign lesions, due to the poor sensitivity for DCIS detection.</docText>

        <docText>Chemopreventive actions by enterolactone and 13 VIOXX((R))-related lactone derivatives in H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells.

Cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17) has been linked to various hormone-related diseases, including breast cancer, thus being a potential target for cancer chemoprevention. We studied the naturally occurring phytochemical enterolactone (ENL) and 13 VIOXX((R))-related lactone derivatives (CRI-1 to CRI-13) for their effects on CYP17 activity and expression and on cell cycle status in the human H295R adrenocorticocarcinoma cell line. Of the tested compounds, only CRI-3, -7, -10 and -12 showed to be inhibitors of CYP17 activity in H295R cells. This inhibition was not due to decreased mRNA expression, but was apparently caused by post-translational modification of the CYP17 enzyme. The MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 induced CYP17 activity by 24%, while co-incubation of the CRI-s with PD98059, reduced CYP17 activity even further than the reduction caused by the CRI-s alone. In addition, CRI-3, -7, -10 and -12 arrested the cell cycle in the G(2)/M phase. The structure-activity similarities of the CRI-s with known micro-tubule binding agents strongly suggest that cell cycle arrest is a result of interaction with tubulin. We conclude that the proposed cancer chemopreventive actions of ENL are not mediated through interaction with CYP17 or cell cycle status. Of the VIOXX((R))-related lactone derivatives, CRI-7 could prove useful in the prevention of hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast cancer, since in vitro it shows low cytotoxicity, it is a potent inhibitor of CYP17 activity and strong inducer of cell cycle arrest.</docText>

        <docText>Increased ceramide synthase 2 and 6 mRNA levels in breast cancer tissues and correlation with sphingosine kinase expression.

Intervention in the ceramide metabolic pathway is emerging as a novel means to regulate cancer and to modify the activity of chemotherapeutic drugs. We now study mRNA expression levels of the six ceramide synthase (CerS) genes in breast cancer tissue. CerS2 and CerS6 mRNA was significantly elevated in breast cancer tissue compared to paired normal tissue, with approximately half of the individuals showing elevated CerS2 and CerS6 mRNA. A significant correlation was found between CerS2 and CerS6 expression, and between CerS4 and CerS2/CerS6 expression. Moreover, patients that expressed higher CerS2 or 4 mRNA levels tended to show no changes in sphingosine kinase 1 levels, and likewise patients that expressed no change in CerS2 or CerS4 mRNA levels tended to express higher levels of sphingosine kinase 1. Together these results suggest an important role for the CerS genes in breast cancer etiology or diagnosis.</docText>

        <docText>Blood spots as an alternative to whole blood collection and the effect of a small monetary incentive to increase participation in genetic association studies.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Collection of buccal cells from saliva for DNA extraction offers a less invasive and convenient alternative to venipuncture blood collection that may increase participation in genetic epidemiologic studies. However, dried blood spot collection, which is also a convenient method, offers a means of collecting peripheral blood samples from which analytes in addition to DNA can be obtained. METHODS: To determine if offering blood spot collection would increase participation in genetic epidemiologic studies, we conducted a study of collecting dried blood spot cards by mail from a sample of female cancer cases (n = 134) and controls (n = 256) who were previously selected for a breast cancer genetics study and declined to provide a venipuncture blood sample. Participants were also randomized to receive either a $2.00 bill or no incentive with the blood spot collection kits. RESULTS: The average time between the venipuncture sample refusal and recruitment for the blood spot collection was 4.4 years. Thirty-seven percent of cases and 28% of controls provided a dried blood spot card. While the incentive was not associated with participation among controls (29% for $2.00 incentive vs. 26% for no incentive, p = 0.6), it was significantly associated with participation among the breast cancer cases (48% vs. 27%, respectively, p = 0.01). There did not appear to be any bias in response since no differences between cases and controls and incentive groups were observed when examining several demographic, work history and radiation exposure variables. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that collection of dried blood spot cards in addition to venipuncture blood samples may be a feasible method to increase participation in genetic case-control studies.</docText>

        <docText>Degradation of HER2 Receptor Through Hypericin-mediated Photodynamic Therapy.

Abstract Current treatment of breast cancer is often affected by resistance to therapeutics, for which the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) may be responsible. Here, we report for the first time the use of hypericin-mediated photodynamic therapy (HY-PDT) in combination with a selective HER2 inhibitor (AG 825) on SKBR-3, a HER2 overexpressing human breast adenocarcinoma cell line. The results demonstrate that HY-PDT is able to degrade HER2 with an impact on its signaling cascade. Combination with AG 825 resulted in increased apoptosis induction, total degradation of HER2 and inhibition of colony formation. Downregulation of HSP90, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and upregulation of Bax was also observed. This knowledge provides the basis for the possible application of HY-PDT in preclinical and clinical models of breast cancer treatment.</docText>

        <docTitle>Biological role of NHERF1 protein expression in breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Biological role of NHERF1 protein expression in breast cancer.

AIMS: To determine the role of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF1) in breast cancerogenesis and progression. METHODS AND RESULTS: NHERF1 expression was examined in normal tissue, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive carcinoma (IBC), synchronous metastatic lymph node and metachronous distant metastases of a retrospective series of breast cancers. Fifty-one IBC, 42 DCIS and normal tissues were examined immunohistochemically, and the colocalization between NHERF1 and HER2/neu was studied by immunofluorescence. NHERF1 showed a different localization and pattern of expression in the different compartments of the breast. The mean value of cytoplasmic NHERF1 expression in paired samples was significantly higher in DCIS, IBC, distant metastases and metastatic lymph nodes with respect to normal tissues. Moreover, in metastatic lymph nodes NHERF1 was exclusively cytoplasmic. In the membrane NHERF1 was colocalized with overexpressed HER2/neu in DCIS, IBC and distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancerogenesis is characterized by increased cytoplasmic expression of NHERF1 as the tumour progresses, suggesting a role in this process. The switch from apical membranous to cytoplasmic expression is compatible with a dual role for NHERF1 as a tumour suppressor or tumour promoter dependent on its subcellular localization.</docText>

        <docText>Vessel density assessed by endoglin expression in breast carcinomas with different expression profiles.

AIMS: To evaluate the relationship between microvessel density assessed by endoglin expression and the molecular subtypes of human invasive breast carcinomas and whether there is evidence to indicate that angiogenesis could be a putative target for therapy in specific subsets of breast cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a series of 161 breast carcinomas, but information was available on only 142 tumours. We correlated endoglin expression with distinct breast carcinoma subgroups classified according to immunohistochemical profiling. Additionally, we compared it with other biomarkers for the aggressive basal-like subset and with available histopathological data. Although the basal-like subtype has higher microvessel density, there are no significant differences with the other molecular subtypes of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no significant differences in tumour vascularity in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Automated image analysis for high-throughput quantitative detection of ER and PR expression levels in large-scale clinical studies: the TEAM Trial Experience.

AIMS: Routine immunohistochemistry is regarded as a semiquantitative method for the evaluation of in situ protein expression. Analysis of tissue biomarkers in large clinical trials is central to the development of novel targeted approaches to therapy, requires the analysis of tens of thousands of data points, and frequently makes use of high-throughput analysis of tissue microarrays (TMAs). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of image analysis for accurate and reproducible quantitative evaluation of biomarkers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We showed, in 397 cases of breast cancer from the Phase III TEAM clinical trial, excellent correlations between semiautomated image analysis of TMAs and manual scoring of oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels (interclass correlation coefficients 0.93 and 0.96 respectively). Two or more TMA cores were excellently correlated with manual scores, and using more than three cores increased the number of cases available for analysis to &gt;92%. TMAs are confirmed as representative of whole sections for immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue biomarkers ER and PR. CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated image analysis is appropriate for the analysis of tissue biomarkers within large clinical trials. These data provide support for the use of TMAs and image analysis in translational research.</docText>

        <docText>Attitude towards genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility: a comparison of affected and unaffected women.

The objective of this study is to evaluate women's awareness and interest in genetic testing for breast cancer risk, to identify socio-demographic factors, to analyse the reasons for wanting or not wanting to be tested and finally to determine whether breast cancer patients and healthy women have different attitudes towards genetic testing. Consecutive series of 879 women without and with breast cancer participated in a 20-item self-completing questionnaire. Among breast cancer patients, 57% answered that they would definitely or probably accept being tested, compared with 84% of women without breast cancer. At the multiple logistic regression analysis only to have a diagnosis of breast cancer conditioned significantly the interest to have genetic testing. Surprisingly, a family history of breast cancer was found to have no significant impact. The most frequently cited reason for being interested in genetic testing was 'to learn about your children's risk'. Although women's awareness about breast cancer genes is inadequate, the interest in genetic testing is substantial and higher both in healthy women and in women with breast cancer. These results provide important indications for the development of educational strategies.</docText>

KHANMOHAMMADI M., RAJABI F.H., GARMARUDI A.B., MOHAMMADZADEH R. &amp; MOHAMMADZADEH R. (2008) European Journal of Cancer Care Chemometrics assisted investigation of variations in infrared spectra of blood samples obtained from women with breast cancer: a new approach for cancer diagnosisFourier transform infrared spectra of blood samples obtained from healthy women and those affected by breast cancer have been analysed statistically. Several spectral differences were detected in the N-H stretching signals of amides I and II bands. The position of alpha-helix and beta-sheet amide I bands would shift in cancerous blood samples during stage development. Investigating the absorbance bands in the Fourier transform infrared spectra during the different stages of cancer, many changes are clearly observed in the intensity of a single band or the absorbance ratio of signals, indicating the changes that would occur in blood ingredients during cancer stages. These observations imply that the information is useful for diagnostic study of breast cancer and malignant abnormalities by infrared spectroscopy of whole blood samples. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was applied for classification of cancer case and normal case blood samples. The accuracy of the proposed method was 97.9%.</docText>

        <docText>BRCA1 5272-1G&gt;A and BRCA2 5374delTATG are founder mutations of high relevance for genetic counselling in breast/ovarian cancer families of Spanish origin.

Infante M, Durán M, Acedo A, Pérez-Cabornero L, Sanz DJ, García-González M, Beristain E, Esteban-Cardeñosa E, de la Hoya M, Teulé A, Vega A, Tejada M-I, Lastra E, Miner C, Velasco EA. BRCA1 5272-1G&gt;A and BRCA2 5374delTATG are founder mutations of high relevance for genetic counselling in breast/ovarian cancer families of Spanish origin. The distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ line mutations in breast/ovarian cancer families varies among different populations, which typically present a wide spectrum of unique mutations. Splicing mutation 5272-1G&gt;A of BRCA1 and frameshift mutation 5374delTATG of BRCA2 are highly prevalent mutations in Castilla-León (Spain), accounting for 18.4% and 13.6% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 positive families, respectively. To test the presence of founder effects, 9 Spanish 5272-1G&gt;A and 13 5374delTATG families were genotyped with polymorphic markers linked to BRCA1 or BRCA2. All the 5272-1G&gt;A families shared a common haplotype in eight markers (1.1 Mb region) and the mutation age was estimated in 15 generations ( approximately 380 years). A conserved haplotype associated to 5374delTATG was observed in four markers (0.82 Mb). The mutation occurred approximately 48 generations ago ( approximately 1200 years). Each mutation likely arose from a common ancestor that could be traced to a small area of Castilla-León and expanded to other Spanish regions. They can have a significant impact on the clinical management of asymptomatic carriers as well as on the genetic screening strategy to be followed in populations with Spanish ancestries.</docText>

        <docText>Boron-Containing Compounds as Preventive and Chemotherapeutic Agents for Cancer.

In the last few years boron (B) compounds became increasingly frequent in the chemotherapy of some forms of cancer with high malignancy and of inoperable cancers. As more B-based therapy chemicals are developed it is necessary to review the correlation between B and the incidence of different forms of cancer, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms influenced by B and to explore the relevance of B in the chemoprevention of cancer. This minireview analyzes dietary and therapeuptic principles based on the chemistry of B compounds and B-based radiotheraphy. We summarize studies correlating B-rich diets or B-rich environments with regional risks of specific forms of cancers, and studies about the utilization of natural and synthetic B-containing compounds as anticancer agents. We review mechanisms where B-containing compounds interfere with the physiology and reproduction of cancer cells. Types of cancers most frequently impacted by B-containing compounds include prostate, breast, cervical and lung cancer. Mechanisms involving B activity on cancer cells are based on the inhibition of a variety of enzymatic activities, including serine proteases, NAD-dehydrogenases, mRNA splicing and cell division, but also receptor binding mimicry, and the induction of apoptosis. Boron-enriched diets resulted in significant decrease in the risk for prostate and cervical cancer, and decrease in lung cancer in smoking women. Boron-based compounds show promising effects for the chemotheraphy of specific forms of cancer, but due to specific benefits should also be included in cancer chemopreventive strategies.</docText>

        <docText>Ultrasonography-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of microcalcifications: Comparison of the diagnostic yield of calcified cores and non-calcified cores on specimen radiographs.

Background: Microcalcifications found on mammography of asymptomatic women can be sampled by ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous breast biopsy when stereotactic core biopsy is unavailable or unsuccessful. The role of specimen radiograph needs to be reevaluated after US-guided biopsy. Purpose: To compare retrospectively the histological diagnoses of calcified cores and non-calcified cores as depicted on specimen radiographs after a US-guided, 11-gauge, vacuum-assisted biopsy using surgical histology as the reference standard. Material and Methods: A total of 135 consecutive patients underwent a US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy for calcifications with malignant histological results from 135 lesions. For each lesion, calcification was identified in at least one core on specimen radiographs. Calcified cores and non-calcified cores depicted on specimen radiographs were separately submitted to the pathology department. The pathological diagnoses of calcified cores and non-calcified cores were compared with final diagnoses at surgical excision. Results: Of a total of 2049 core specimens that were obtained (mean, 15 per lesion; range, 4-35 per lesion), 794 cores (mean, 5.9 per lesion; range, 1-17 per lesion) contained calcifications and 1255 cores (mean, 9.3 cores per lesion; range, 1-34 cores per lesion) did not contain calcifications. Calcified cores were more likely to enable an accurate diagnosis of cancer as compared to non-calcified cores (67%, 91 of 135 versus 52%, 70 of 135; P= 0.009). A diagnosis of cancer was more likely to be missed with non-calcified cores as compared to calcified cores (16%, 21 of 135 versus 4%, 5 of 135; P= 0.002). There was no difference in the underestimation of malignancy between calcified cores (29%, 39 of 135) and non-calcified cores (33%, 44 of 135) (P= 0.510). Conclusion: calcified cores depicted on specimen radiographs are more accurate for a diagnosis of cancer as compared to non-calcified cores obtained during US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of microcalcifications.</docText>

        <docText>Quantitative Organelle Proteomics of MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells reveals Multiple Subcellular Locations for Proteins in Cellular Functional Processes.

We have combined sucrose density gradient subcellular fractionation with quantitative, tandem-mass-spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to investigate spatial distributions of proteins in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Emphasis was placed on four major organellar compartments: cytosol, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion. 2184 proteins were securely identified. 481 proteins (22.0 % of total proteins identified) were found in unique sucrose gradient fractions, suggesting they may have unique subcellular locations. 454 proteins (20.8%) were found to be ubiquitously distributed. The remaining 1249 proteins (57.2%) were consistent with intermediate distribution over multiple, but not all, subcellular locations. 94 proteins implicated in breast cancer and 478 other proteins which share the same five major cellular biological processes with a majority of the breast cancer proteins were observed in 334 and 1223 subcellular locations respectively. The data obtained is used to evaluate the possibility of defining more exact sets of subcellular organelles, the completeness of current descriptions of spatial distribution of cellular proteins, the importance of multiple subcellular locations for proteins in functional processes, the subcellular distribution of proteins related to breast cancer and the possibility of using these methods for dynamic spatio/temporal studies of function/regulation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.</docText>

        <docText>Rapid and Label-Free Detection of Breast Cancer Biomarker CA15-3 in Clinical Human Serum Samples with Optofluidic Ring Resonator Sensors.

Sensitive and specific detection of breast cancer biomarker CA15-3 in human serum is an important step toward successful evaluation of clinical treatment and prediction of breast cancer recurrence. In this work, we developed an optofluidic ring resonator (OFRR) sensor and the corresponding sensing protocols for label-free CA15-3 detection without any additional signal amplification steps. Nonspecific serum protein adsorption was minimized with effective surface blocking methods. The sensor performance for CA15-3 detection was first characterized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and in fetal calf serum. Then the potential use of the OFRR as a simple clinical laboratory testing device for breast cancer diagnostics was tested by measuring the CA15-3 level in clinical human serum samples, and the results were compared with those of standard clinical lab tests. It was found that the OFRR was capable of detecting approximately 1 unit/mL CA15-3 in both PBS buffer and diluted serum within approximately 30 min. Our work marks the first demonstration of the optical ring resonator biosensor in real clinical applications that features low cost, simple detection procedures, rapid response time, low sample consumption, and high specificity.</docText>

        <docText>TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and breast cancer in northern Iran.

The p53 gene is one of the most extensively studied human genes because of its role as a tumor suppressor gene. Its diverse functions include DNA binding, cell cycle control, DNA repair, differentiation, genomic plasticity, and apoptosis. A common polymorphism of the p53 gene at codon 72 has been associated with human cancer susceptibility and prognosis. In this study, we investigated p53 codon 72 polymorphism in 42 breast cancer cases and 60 healthy individual in northern Iran. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh tumor tissues of patients and blood samples of healthy individuals. AS-PCR method was applied for determination of codon 72 polymorphism. The distribution of genotypes in breast cancer cases and controls were different (p = 0.001). Pro allele was significantly associated with the presence of breast cancer (odds ratio = 1.5 and 95% confidence interval = 0.85-2.63). Pro/Pro genotype was overrepresented in breast cancer. Based on these data, it is suggested that Pro allele may modify the risk of breast cancer in northern Iranian women.</docText>

        <docText>Dexamethasone downregulates BCRP mRNA and protein expression in breast cancer cell lines.

It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory drugs regulate breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) expression. Hence, we examined the effects of indomethacin and dexamethasone on BCRP expression in MCF cells. For evaluation of BCRP mRNA expression, relative quantitative PCR and comparative C1 method was exploited. BCRP protein expression was measured flow cytometrically with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) BXP-21. Dexamethasone showed a dose-independent and a time-dependent effect on decreasing the mRNA level of BCRP gene in comparison with control in MCF-7 and MCF-7/MX breast cancer cell lines, whereas no changes were noted in the presence of indomethacin. The level of BCRP protein, expressed as a ratio of the corresponding control, was decreased in dexamethasone-treated MCF-7/MX cells. These results could be of great importance when combination therapy protocols with cytotoxic agents and dexamethasone regimens are considered in breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Inhibition of tumor proteasome activity by gold-dithiocarbamato complexes via both redox-dependent and -independent processes.

We have previously reported on a gold(III) complex, namely [AuBr(2)(DMDT)] (N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamate) showing potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory activities toward human cancer cells and identifying the cellular proteasome as one of the major targets. However, the importance of the oxidation state of the gold center and the involved mechanism of action has yet to be established. Here we show that both gold(III)- and gold(I)-dithiocarbamato species, namely [AuBr(2)(ESDT)] (AUL12) and [Au(ESDT)](2) (AUL15), could inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome and 26S proteasome in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome target proteins, and induction of cell death, but at significantly different levels. Gold(I)- and gold(III)-compound-mediated proteasome inhibition and cell death induction were completely reversed by the addition of a reducing agent, dithiothreitol or N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting the involvement of redox processes. Furthermore, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with gold(III) compound (AUL12), but not the gold(I) analog (AUL15), resulted in the production of significant levels of reactive oxygen species. Our study provides strong evidence that the cellular proteasome is an important target of both gold(I) and gold(III)-dithiocarbamates, but distinct cellular mechanisms of action are responsible for their different overall effect.

        <docText>Prognostic impact of ALDH1 in breast cancer: a story of stem cells and tumor microenvironment.

The concept of cancer cells being hierarchically organized and arising from their own progenitor stem cells will have important implications on cancer therapy. If this hypothesis were to be true then the paucity of estrogen receptors in stem cells as well as their inherent drug resistance mechanisms pose a challenge to current targeted therapies. In this study, we sought to examine the prognostic relevance of ALDH1, a putative cancer stem cell marker, by immunohistochemistry. The four cohorts analyzed included an adjuvantly treated series of 245 invasive cancers, a neoadjuvantly treated series of 34 cases, and two series of 58 and 40 triple negative cases, respectively. Both tumor cell and stromal expression for ALDH1 was evaluated, where possible. Tumor cell ALDH1 expression significantly correlated only with basal-like and HER2 tumor types in the adjuvant series and tumor grade in the neoadjuvant cohort. No significant enrichment for ALDH1 positive cells was observed in the postneoadjuvant therapy specimens compared to pretreatment samples. On the other hand, high degree of stromal expression was significantly associated with best disease-free survival as well as a trend for overall survival. The association of stromal expression was confirmed in an independent cohort of triple negative cases. The novel finding is that tumor microenvironment may play a significant role in determining the prognostic impact of stem/progenitor cells in human breast tumors.</docText>

        <docTitle>Role of GPR30 in the mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Role of GPR30 in the mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

Tamoxifen is the most frequently used anti-hormonal drug for treatment of women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of tamoxifen resistance and the impact of the new estrogen G-protein coupled receptor (GPR30). MCF-7 cells were continuously exposed to tamoxifen for 6 months to induce resistance to the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen. These tamoxifen-resistant cells (TAM-R) exhibited enhanced sensitivity to 17-ss-estradiol and GPR30 agonist, G1, when compared to the parental cells. In TAM-R cells, tamoxifen was able to stimulate the cell growth and MAPK phosphorylation. These effects were abolished by EGFR inhibitor AG1478, GPR30 anti-sense oligonucleotide, and the selective c-Src inhibitor PP2. Only EGFR basal expression was slightly elevated in the TAM-R cells, whereas GPR30 expression and the basal phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK remained unchanged when compared to the parental cells. Interestingly, estrogen treatment significantly increased GPR30 translocation to the cell surface, which was stronger in TAM-R cells. Continuous treatment of MCF-7 cells with GPR30 agonist G1 mimics the long-term treatment with tamoxifen and increases drastically its agonistic activity. This data suggests the important role of GPR30/EGFR receptor signaling in the development of tamoxifen resistance. The inhibition of this pathway is a valid option to improve anti-hormone response in breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Retinal function in patients treated with tamoxifen.

Tamoxifen, an effective treatment of breast cancer, has been shown to cause ocular toxic effects. The purpose of this study was to determine retinal toxicity by full-field and focal electroretinograms (ERGs) in patients treated with tamoxifen. Full-field and focal ERGs were obtained from three groups: Tamoxifen-14 females (47-72 years, mean 58.3 +/- 9.1) with normal fundus, treated with tamoxifen from 2 to 37 months; No Treatment-10 females (39-65 years, mean 50.1 +/- 8.7) with previous breast cancer diagnosis and before tamoxifen treatment; Control-13 normal female volunteers (41-81 years, mean 52.7 +/- 12.1). Peak-to-peak amplitude and b-wave implicit time were measured and statistically analyzed. Mean peak-to-peak amplitudes and implicit time from full-field and focal ERGs were comparable for the three different groups. Low-dosage tamoxifen showed no retinotoxic effect assessed by full-field and focal ERG in this small group of women with breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>The Florida Initiative for Quality Cancer Care: a regional project to measure and improve cancer care.

BACKGROUND: The Florida Initiative for Quality Cancer Care (FIQCC) is a physician and practice-based quality improvement project that was conceived to study the barriers to delivering quality cancer care in Florida. The ultimate goal of the FIQCC is to improve cancer care throughout the state. This report provides an overview of the development and implementation of the FIQCC. METHODS: Representatives from 11 oncology practices across the state of Florida selected quality measures consistent with evidence-, consensus-, and safety-based guidelines that could be abstracted from medical records. Trained abstractors review records of all eligible patients seen by each practice and enter the data into a Web-based application. Frequencies of responses for each indicator are tabulated for overall and practice-specific level of adherence and compared among practices. Seminars are held to discuss strategies to address opportunities for improvement in the quality of cancer care identified by the survey. RESULTS: Three quality of cancer indicator modules organized by diagnosis (colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer) as well as a module relating to a domain of care (psychosocial care) have been developed by FIQCC participants. All of the participating practices successfully completed data collection for the colorectal cancer and breast cancer modules as well as the psychosocial care module. To date, 1,622 charts have been successfully entered into the FIQCC database. Results from the colorectal survey confirmed high overall rates of compliance with a series of quality indicators but also identified areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The FIQCC is working toward becoming a statewide program that enables practicing oncologists and investigators to measure and address disparities in the delivery of quality cancer care.</docText>

        <docText>Decisions and ethical issues among BRCA carriers and the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

The lifetime risks for both breast and ovarian cancer for BRCA mutation carriers far exceeds the general population risk of 13% for breast cancer and 1.4% for ovarian cancer. BRCA carriers have unique and medically complicated decisions to make regarding their cancer treatment or risk reduction. As BRCA testing becomes increasingly common among unaffected individuals in families with a previously documented BRCA mutation, there are a growing number of individuals with unique psychosocial needs and concerns. This review paper describes the BRCA 1/2 population, discusses preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and describes the decisions and ethical issues related to PGD among the BRCA 1/ 2 population.</docText>

        <docTitle>Delayed-Immediate Breast Reconstruction: Technical and Timing Considerations.</docTitle>
        <docText>Delayed-Immediate Breast Reconstruction: Technical and Timing Considerations.

BACKGROUND:: In 2002, we implemented a new 2-stage approach, "delayed-immediate breast reconstruction," for patients who desire breast reconstruction and who are at an increased risk for conditions necessitating postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). There is increasing acceptance of this approach in clinical practice. The purpose of this report is to highlight important technical and timing considerations in delayed-immediate reconstruction that help ensure the best outcomes with low rates of expander loss. TECHNIQUE AND TIMING:: Stage 1 of delayed-immediate reconstruction consists of skin-sparing mastectomy with insertion of a saline-filled tissue expander to serve as an adjustable scaffold to preserve the 3-dimensional shape of the breast skin envelope. Patients who do not require PMRT undergo stage 2 of delayed-immediate reconstruction (definitive breast reconstruction) within 2 weeks after stage 1 to avoid delays in the start of adjuvant chemotherapy and to preserve the ptotic shape of the preserved breast skin envelope. In patients who do require PMRT, the tissue expander is deflated before PMRT to create a flat chest wall surface to permit modern 3-beam radiation delivery. Beginning 2 weeks after completion of PMRT, the tissue expander is reinflated to the predeflation volume. Three months after PMRT, a "skin-preserving" delayed reconstruction is performed with removal of the expander and transfer of an autologous tissue flap. CONCLUSIONS:: Delayed-immediate reconstruction allows patients who do not require PMRT to receive the benefits of skin sparing mastectomy with aesthetic outcomes similar to those of immediate reconstruction, and patients who do require PMRT, receive a skin preserving delayed reconstruction, while avoiding the problems that can be associated with radiation delivery after an immediate breast reconstruction.</docText>

        <docTitle>Determinants of Percentage and Area Measures of Mammographic Density.</docTitle>
        <docText>Determinants of Percentage and Area Measures of Mammographic Density.

Mammographic density is one of the strongest predictors of breast cancer risk. Typically expressed as a percentage of the breast area occupied by radiologically dense tissue on a mammogram, its full value may not be realized because of its negative association with body mass index. A simpler measure of mammographic density, independent of other breast cancer risk factors and equally predictive of risk, would be preferable for risk prediction models. Percentage and area measures of mammographic density were determined for 815 women at high risk for breast cancer from the baseline assessments in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study I, a trial of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention conducted between 1992 and 2001. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess associations between risk factors and the mammographic measures. Percent dense area was negatively associated with age, body mass index, menopausal status, predicted risk, and smoking status (R(2) = 24%). Dense area was negatively associated with only age and body mass index (R(2) = 7%), and the latter association was much weaker than for percent dense area. Nondense area was positively associated with age, body mass index, and predicted risk (R(2) = 36%). Dense area was not associated with the multitude of risk factors that percent dense area was, making it a simpler biomarker for risk prediction modeling. Both dense area and percent dense area should be presented whenever possible for comparisons in research.</docText>

        <docText>Intraoperative evaluation of breast tumor margins with optical coherence tomography.

As breast cancer screening rates increase, smaller and more numerous lesions are being identified earlier, leading to more breast-conserving surgical procedures. Achieving a clean surgical margin represents a technical challenge with important clinical implications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is introduced as an intraoperative high-resolution imaging technique that assesses surgical breast tumor margins by providing real-time microscopic images up to 2 mm beneath the tissue surface. In a study of 37 patients split between training and study groups, OCT images covering 1 cm(2) regions were acquired from surgical margins of lumpectomy specimens, registered with ink, and correlated with corresponding histologic sections. A 17-patient training set used to establish standard imaging protocols and OCT evaluation criteria showed that areas of higher scattering tissue with a heterogeneous pattern were indicative of tumor cells and tumor tissue in contrast to lower scattering adipocytes found in normal breast tissue. The remaining 20 patients were enrolled into the feasibility study. Of these lumpectomy specimens, 11 were identified with a positive or close surgical margin and 9 were identified with a negative margin under OCT. Based on histologic findings, 9 true positives, 9 true negatives, 2 false positives, and 0 false negatives were found, yielding a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 82%. These results show the potential of OCT as a real-time method for intraoperative margin assessment in breast-conserving surgeries.</docText>

        <docTitle>Conservative surgery with and without radiotherapy in elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer: A prospective randomised multicentre trial.</docTitle>
        <docText>Conservative surgery with and without radiotherapy in elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer: A prospective randomised multicentre trial.

Breast conserving therapy (BCT) including postoperative irradiation of the remaining breast tissue is generally accepted as the best treatment for the majority of patients with early-stage breast cancer. The question is whether there is a necessity for irradiating all patients. Between 2001 and 2005, 749 women aged 55-75 years with infiltrating breast carcinoma were randomly assigned to breast conservative surgery, with or without radiotherapy (RT), to evaluate the incidence of in-breast recurrence (IBR). After 5 years of median follow-up, the cumulative incidence of IBR was 2.5% in the surgery-only arm and 0.7% in the surgery plus RT arm. There are no differences in terms of overall survival and distant disease-free survival. The preliminary evaluation suggests that breast irradiation after conservative surgery can be avoided without exposing these patients to an increased risk of distant-disease recurrence. Prolonged follow-up will further clarify the possible risks and late sequelae potentially induced by breast RT.</docText>

        <docText>Initial Efficacy Results of RTOG 0319: Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) Confined to the Region of the Lumpectomy Cavity for Stage I/ II Breast Carcinoma.

PURPOSE: This prospective study (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0319) examines the use of three-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Initial data on efficacy and toxicity are presented. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with Stage I or II breast cancer with lesions &lt;/=3 cm, negative margins and with &lt;/=3 positive nodes were eligible. The 3D-CRT was 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy/fraction delivered 2x/day. Ipsilateral breast, ipsilateral nodal, contralateral breast, and distant failure (IBF, INF, CBF, DF) were estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Mastectomy-free, disease-free, and overall survival (MFS, DFS, OS) were recorded. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3, was used to grade acute and late toxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were entered and 52 patients are eligible and evaluable for efficacy. The median age of patients was 61 years with the following characteristics: 46% tumor size &lt;1 cm; 87% invasive ductal histology; 94% American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage I; 65% postmenopausal; 83% no chemotherapy; and 71% with no hormone therapy. Median follow-up is 4.5 years (1.7-4.8). Four-year estimates (95% CI) of efficacy are: IBF 6% (0-12%) [4% within field (0-9%)]; INF 2% (0-6%); CBF 0%; DF 8% (0-15%); MFS 90% (78-96%); DFS 84% (71-92%); and OS 96% (85-99%). Only two (4%) Grade 3 toxicities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Initial efficacy and toxicity using 3D-CRT to deliver APBI appears comparable to other experiences with similar follow-up. However, additional patients, further follow-up, and mature Phase III data are needed to evaluate the extent of application, limitations, and value of this particular form of APBI.</docText>

        <docText>Long-term follow-up-findings in mammography and ultrasound after intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for breast cancer.

The purpose of this study was to assess mammographic and sonographic findings in a long-term follow-up (&gt;or=3 years) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and IORT, either applied as boost or exclusively. Follow-up-findings of 54 patients were retrospectively evaluated and compared to a control group of 48 patients, treated with BCS and whole-breast radiotherapy. After IORT patients had a higher incidence of fat necroses manifesting as oil cysts in the late follow-up mammograms (n = 31 vs n = 8); furthermore, oil cysts were larger in the IORT group (median 4.5 vs 1.4 cm(2)). In 25 IORT patients the oil cysts arose from partially organized hematomas/seromas, which in this group were generally more frequent (n = 38 vs n = 9) and larger (median 3.6 vs 1.8 cm(2)). After IORT a decreasing incidence of hematomas/seromas was reciprocal to an increasing incidence of oil cysts, and the size of both entities correlated with each other. Liquid lesions with polypoid inner wall thickening on ultrasound, attributed to organized hematomas/seromas or fat necroses, appear more frequently after IORT (n = 15 vs n = 1). In conclusion, IORT is associated with a high incidence of large oil cysts, which arise from likewise large partially organized wound cavities. On ultrasound pronounced partial organization with polypoid inner wall thickening is a frequent finding in those cavities.</docText>

        <docText>Expression of metastasis suppressor gene maspin is reduced in breast cancer brain metastases and correlates with the estrogen receptor status.

OBJECTIVES: The suppressor gene maspin (Serpin B5) is a promising candidate for future treatment. We have examined the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of maspin in normal breast tissue, breast cancer primaries, brain metastases and breast cancer cell lines. Results were compared to hormone receptor expression and proliferation index. METHODS: Maspin mRNA expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in fresh frozen human samples and breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47-D and MDA-MB-231. Maspin protein, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression as well as Ki-67 proliferation index were detected by immunohistochemistry from 16 patients with breast cancer primaries and breast cancer brain metastases. RESULTS: In relation to normal breast tissue, maspin mRNA expression was decreased in primary tumors and again decreased in brain metastases. Normalized C(T) values were 1 (normal tissue), 0.3 (primary tumors) and 0.13 (brain metastases). Immunohistochemistry revealed same tendencies. In comparison to poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines, maspin mRNA expression was decreased in highly invasive and metastatic 231-parental cell lines. In contrast, maspin mRNA expression was increased in 231-brain, and it was not detectable in 231-bone. Patients with maspin-positive primary tumors showed longer survival. DISCUSSION: This finding adds maspin to the list of metastasis suppressor genes possibly involved in the formation of breast cancer brain metastases.</docText>

        <docText>Serum estradiol should be monitored not only during the peri-menopausal period but also the post-menopausal period at the time of aromatase inhibitor administration.

BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is being extensively used as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer. On the other hand, it has been reported that ovarian function was restored when AI was administered to patients who had undergone chemical menopause with chemotherapy or tamoxifen. However, there have been no reports of comprehensive monitoring of estradiol (E2) in breast cancer patients with ordinary menopause who were being administered AI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Beginning in March 2008, regular monitoring of the serum levels of E2, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was performed for 66 postmenopausal breast cancer patients who had been started on AI therapy. For this study, we chose anastrozole as the AI. The assays of those hormones were outsourced to a commercial clinical laboratory. RESULTS: In 4 of the 66 patients the serum E2 level was decreased at 3 months but had then increased at 6 months, while in 2 other patients E2 was decreased at both 3 and 6 months but had increased at 9 months. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that, in some breast cancer patients with ordinary menopause, E2 rebounds following AI therapy. In the future, E2 monitoring should be performed for a larger number of patients being administered AI therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our trial registration number is 19-11-1211.</docText>

        <docText>From normal cell types to malignant phenotypes.

ABSTRACT: The phenotypic diversity of breast cancer has been proposed to result from different target cell types undergoing oncogenic transformation and giving rise to cancer stem cells. Global gene expression profiling revealed distinct molecular phenotypes and some of these signatures were held to reflect the cell of origin, with the basal carcinomas arising from basal/progenitor cells. Recent work challenges this view by providing evidence that luminal precursor cells are involved in the pathogenesis of basal breast cancers and has made new links between normal cell populations and molecular tumor phenotypes.</docText>

        <docText>Epithelial to mesenchymal transition and breast cancer.

ABSTRACT: Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast carcinoma encompasses the phenotypic spectrum whereby epithelial carcinoma cells within a primary tumor acquire mesenchymal features and re-epithelialize to form a cohesive secondary mass at a metastatic site. Such plasticity has implications in progression of breast carcinoma to metastasis, and will likely influence response to therapy. The transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of molecular and cellular processes that underlie breast cancer and result in characteristic changes in cell behavior can be monitored using an increasing array of marker proteins. Amongst these markers exists the potential for emergent prognostic, predictive and therapeutic targeting.</docText>

        <docText>Extended use of intravenous bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with cancer.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of skeletal complications in patients with multiple myeloma, and metastatic breast, prostate, or lung cancers, when therapy with intravenous bisphosphonates is continued for longer than 21 months. METHODS: The primary outcome was the diagnosis of at least one skeletal-related event (SRE) after 21 months of therapy. The secondary outcome was the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ). RESULTS: The primary outcome was 30%. The secondary outcome was 3%, while six patients (5%) were referred to a dentist for suspected ONJ. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a continued benefit when intravenous bisphosphonates are given for longer than 21 months.</docText>

        <docText>Correlation of expression of human arrest-defective-1 (hARD1) protein with breast cancer.

Human arrest-defective-1 (hARD1) was reported to be important in regulating cell cycle and promoting lung cancer cell proliferation. Here we have investigated the correlation between hARD1 and breast cancer. Analysis with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry (FCM) demonstrated that overexpression of hARD1 was associated with increased proliferation of MCF-7 cell, a human breast cancer cell line. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining assay showed that hARD1 presented higher in breast cancer tissue than the adjacent tissue; accumulation of hARD1 protein was higher in 86% (37/43) of breast cancer, far more than noncancer samples. Our results suggest that hARD1 might play an important role in breast cancer carcinogenesis.</docText>

        <docText>Reduced expression of tocopherol-associated protein (TAP/Sec14L2) in human breast cancer.

We show that TAP/Sec14L2 had a high expression in normal/benign breast, prostate, and liver tissues as compared to lung, colon, and kidney. Its expression was downregulated in breast cancer cell lines shown by quantitative-PCR. Further, 57% of 141 human invasive breast carcinomas had no or markedly reduced TAP/Sec14L2 expression by immunohistochemical staining, and the rate increased to 80% in high grade invasive carcinomas (p &lt; .01). This downregulation of TAP/Sec14L2 was also present in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) associated with invasive carcinomas. These findings raise the possibility that TAP/Sec14L2 may serve as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinogenesis.</docText>

        <docTitle>TNF receptor p55 and IL-8(72) and IL-8(77) isoforms: blood and urine levels in breast cancer patients.</docTitle>
        <docText>TNF receptor p55 and IL-8(72) and IL-8(77) isoforms: blood and urine levels in breast cancer patients.

In the preliminary study reported here, 37 patients with breast cancer and 10 healthy volunteers were analyzed for soluble TNF-R p55 and two variants of IL-8 consisting of 72 and 77 amino acid residues (IL-8(72) and IL-8(77), respectively) in their blood and urine with novel ELISA test systems. The clinical/prognostic values of determining these inflammatory cytokines at different stages of the cancer process appeared to depend on the treatment course being evaluated. In contrast to expectations, it was noted that there was a stabile tendency for decreased TNF-R p55 and IL-8(72) levels in the plasma and urine of breast cancer patients as compared with levels observed with healthy controls. Moreover, patients that underwent polychemotherapy treatments were notable for significant decreases in IL-8(72) and TNF-R p55 levels in their blood plasma; these findings contrasted with significant increases in these parameters in these patients' urine. Interestingly, the IL-8(77) isoform that now appeared both in the urine and plasma of patients was not detectable before initiation of the polychemotherapy. In spite of all these findings, individual fluctuations among these parameters still do not allow us to establish, at this time, any strong correlations between these values with any particular breast cancer stage or a type of treatment. Nonetheless, while the results here are preliminary, they demonstrate that testing for TNF-R, along with IL-8 isoforms, in the blood plasma and urine could potentially present a valid means for monitoring of the overall immune and disease progress/remission status in breast cancer patients. Ongoing studies with larger patient sample sizes, as well as collecting and analyzing samples at multiple time points--to minimize the potential influence of any inherent variability in cytokine levels in humans--will hopefully allow us to specify what these preliminary results reported here suggest, i.e., the potential utility of this experimental approach for determining disease progression or efficacy of treatment in cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Benefits and risks of raloxifene by vertebral fracture status.

Abstract Objective: Women without versus those with vertebral fracture may have different benefits and risks during raloxifene treatment. Our objective was to compare the effects of raloxifene to decrease risk for vertebral fracture and invasive breast cancer with its effect to increase risk for venous thromboembolism in postmenopausal women without or with baseline vertebral fracture. Research design and methods: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation trial included postmenopausal women with osteoporosis randomized to placebo, raloxifene 60 mg/day, or raloxifene 120 mg/day for 4 years. The protocol specified subgroups based on whether or not patients had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Absolute differences between placebo and raloxifene 60 mg/day (the approved dose) for endpoints in these groups were defined as the incidence in the raloxifene group minus the incidence in the placebo group. Results: Raloxifene decreased the incidence of vertebral fracture and invasive breast cancer while increasing the incidence of venous thromboembolism. All treatment by vertebral fracture status interaction p-values were greater than 0.13, indicating that the effect of raloxifene on these outcomes was not significantly different between patients without versus those with vertebral fractures. In women without baseline vertebral fracture, absolute risk differences between the raloxifene and placebo group included vertebral fracture -2.83%, invasive breast cancer -1.21%, and venous thromboembolism +0.28%. In women with baseline vertebral fracture, absolute risk differences between raloxifene and placebo group included vertebral fracture -8.21%, invasive breast cancer -0.75% and venous thromboembolism +0.91%. The analysis had limited power to test whether raloxifene had a significantly different effect on venous thromboembolism in women without versus those with a vertebral fracture. Conclusions: In women without and in those with vertebral fractures at baseline, the effects of raloxifene to decrease vertebral fracture and invasive breast cancer were greater than its effects to increase venous thromboembolism.</docText>

        <docTitle>Paclitaxel-containing nano-engineered polymeric capsules towards cancer therapy.</docTitle>
        <docText>Paclitaxel-containing nano-engineered polymeric capsules towards cancer therapy.

Paclitaxel is one of the anticancer agents most often used in clinical oncology practice for the treatment of ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancers. Nanoengineered polymeric capsules (NPCs) represent a new and very effective tool for the encapsulation and smart release of different compounds. In present work capsules were fabricated by means of the layer-by-layer assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes onto colloidal particles, followed by removal of the cores at low pH to obtain hollow microcapsules. Paclitaxel was loaded into the capsule. As tumors exhibit a lower extracellular pH than normal tissues, the property of NPCs to open the pores in their shell at slightly acidic pH values could be used for the triggered release of paclitaxel within a tumor microenvironment. For the characterization of NPCs, quartz crystal microbalance was used to monitor the process of shell growth on planar supports. The effective encapsulation of paclitaxel was then demonstrated by atomic force microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy, whereas its release was characterized by Uv-vis spectroscopy. Finally the biological activity of encapsulated paclitaxel against human breast cancer cells was assessed.</docText>

        <docTitle>Gemcitabine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Gemcitabine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group (ERG) report into the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gemcitabine with paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in patients who have already received chemotherapy treatment with an anthracycline, compared with current standard of care, based upon the manufacturer's submission to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process. The clinical evidence for gemcitabine as a treatment for MBC comes from the unpublished JHQG trial (some data commercial-in-confidence): overall survival was 3 months longer for the gemcitabine/paclitaxel arm (18.5 months) than for the paclitaxel arm (15.8 months) (p = 0.0489); gemcitabine/paclitaxel also improved tumour response and time to documented progression of disease compared with paclitaxel monotherapy, but haematological serious adverse events were more common. In the absence of any formal methods of indirect comparison there is insufficient robust evidence to compare the relative effectiveness of gemcitabine/paclitaxel with docetaxel monotherapy or docetaxel/capecitabine combination therapy. The manufacturers used a Markov state transition model to estimate the effect of treatment with five different chemotherapy regimes, adopting a 3-year time horizon with docetaxel monotherapy as the comparator. Health state utilities for different stages of disease progression and for patients experiencing treatment-related toxicity are used to derive quality-adjusted life expectancy with each treatment. The base-case cost-effectiveness estimate for gemcitabine/paclitaxel versus docetaxel is 17,168 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). When longer survival with docetaxel is assumed in a sensitivity analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is 30,000 pounds per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimates a 70% probability of gemcitabine/paclitaxel being cost-effective relative to docetaxel at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 35,000 pounds. There is considerable uncertainty over the results because of the lack of formal quality assessment or assessment of the comparability of the 15 trials included in the input data, and the questionable validity of the indirect comparison method adopted. An illustrative analysis using a different method for indirect comparison carried out by the ERG produces an ICER of 45,811 pounds per QALY for gemcitabine/paclitaxel versus docetaxel. The guidance issued by NICE in November 2006 as a result of the STA states that gemcitabine in combination with paclitaxel, within its licensed indication, is recommended as an option for the treatment of MBC only when docetaxel monotherapy or docetaxel plus capecitabine is also considered appropriate.</docText>

        <docText>Potential role of chitinase 3-like-1 in inflammation-associated carcinogenic changes of epithelial cells.

The family of mammalian chitinases includes members both with and without glycohydrolase enzymatic activity against chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine. Chitin is the structural component of fungi, crustaceans, insects and parasitic nematodes, but is completely absent in mammals. Exposure to antigens containing chitin- or chitin-like structures sometimes induces strong T helper type-I responses in mammals, which may be associated with the induction of mammalian chitinases. Chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1), a member of the mammalian chitinase family, is induced specifically during the course of inflammation in such disorders as inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis and asthma. In addition, CHI3L1 is expressed and secreted by several types of solid tumors including glioblastoma, colon cancer, breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Although the exact function of CHI3L1 in inflammation and cancer is still largely unknown, CHI3L1 plays a pivotal role in exacerbating the inflammatory processes and in promoting angiogenesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. CHI3L1 may be highly involved in the chronic engagement of inflammation which potentiates development of epithelial tumorigenesis presumably by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the protein kinase B signaling pathways. Anti-CHI3L1 antibodies or pan-chitinase inhibitors may have the potential to suppress CHI3L1-mediated chronic inflammation and the subsequent carcinogenic change in epithelial cells.</docText>

        <docText>Anticancer activity of a new Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue.

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) has a pivotal role in the biology of reproduction processes. In extrapituitary compartments GnRH and its receptor act as a part of the autocrin regulatory system of cell proliferation, resulting in its anticancer activity. Here the anticancer activity of a new analogue of GnRH has been investigated. Results indicate that proliferation of human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines is dose-dependently inhibited. The inhibitory efficiency of this new analogue is proved to be higher than the original triptorelin. In addition to its antimitogenic activity, evidence was found for the involvement of the apoptotic mechanism in the action of the new analogue. Furthermore the presence of chemical groups in the peptide sequence is thought to increase the protease stability of the new analogue in comparison with triptorelin. Consequently our new analogue can be considered as a good pharmaceutical candidate. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers (Pept Sci), 2009.</docText>

        <docText>Apoptosis-inducing effects of Morinda citrifolia L. and doxorubicin on the Ehrlich ascites tumor in Balb-c mice.

Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) is a herbal remedy with promising anti-cancer properties. However, its effects on various cancers are to be investigated to make a firm conclusion before implementing it into the clinical practice. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic potential of noni on Ehrlich ascites tumor grown in female Balb-c mice and also combined it with a potent anti-cancer agent, doxorubicin. One group received noni only (n = 8), another one doxorubicin (n = 8), and the other one noni + doxorubicin (n = 8) for 14 days after the inoculation of cells. The control group (n = 7) received 0.9% NaCl only. We found that short and long diameters of the tumor tissues were about 40-50% smaller, compared to those in control group. This anti-growth effect resulted from the induction of apoptosis, which was confirmed by the positive results from the Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) analysis and the active caspase-3 cells in tissues. Apoptosis also confirmed by caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 elevation in serum of the treated groups. Further, the proliferation was decreased, which was immunohistochemically shown by the PCNA staining. We conclude that noni may be useful in the treatment of breast cancer either on its own or in combination with doxorubicin. Further studies are warranted to assess the dosage and safety of using noni fruit juice in conjuction with anti-cancer drugs against breast cancer.

        <docText>Women's decisions regarding tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention: responses to a tailored decision aid.

Tamoxifen reduces primary breast cancer incidence, yet causes serious side effects. To date, few women with increased breast cancer risk have elected to use tamoxifen for chemoprevention. The objective of the study was to determine women's knowledge of and attitudes toward tamoxifen following exposure to a tailored decision aid (DA). A total of 632 women with a 5-year risk of breast cancer &gt;/=1.66% (Mean = 2.56, range = 1.7-17.3) were recruited from two healthcare organizations. Participants viewed an online DA that informed them about their 5-year risk of breast cancer and presented individually tailored content depicting the risks/benefits of tamoxifen prophylaxis. Outcome measures included behavioral intentions (to seek additional information about tamoxifen, to talk to a physician about tamoxifen, and to take tamoxifen); knowledge; and perceived risks and benefits of tamoxifen. After viewing the DA, 29% of participants said they intended to seek more information or talk to their doctor about tamoxifen, and only 6% believed they would take tamoxifen. Knowledge was considerable, with 63% of women answering at least 5 of 6 knowledge questions correctly. Participants were concerned about the risks of tamoxifen, and many believed that the benefits of tamoxifen did not outweigh the risks. This study is the largest to date to test women's preferences for taking tamoxifen and one of the largest to have tested the impact of a tailored DA. After viewing the DA, women demonstrated good understanding of tamoxifen's risks and benefits, but most were not interested in taking tamoxifen for breast cancer chemoprevention.</docText>

        <docText>Embryonic mammary anlagen analysis using immunolabelling of whole mounts.

The mouse mammary gland is a unique organ since although the mammary gland primordium forms during embryogenesis, the majority of development occurs postnatally upon hormonal stimulation at puberty and full functionality (i.e. lactation) is not achieved until after parturition. Since both the epidermis and mammary glands share the same developmental origin, many mouse models with epidermal phenotypes often also exhibit abnormal mammary gland development. However, since the most widely used methods to analyse mammary glands are laborious and time-consuming, many mouse models exist that have not been analysed for mammary phenotypes. We have developed a simplified method that allows rapid analysis of embryonic mammary anlagen using immunolabelling of whole mounts that should facilitate more comprehensive studies of mouse mammary glands.</docText>

        <docTitle>Breast cancer in young women: poor survival despite intensive treatment.</docTitle>
        <docText>Breast cancer in young women: poor survival despite intensive treatment.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is uncommon in young women and correlates with a less favourable prognosis; still it is the most frequent cancer in women under 40, accounting for 30-40% of all incident female cancer. The aim of this study was to study prognosis in young women, quantifying how much stage at diagnosis and management on the one hand, and tumour biology on the other; each contribute to the worse prognosis seen in this age group. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a registry based cohort of women aged 20-69 (n = 22 017) with a primary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (1992-2005), women aged 20-34 (n = 471), 35-39 (n = 858) and 40-49 (n = 4789) were compared with women aged 50-69 years (n = 15 899). The cumulative 5-year relative survival ratio and the relative excess mortality (RER) were calculated. The cumulative 5-year relative survival ratio was lowest in women aged 20-34. The RER was 2.84 for women aged 20-34 and decreased with increasing age (RER 1.76 and 1.17 for women aged 35-39 and 40-49, respectively). The excess risk was, however, present only in disease stages I and II. For women aged 20-34 with stage I disease RER was 4.63, and 6.70 in the subgroup with tumour size 1-10 mm. The absolute difference in stage I between the youngest and the reference groups amounted to nearly 8%, with a 90% 5-year survival in women aged 20-34. In stages IIa and IIb, the relative excess risk was not as dramatic, but the absolute differences approached 15%. The youngest women with small tumours generally received more aggressive treatment than women in older age groups. CONCLUSIONS: After correction for stage, tumour characteristics and treatment, age remained an independent risk factor for breast cancer death in women &lt;35 years of age. The excess risk for young women was only seen in early stages of disease and was most pronounced in women with small tumours. Young women affected by breast cancer have a high risk of dying compared to their middle-aged counterparts even if diagnosed early and receiving an intense treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Short form 1b human prolactin receptor down-regulates expression of the long form.

Alternative splicing produces different human prolactin (PRL) receptors. These include a long form (LF) and two short forms (SF1a and SF1b). The SFs of the receptor can act as dominant negatives for PRL effector function through the LF. This is proposed to be due to LF-SF hetero-dimerization and resultant interference with LF-LF dimer signaling. We and others have provided evidence for LF-SF hetero-dimerization of the human receptors in support of this mechanism. However, to further investigate the ways SF may influence LF function, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with vectors coding for tagged (green fluorescent protein or luciferase) LF alone, or this plus untagged SF1b and measured LF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) intensity, LF-luciferase activity, and LF mRNA 48h later. Equal amounts of SF1b cDNA decreased LF-GFP fluorescence intensity, LF-luciferase activity and LF mRNA by 80-100%. Similar co-transfections with untagged LF had no significant effect on tagged LF expression. Use of hygromycin showed degradation of already formed protein was the same for LF-luciferase alone and LF-luciferase with SF1b. Inhibition of mRNA synthesis, on the other hand, showed that SF1b expression accelerated LF mRNA degradation 2-3 fold. SF1b also down-regulated expression of endogenous LF mRNA in T47D breast cancer cells and opposed an increase in cell number resulting from transfection with extra LF alone. These results demonstrate a heretofore unrecognized mechanism whereby SF1b affects the end result of signaling through the LF receptor. The effects on cell number also support the concept that the LF:SF1b ratio may be relevant to tumor growth.</docText>

        <docTitle>Tissue-Selective Regulation of Aromatase Expression by Calcitriol: Implications for Breast Cancer Therapy.</docTitle>
        <docText>Tissue-Selective Regulation of Aromatase Expression by Calcitriol: Implications for Breast Cancer Therapy.

Aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes estrogen synthesis, is critical for the progression of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (BCa) in postmenopausal women. We show that calcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D, regulates the expression of aromatase in a tissue-selective manner. Calcitriol significantly decreased aromatase expression in human BCa cells and adipocytes and caused substantial increases in human osteosarcoma cells (a bone cell model exhibiting osteoblast phenotype in culture) and modest increases in ovarian cancer cells. Calcitriol administration to immunocompromised mice bearing human BCa xenografts decreased aromatase mRNA levels in the tumors and the surrounding mammary adipose tissue but did not alter ovarian aromatase expression. In BCa cells, calcitriol also reduced the levels of prostaglandins (PGs), major stimulators of aromatase transcription, by suppressing the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (which catalyzes PG synthesis) and increasing that of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (which catalyzes PG degradation). The mechanism of aromatase down-regulation by calcitriol in BCa cells is therefore 2-fold: a direct repression of aromatase transcription via promoter II through the vitamin D-response elements identified in this promoter and an indirect suppression by reducing the levels of PGs. Combinations of calcitriol with three different aromatase inhibitors (AIs) caused enhanced inhibition of BCa cell growth. The combination of calcitriol and an AI may have potential benefits for BCa therapy. In addition to augmenting the ability of AIs to inhibit BCa growth, calcitriol acting as a selective aromatase modulator that increases aromatase expression in bone would reduce the estrogen deprivation in bone caused by the AIs, thus ameliorating the AI-induced side effect of osteoporosis.</docText>

        <docText>Randomized phase III trial comparing docetaxel plus epirubicin versus docetaxel plus capecitabine as first-line treatment in women with advanced breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare docetaxel plus epirubicin versus docetaxel plus capecitabine combinations as front-line treatment in women with advanced breast cancer (ABC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with ABC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) (DE) on day 1 or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus capecitabine 950 mg/m(2) orally twice daily on days 1-14 (DC) in 21-day cycles. Previous anthracycline-based (neo)-adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed if completed &gt;1 year before enrollment. The primary objective of the study was to compare time to disease progression (TTP). RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six women were treated on each arm and median TTP was 10.6 versus 11.0 months (P = 0.7), for DE and DC, respectively. According to RECIST criteria we observed 15 (11%) versus 11 (8%) complete responses and 55 (40%) versus 61 (45%) partial responses (P = 0.8), with DE and DC, respectively. Severe toxicity included grade 3-4 neutropenia (57% versus 46%; P = 0.07), febrile neutropenia (11% versus 8%; P = 0.4), hand-foot syndrome (0% versus 4%; P = 0.02), grade 2-3 anemia (20% versus 7%; P = 0.001) and asthenia (12% versus 6%; P = 0.09) with DE and DC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The DE and DC regimens have similar efficacy but different toxicity. Either regimen can be used as front-line treatment of ABC.</docText>

        <docTitle>On Combining Morphological Component Analysis and Concentric Morphology Model for Mammographic Mass Detection.</docTitle>
        <docText>On Combining Morphological Component Analysis and Concentric Morphology Model for Mammographic Mass Detection.

Mammographic mass detection is an important task for the early diagnosis of the breast cancer. However, it is difficult to distinguish masses from normal regions because of their abundant morphological characteristics and ambiguous margins. To improve the mass detection performance, it is essential to effectively preprocess mammogram to preserve both the intensity distribution and morphological characteristics of regions. In this paper, morphological component analysis (MCA) is firstly introduced to decompose a mammogram into a piecewise smooth component and a texture component. The former is utilized in our detection scheme, because it effectively suppresses both structural noises and effects of blood-vessels. Then, we propose two novel concentric layer criteria to detect different types of suspicious regions in a mammogram. The combination is evaluated based on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography, where 100 malignant cases and 50 benign cases are utilized. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme is 99% in malignant, 88% in benign and 95.3% in all types of cases. The results show that the proposed detection scheme achieves satisfied detection performance and preferable compromises between sensitivity and false positive rates.</docText>

        <docText>Adjuvant capecitabine in combination with docetaxel and cyclophosphamide plus epirubicin for breast cancer: an open-label, randomised controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for patients with moderate-to-high-risk early breast cancer typically contain a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide. We aimed to investigate whether integration of capecitabine into such a regimen enhances outcome. METHODS: In this open-label trial, we randomly assigned (centrally by computer; stratified by node status, HER2 status, and centre) 1500 women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer to either three cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (capecitabine group, n=753), or to three cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (control group, n=747). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. A planned interim analysis was done after 3 years' median follow-up. Efficacy analyses were by modified intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00114816. FINDINGS: Two patients in each group were excluded from efficacy analyses because of withdrawal of consent or distant metastases. After a median follow-up of 35 months (IQR 25.5-43.6), recurrence-free survival at 3 years was better with the capecitabine regimen than with control (93%vs 89%; hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.94; p=0.020). The capecitabine regimen was associated with more cases of grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (46/740 [6%] vs 25/741 [3%]) and hand-foot syndrome (83/741 [11%] vs 2/741 [&lt;1%]) and the control regimen with more occurrences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (368/375 [98%] vs 325/378 [86%]) and febrile neutropenia (65/741 [9%] vs 33/742 [4%]). More patients discontinued planned treatment in the capecitabine group than in the control group (178/744 [24%] vs 23/741 [3%]). Four patients in the capecitabine group and two in the control group died from potentially treatment-related causes. INTERPRETATION: The capecitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen reduced breast cancer recurrence compared with a control schedule of standard agents. Capecitabine administration was frequently discontinued because of adverse effects. FUNDING: Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, AstraZeneca, Cancer Society of Finland.</docText>

        <docText>A randomised, controlled trial of the psychological effects of reflexology in early breast cancer.

PURPOSE: To conduct a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of reflexology on quality of life (QofL) in women with early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three women were randomised 6 weeks post-breast surgery to self-initiated support (SIS) (comparator intervention), SIS plus reflexology, or SIS plus scalp massage (control for physical and social contact). Reflexology and massage comprised eight sessions at weekly intervals. The primary end-point was 18 weeks post surgery; the primary outcome measure was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-B) - breast cancer version. The secondary end-point was 24 weeks post surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Mood Rating Scale (MRS). RESULTS: At primary end-point, massage, but not reflexology, was significantly better than SIS on the TOI. Reflexology and massage were both better than SIS for MRS relaxation. Massage was better than reflexology and SIS for MRS easygoingness. At secondary end-point, reflexology, but not massage, was better than SIS on the TOI and MRS relaxation. There were no significant differences between reflexology or massage. There were no significant between group differences in HADS anxiety and depression. Self-reported use of out of study complementary therapies indicated that this was unlikely to have a significant effect on findings. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to SIS, reflexology and massage have statistically significant, and, for reflexology, clinically worthwhile, effects on QofL following surgery for early breast carcinoma.</docText>

        <docText>In vivo tumour and metastasis reduction and in vitro effects on invasion assays of the ruthenium RM175 and osmium AFAP51 organometallics in the mammary cancer model.

We have compared the organometallic arene complexes [(eta(6)-biphenyl)M(ethylenediamine)Cl](+) RM175 (M=Ru(II)) and its isostructural osmium(II) analogue AFAP51 (M=Os(II)) for their ability to induce cell detachment resistance from fibronectin, collagen IV and poly-l-lysine, and cell re-adhesion after treatment, their effects on cell migration and cell viability, on matrix metalloproteinases production, and on primary tumour growth of MCa mammary carcinoma, the effect of human serum albumin on their cytotoxicity. There are differences between ruthenium and osmium. The Os complex is up to 6x more potent than RM175 towards highly-invasive breast MDA-MB-231, human breast MCF-7 and human epithelial HBL-100 cancer cells, but whereas RM175 was active against MCa mammary carcinoma in vivo and caused metastasis reduction, AFAP51 was not. Intriguingly the presence of human serum albumin in the growth medium enhanced the cytotoxicity of both compounds. RM175 increased the resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells to detachment from substrates and both compounds inhibited the production of MMP-2. These data confirm the key role of ruthenium itself in anti-metastatic activity. It will be interesting to explore the activity of osmium arene complexes in other tumour models and the possibility of changing the non-arene ligands to tune the anticancer activity of osmium in vivo.</docText>

        <docText>Optical imaging of the peri-tumoral inflammatory response in breast cancer.

ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: Peri-tumoral inflammation is a common tumor response that plays a central role in tumor invasion and metastasis, and inflammatory cell recruitment is essential to this process. The purpose of this study was to determine whether injected fluorescently-labeled monocytes accumulate within murine breast tumors and are visible with optical imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine monocytes were labeled with the fluorescent dye DiD and subsequently injected intravenously into 6 transgenic MMTV-PymT tumor-bearing mice and 6 FVB/n control mice without tumors. Optical imaging (OI) was performed before and after cell injection. Ratios of post-injection to pre-injection fluorescent signal intensity of the tumors (MMTV-PymT mice) and mammary tissue (FVB/n controls) were calculated and statistically compared. RESULTS: MMTV-PymT breast tumors had an average post/pre signal intensity ratio of 1.8+/- 0.2 (range 1.1-2.7). Control mammary tissue had an average post/pre signal intensity ratio of 1.1 +/- 0.1 (range, 0.4 to 1.4). The p-value for the difference between the ratios was less than 0.05. Confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of DiD-labeled cells within the breast tumors. CONCLUSION: Murine monocytes accumulate at the site of breast cancer development in this transgenic model, providing evidence that peri-tumoral inflammatory cell recruitment can be evaluated non-invasively using optical imaging.</docText>

        <docText>Ku proteins interact with activator protein-2 transcription factors and contribute to ERBB2 overexpression in breast cancer cell lines.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Activator protein-2 (AP-2) alpha and AP-2 gamma transcription factors contribute to ERBB2 gene overexpression in breast cancer. In order to understand the mechanism by which the ERBB2 gene is overexpressed we searched for novel AP-2 interacting factors that contribute to its activity. METHODS: Ku proteins were identified as AP-2 alpha interacting proteins by glutathione serine transferase (GST)-pull down followed by mass spectrometry. Transfection of the cells with siRNA, expression vectors and reporter vectors as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were used to ascertain the implication of Ku proteins on ERBB2 expression. RESULTS: Nuclear proteins from BT-474 cells overexpressing AP-2 alpha and AP-2 gamma were incubated with GST-AP2 or GST coated beads. Among the proteins retained specifically on GST-AP2 coated beads Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The contribution of Ku proteins to ERBB2 gene expression in BT-474 and SKBR3 cell lines was investigated by downregulating Ku proteins through the use of specific siRNAs. Depletion of Ku proteins led to downregulation of ERBB2 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, reduction of Ku80 in HCT116 cell line decreased the AP-2 alpha activity on a reporter vector containing an AP-2 binding site linked to the ERBB2 core promoter, and transfection of Ku80 increased the activity of AP-2 alpha on this promoter. Ku siRNAs also inhibited the activity of this reporter vector in BT-474 and SKBR3 cell lines and the activity of the ERBB2 promoter was further reduced by combining Ku siRNAs with AP-2 alpha and AP-2 gamma siRNAs. ChIP experiments with chromatin extracted from wild type or AP-2 alpha and AP-2 gamma or Ku70 siRNA transfected BT-474 cells demonstrated Ku70 recruitment to the ERBB2 proximal promoter in association with AP-2 alpha and AP-2 gamma. Moreover, Ku70 siRNA like AP-2 siRNAs, greatly reduced PolII recruitment to the ERBB2 proximal promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Ku proteins in interaction with AP-2 (alpha and gamma) contribute to increased ERBB2 mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer cells.</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic regulation of CD24 and the invasive, CD44posCD24neg phenotype in breast cancer cell lines.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The invasive, mesenchymal phenotype of CD44posCD24neg breast cancer cells has made them a promising target for eliminating the metastatic capacity of primary tumors. It has been previously demonstrated that CD44neg/lowCD24pos breast cancer cells lack the ability to give rise to their invasive CD44posCD24neg counterpart. Here we demonstrate that noninvasive, epithelial-like CD44posCD24pos cells readily give rise to invasive, mesenchymal CD44posCD24neg progeny in vivo and in vitro. This interconversion was found to be dependent upon Activin/Nodal signaling. METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were sorted into CD44posCD24pos and CD44posCD24neg populations to evaluate their progeny for the expression of CD44, CD24, and markers of a mesenchymal phenotype. The populations, separated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) were injected into immunocompromised mice to evaluate their tumorigenicity and invasiveness of the resulting xenografts. RESULTS: CD24 expression was dynamically regulated in vitro in all evaluated breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, a single noninvasive, epithelial-like CD44posCD24pos cell had the ability to give rise to invasive, mesenchymal CD44posCD24neg progeny. Importantly, this interconversion occurred in vivo as CD44posCD24pos cells gave rise to xenografts with locally invasive borders as seen in xenografts initiated with CD44posCD24neg cells. Lastly, the ability of CD44posCD24pos cells to give rise to mesenchymal progeny, and vice versa, was blocked upon ablation of Activin/Nodal signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the invasive, mesenchymal CD44posCD24neg phenotype is under dynamic control in breast cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our observations suggest that therapies targeting CD44posCD24neg tumor cells may have limited success in preventing primary tumor metastasis unless Activin/Nodal signaling is arrested.</docText>

        <docText>'We've fallen into the cracks': Aboriginal women's experiences with breast cancer through photovoice.

Despite some recognition that Aboriginal women who have experienced breast cancer may have unique health needs, little research has documented the experiences of Aboriginal women from their perspective. Our main objective was to explore and to begin to make visible Aboriginal women's experiences with breast cancer using the qualitative research technique, photovoice. The research was based in Saskatchewan, Canada and participants were Aboriginal women who had completed breast cancer treatment. Although Aboriginal women cannot be viewed as a homogeneous group, participants indicated two areas of priority for health-care: (i) Aboriginal identity and traditional beliefs, although expressed in diverse ways, are an important dimension of breast cancer experiences and have relevance for health-care; and (ii) there is a need for multidimensional support which addresses larger issues of racism, power and socioeconomic inequality. We draw upon a critical and feminist conception of visuality to interrogate and disrupt the dominant visual terrain (both real and metaphorical) where Aboriginal women are either invisible or visible in disempowering ways. Aboriginal women who have experienced breast cancer must be made visible within health-care in a way that recognizes their experiences situated within the structural context of marginalization through colonial oppression.</docText>

        <docText>Progestagen component in combined hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women and breast cancer risk: a debated clinical issue.

The relevance of the progestagen component in combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for breast cancer risk has been long debated. In vitro studies have shown that progestins exert both genomic transcriptional and non-genomic effects that can enhance the proliferation, invasiveness and spread of breast cancer cells. According to a novel hypothesis, progestins can still activate cancer stem cells in patients with pre-existing, clinically undetected breast cancer. However, some experimental and clinical data suggest that different progestins may have a different impact on the pathophysiology of malignant breast cells. In vitro studies on estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells have shown that the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to estradiol (E(2)) produces a significantly higher increase of the mRNA levels and activities of estrogen-activating enzymes aromatase, 17beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 and sulfatase when compared with progesterone plus E(2). In randomised trial performed on ovariectomised adult female monkeys, oral E(2) plus MPA have resulted in a significantly greater proliferation of breast lobular and ductal epithelium when compared with placebo, whereas E(2) plus micronised progesterone have not. In the same experimental model, oral E(2) plus MPA have been found to induce the expression of genes encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and downstream targets, whereas E(2) alone or E(2) plus micronised progesterone had no or modest effects on EGFR-related genes. In last years, some clinical studies on HRT users have shown that androgenic progestin- or MPA-based formulations are associated with an increased breast cancer incidence, whereas micronised progesterone- or dydrogesterone-based formulations are not. Further basic and clinical investigations on this topic are strongly warranted to elucidate whether the choice of the progestagen component in combined HRT could be of clinical relevance as for breast cancer risk.</docText>

        <docText>Risk of gynecological cancers in users of estradiol/dydrogesterone or other HRT preparations.

OBJECTIVES: Use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been associated with an elevated risk of gynecological cancers. There is evidence that the effect differs with the type of hormone used. Dydrogesterone is pharmacologically very similar to progesterone. METHODS: We used the UK-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to conduct a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis. We assessed and compared the risk of developing breast, ovarian, endometrial/uterine or cervical cancer in estradiol/dydrogesterone (E/D) users, users of other HRT, or non-users of HRT. RESULTS: The breast cancer incidence rates were 2.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.81-3.15), 3.28 (95% CI 3.01-3.55) and 3.16 (95% CI 2.92-3.42) per 1000 person-years for E/D users, users of other HRT or non-users, respectively. In a direct comparison, the breast cancer risk for E/D users was lower than for users of other HRT (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.05). The incidence rates of other gynecological cancers were similar or also slightly lower for E/D users than for users of other HRT. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the risk of developing gynecological cancers with E/D use of several months to a few years is similar to the risks of developing gynecological cancer without HRT or use of other HRT.</docText>

        <docText>Acid ceramidase 1 expression correlates with a better prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer.

OBJECTIVES: Ceramide and sphingosine mediate response to cancer therapy, inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in vitro. Only a few clinical data about the impact of ceramide and sphingosine iny vivo are available. We investigated the relevance of ceramide- and sphingosine-generating enzymes in breast cancer (acid ceramidase 1 (ASAH1), ceramide synthases 4 (LASS4) and 6 (LASS6)) by means of gene expression analysis. METHODS: We analyzed differences in ASAH1, LASS4 and LASS6 on mRNA level between breast cancer subgroups using microarray data from 1581 tumor samples. RESULTS: High ASAH1, LASS4 and LASS6 expression correlates with pathohistological grading (p &lt; 0.001) and estrogen receptor (ER) status (p &lt; 0.001). High ASAH1 expression was associated with a larger tumor size &gt;2 cm (p = 0.003), while high LASS6 expression was correlated with ErbB2 negativity (p &lt; 0.001). In survival analysis, we detected a significant better prognosis of patients with higher ASAH1 expression (p = 0.002) in the ER-positive subgroup. In contrast, expression of LASS4 or LASS6 did not show any prognostic impact. In the multivariate analysis, only ASAH1 expression (p = 0.002), tumor size (p &lt; 0.0001) and ErbB2 positivity (p = 0.041) remained significant. CONCLUSION: ASAH1 is an estrogen-dependent member of the sphingolipid metabolism, which might provide further prognostic information in ER-positive breast cancers.</docText>

        <docText>Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: attitudes of women eligible in a randomized trial.

Objectives To investigate the attitudes of breast cancer patients who accepted or declined participation in a randomized trial with hormone replacement therapy that might increase their risk of recurrence (the Stockholm trial). Methods A total of 115 patients free from breast cancer recurrence were interviewed; 57 were participants and 58 were non-participants in the Stockholm trial. Patients answered five questionnaires regarding information needs (two), attitudes to participation in trials (two) and patient role in treatment decisions (one). Results Participants in the Stockholm trial had a lower risk of breast cancer recurrence (measured by node-positive disease and tumor size) and were older than non-participants. Their information needs were the same. Participants in the trial were more prepared to accept uncertainty, to have an altruistic attitude, to accept risks including an increased risk of recurrence of breast cancer, if their quality of life or general health was improved. Most patients preferred a collaborative role in relation to their physician but participants often wanted more influence than they had in treatment decisions. Conclusion A patient's decision to accept or decline participation in the Stockholm trial was influenced by her objective risk of breast cancer recurrence and reflected her attitude to risk, uncertainty and preference to be active in treatment decisions.</docText>

        <docText>Liposomes with high encapsulation capacity for paclitaxel: Preparation, characterisation and in vivo anticancer effect.

Paclitaxel (PTX) is approved for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer. The commercially available preparation of PTX, Cremophor EL(R) is associated with hypersensitivity reactions in spite of a suitable premedication. In general, the developed liposomal PTX formulations are troubled with low PTX encapsulation capacity (maximal content, 3 mol%) and accompanied by PTX crystallisation. The application of "pocket-forming" lipids significantly increased the encapsulation capacity of PTX in the liposomes up to 10 mol%. Stable lyophilised preparation of PTX (7 mol%) encapsulated in the liposomes composed of SOPC/POPG/MOPC (molar ratio, 60:20:20) doped with 5 mol% vitamin E had the size distribution of 180-190 nm (PDI, 0.1) with zeta-potential of -31 mV. Sucrose was found to be a suitable cryoprotectant at the lipid:sugar molar ratios of 1:5-1:10. This liposomal formulation did not show any evidence of toxicity in C57BL/6 mice treated with the highest doses of PTX (100 mg/kg administered as a single dose and 150 mg/kg as a cumulative dose applied in three equivalent doses in 48-h intervals). A dose-dependent anticancer effect was found in both hollow fibre implants and syngenic B16F10 melanoma mouse tumour models.

        <docText>Multifunctional Silver-Embedded Magnetic Nanoparticles as SERS Nanoprobes and Their Applications.

In this study, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-encoded magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared and utilized as a multifunctional tagging material for cancer-cell targeting and separation. First, silver-embedded magnetic NPs are prepared, composed of an 18-nm magnetic core and a 16-nm-thick silica shell with silver NPs formed on the surface. After simple aromatic compounds are adsorbed on the silver-embedded magnetic NPs, they are coated with silica to provide them with chemical and physical stability. The resulting silica-encapsulated magnetic NPs (M-SERS dots) produce strong SERS signals and have magnetic properties. In a model application as a tagging material, the M-SERS dots are successfully utilized for targeting breast-cancer cells (SKBR3) and floating leukemia cells (SP2/O). The targeted cancer cells can be easily separated from the untargeted cells using an external magnetic field. The separated targeted cancer cells exhibit a Raman signal originating from the M-SERS dots. This system proves to be an efficient tool for separating targeted cells. Additionally, the magnetic-field-induced hot spots, which can provide a 1000-times-stronger SERS intensity due to aggregation of the NPs, are studied.</docText>

        <docText>High CCND1 amplification identifies a group of poor prognosis women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.

CCND1 encodes for the cyclin D1 protein involved in G1/S cell cycle transition. In breast cancer the mechanism of CCND1 amplification, relationship between cyclin D1 protein expression and the key clinical markers estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 requires elucidation. Tissue microarrays of primary invasive breast cancer from 93 women were evaluated for CCND1 amplification by fluorescent in-situ hybridisation and cyclin D1 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. CCND1 amplification was identified in 27/93 (30%) cancers and 59/93 (63%) cancers had overexpression of cyclin D1. CCND1 amplification was significantly associated with cyclin D1 protein overexpression (p&lt;0.001; Fisher's exact test) and both CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 protein expression with oestrogen receptor (ER) expression (p=0.003 and p&lt;0.001; Fishers exact test). Neither CCND1 amplification nor cyclinD1 expression was associated with tumour size, pathological node status or HER2 amplification, but high CCND1 amplification (Copy Number Gain (CNG) &gt;/= 8) was associated with high tumour grade (p=0.005; chi square 7.915, 2df) and worse prognosis by Nottingham Prognostic Index (p=0.001; 2 sample t-test). High CCND1 amplification (CNG &gt;/= 8) may identify a subset of patients with poor prognosis ER-positive breast cancers who should be considered for additional therapy. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docText>Tumor angiogenesis and novel antiangiogenic strategies.

Angiogenesis is essential for the development and growth of tumors. It is a highly regulated process that requires cross-talk between signaling pathways at all stages of blood vessel development and tumor growth, from the recruitment of endothelial cells to vessel maturation. This review summarizes tumor angiogenesis and describes the key signaling pathways governing blood vessel development. The role of angiogenesis in various tumor types is discussed, but the focus is on invasive breast cancer, a disease that will affect approximately 182,000 women in the USA in 2008. Research efforts over the past decade have identified numerous potential, as well as proven, therapies with activity in breast cancer. These include chemotherapeutics as well as therapies that inhibit specific angiogenic pathways known as targeted agents. Some of the data from single- and multitargeted antiangiogenic agents are described in this review. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docText>What determines age-related disease: do we know all the right questions?

The average human lifespan has increased throughout the last century due to the mitigation of many infectious diseases. More people now die of age-related diseases than ever before, but these diseases have been resistant to elimination. Progress has been made in treatments and preventative measures to delay the onsets of these diseases, but most cancers and vascular diseases are still with us and they kill about the same fraction of the population year after year. For example, US Caucasian female deaths from breast plus genital cancers have remained a fairly constant ~7% of the age-related disease deaths from 1938 to 1998 and have been consistently ~2-fold greater than female colon plus rectal cancer deaths over that span. This type of stability pattern pervades the age-related diseases and suggests that intrinsic properties within populations determine these fractions. Recognizing this pattern and deciphering its origin will be necessary for the complete understanding of these major causes of death. It would appear that more than the random processes of aging drive this effect. The question is how to meaningfully approach this problem. This commentary discusses the epidemiological and aging perspectives and their current limitations in providing an explanation. The age of bioinformatics offers hope, but only if creative systems approaches are forthcoming.</docText>

        <docText>Leptomeningeal metastases from prostate cancer: an emerging clinical conundrum.

Leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors are relatively uncommon events with dismal prognosis. They can be seen mainly in patients with breast and lung cancer, and malignant melanoma, but have also been described in a variety of other tumor types. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from prostate cancer is an extremely rare complication, but as patients' survival is prolonged due to more effective treatments, it is expected that more patients will present with leptomeningeal involvement in advanced stages of the disease. In these cases high levels of prostate-specific antigen can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid. This comprehensive review presents the recent findings from the literature.</docText>

        <docText>Prediction of outcome of patients with metastatic breast cancer: evaluation with prognostic factors and Nottingham prognostic index.

GOALS OF WORK: The purpose of this study is to analyze the survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer and to evaluate the outcome of these patients using prognostic factors and Nottingham prognostic index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 1992 to August 2008, 135 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated at the Changhua Christian Hospital. In these patients, we evaluated the significance of the following factors in predicting the survival rate after the occurrence of metastasis: age, initial stage at primary diagnosis, histological grade, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor status, human epidermoid growth factor receptor 2 overexpression status, number of axillary lymph node metastasis, history of adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, disease-free interval, status of local recurrence, status of various sites of distant metastases, number of distant metastases, and Nottingham prognostic index. MAIN RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 53.3%, 25.2%, and 1.5%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, KPS, histological grade, ER status, initial stage at primary diagnosis, number of axillary lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, disease-free interval, first-/second-/third-line chemotherapy for recurrence or metastasis, number of metastases, and Nottingham prognostic index had significant impact on survival. The median survival of patients determined as corresponding to Nottingham low-risk group, intermediate-risk group, and high-risk group was 29.3, 17.9, and 4.6 months, respectively. In our multivariate analysis, Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.030) and Nottingham prognostic index (p &lt;/= 0.0001) were significant prognostic factors for survival, while first-/second-/third-line chemotherapy for recurrence or metastasis (p = 0.002) was a significant predictor for the outcome of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with metastatic breast cancer is poor. In spite of the fact that many advances in treatment have been made, numerous additional questions have arisen; new drugs and therapeutic regimens are needed to improve the outcomes of patients, and further well-designed randomized trials are warranted.</docText>

        <docText>Preclinical study of prolonged administration of trastuzumab as combination therapy after disease progression during trastuzumab monotherapy.

PURPOSE: The clinical relevance of prolonged trastuzumab administration in combination therapy beyond progressive disease (PD) has been suggested. Here, we examined whether trastuzumab treatment is effective in combination after failing to show antitumor activity as monotherapy in HER2-positive human breast cancer xenograft models. METHODS: We established trastuzumab PD models with HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft models and compared the antitumor activity of trastuzumab in combination with a taxane versus monotherapy with a taxane in the models subsequent to tumor progression under trastuzumab monotherapy. RESULTS: We established trastuzumab PD model using the HER2-positive human breast cancer line MDA-MB-361 and KPL-4 in in vivo. In these models, trastuzumab at the same dose as the initial treatment showed no significant antitumor activity at 3 weeks after start of treatment. Re-inoculated tumor tissues showing PD regained sensitivity to trastuzumab. In the trastuzumab PD models, the HER2 status of the tumor tissues did not decrease. Also, the pAKT level continued to decrease, as with the initial treatment, and IGF-1R was not found to be up-regulated. Instead, differences were observed in the gene-expression profiles of the tumor tissues showing PD. Trastuzumab in combination with G-CSF, which is expected to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), showed significant antitumor activity, even though the single agents alone showed no antitumor activity in the PD model. In the MDA-MB-361 trastuzumab PD model, the combination of trastuzumab with paclitaxel showed significantly more potent antitumor activity compared with paclitaxel or docetaxel monotherapy. In the KPL-4 trastuzumab PD model as well, trastuzumab showed significant antitumor activity in combination with taxanes or capecitabine after PD had developed in response to trastuzumab monotherapy. CONCLUSION: We established in vivo trastuzumab PD models, in which trastuzumab monotherapy ceases to have antitumor activity during the treatment. The mechanisms of PD with trastuzumab are considered to involve both reversible changes in the gene expression profiles in tumor tissues and a decrease of ADCC activity in the host. Our present results demonstrated that trastuzumab showed antitumor activity in combination with taxanes or capecitabine even though it showed no antitumor activity as a monotherapy, suggesting a clinical relevance of treatment with trastuzumab as a combination therapy beyond PD.</docText>

        <docText>Identification and characterization of a HER-2/neu epitope as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.

Our aim is to develop peptide vaccines that stimulate tumor antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses against frequently detected cancers. We describe herein a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope, encompassing amino acids 828-836 (residues QIAKGMSYL), which is naturally presented by various HER-2/neu (+) tumor cell lines. HER-2/neu(828-836), [HER-2(9(828))], possesses two anchor residues and stabilized HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells in a concentration-dependent Class I binding assay. This peptide was stable for 3.5 h in an off-kinetic assay. HER-2(9(828)) was found to be immunogenic in HLA-A*0201 transgenic (HHD) mice inducing peptide-specific and functionally potent CTL and long-lasting anti-tumor immunity. Most important, using HLA-A*0201 pentamer analysis we could detect increased ex vivo frequencies of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes specifically recognizing HER-2(9(828)) in 8 out of 20 HLA-A*0201(+) HER-2/neu (+) breast cancer patients. Moreover, HER-2(9(828))-specific human CTL recognized the tumor cell line SKOV3.A2 as well as the primary RS.A2.1.DR1 tumor cell line both expressing HER-2/neu and HLA-A*0201. Finally, therapeutic vaccination with HER-2(9(828)) in HHD mice was proven effective against established transplantable ALC.A2.1.HER tumors, inducing complete tumor regression in 50% of mice. Our data encourage further exploitation of HER-2(9(828)) as a promising candidate for peptide-based cancer vaccines.</docText>

        <docText>Consumption of animal products, their nutrient components and postmenopausal circulating steroid hormone concentrations.

Background/Objectives:Little is known about nutritional factors that influence circulating concentrations of steroid hormones, which are consistently associated with risk of breast cancer for postmenopausal women. We aimed to investigate the association between consumption of animal products and the plasma concentrations of steroid hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).Subjects/Methods:Cross-sectional analysis was conducted on plasma from 766 naturally postmenopausal women. We measured plasma concentrations of steroid hormones and SHBG, and estimated dietary intakes using a 121-item food frequency questionnaire. Log-transformed values of hormone concentrations were regressed on quartiles of intake of meat and dairy products among food items, and fats, proteins and cholesterol among nutrient intake.Results:Total red and fresh red meat consumption was negatively associated with SHBG levels (P for trend=0.04 and &lt;0.01, respectively). Mean SHBG concentrations were approximately 8% and 13% lower for women in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of total red and fresh red meat consumption, respectively. Positive associations were observed between dairy product consumption and total and free estradiol concentrations (P for trend=0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Mean concentrations of total and free estradiol were 15 and 14% higher for women in the highest quartile of dairy product consumption than for those in the lowest quartile, respectively. No associations were observed with consumption of processed meat, chicken, fish, eggs, cholesterol, fats or protein.Conclusions:Our study suggests that greater consumption of total red and fresh red meat and dairy products might influence circulating concentrations of SHBG and estradiol, respectively. Confirmation and further investigation is required.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 11 November 2009; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2009.129.</docText>

A substantial part of all hereditary breast cancer cases is caused by BRCA1 germline mutations. In this review, we will discuss the insights into BRCA1 functions that we obtained from mouse models with conventional and conditional mutations in Brca1. The most advanced models closely resemble human BRCA1-related breast cancer and may therefore be useful for addressing clinically relevant questions.</docText>

        <docText>Age of onset in familial breast cancer as background data for medical surveillance.

Background:Familial breast cancers are known to be of early onset. This article provides differences in the age of onset of breast cancer and death by breast cancer between women with and without a family history.Methods:The Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to estimate the cumulative risk of breast cancer and death by breast cancer according to family history with a stratified Cox model. Family history was defined separately for affected mother or sister considering their diagnostic ages.Results:The age to reach the same cumulative incidence as women without family history decreased with decreasing diagnostic age of the affected relative. Women with a maternal history reached the risk of women lacking a family history at the age of 50 years between 12.3 (mother affected &lt;40 years) and 3.3 years (mother affected &gt;82 years) earlier. The trend for breast cancer mortality was essentially similar.Conclusions:Women with mother or sister affected by breast cancer are diagnosed and die at earlier ages than do women without family history. The differences depend on the diagnostic age of the affected relative. The present data may provide a rationale to derive recommendations for the starting age of screening in women with affected family members.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 10 November 2009; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605421 www.bjcancer.com.</docText>

        <docText>CITED2 and NCOR2 in anti-oestrogen resistance and progression of breast cancer.

Background:Endocrine therapies of breast cancer are effective but ultimately fail because of the development of treatment resistance. We have previously revealed several genes leading to tamoxifen resistance in vitro by retroviral insertion mutagenesis. To understand the manner in which these genes yield tamoxifen resistance, their effects on global gene expression were studied and those genes resulting in a distinct gene expression profile were further investigated for their clinical relevance.Methods:Gene expression profiles of 69 human breast cancer cell lines that were made tamoxifen resistant through retroviral insertion mutagenesis were obtained using oligonucleotide arrays and analysed with bioinformatic tools. mRNA levels of NCOR2 and CITED2 in oestrogen receptor-positive breast tumours were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA levels were evaluated for association with metastasis-free survival (MFS) in 620 patients with lymph node-negative primary breast cancer who did not receive systemic adjuvant therapy, and with clinical benefit in 296 patients receiving tamoxifen therapy for recurrent breast cancer.Results:mRNA expression profiles of most tamoxifen-resistant cell lines were strikingly similar, except for the subgroups of cell lines in which NCOR2 or CITED2 were targeted by the retrovirus. Both NCOR2 and CITED2 mRNA levels were associated with MFS, that is, tumour aggressiveness, independently of traditional prognostic factors. In addition, high CITED2 mRNA levels were predictive for a clinical benefit from first-line tamoxifen treatment in patients with advanced disease.Conclusions:Most retrovirally targeted genes yielding tamoxifen resistance in our cell lines do not impose a distinctive expression profile, suggesting that their causative role in cell growth may be accomplished by post-transcriptional processes. The associations of NCOR2 and CITED2 with outcome in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients underscore the clinical relevance of functional genetic screens to better understand disease progression, which may ultimately lead to the development of improved treatment options.</docText>

        <docText>Prevalence of and factors associated with persistent pain following breast cancer surgery.

CONTEXT: Persistent pain and sensory disturbances following surgical treatment for breast cancer is a significant clinical problem. The pathogenic mechanisms are complex and may be related to patient characteristics, surgical technique, and adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine prevalence of and factors associated with persistent pain after surgical treatment for breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire study of 3754 women aged 18 to 70 years who received surgery and adjuvant therapy (if indicated) for primary breast cancer in Denmark between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2006. A study questionnaire was sent to the women between January and April 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence, location, and severity of persistent pain and sensory disturbances in 12 well-defined treatment groups assessed an average of 26 months after surgery, and adjusted odds ratio (OR) of reported pain and sensory disturbances with respect to age, surgical technique, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. RESULTS: By June 2008, 3253 of 3754 eligible women (87%) returned the questionnaire. A total of 1543 patients (47%) reported pain, of whom 201 (13%) had severe pain, 595 (39%) had moderate pain, and 733 (48%) had light pain. Factors associated with chronic pain included young age (18-39 years: OR, 3.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.25-5.82; P &lt; .001) and adjuvant radiotherapy (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.08-2.07; P = .03), but not chemotherapy (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85-1.21; P = .91). Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was associated with increased likelihood of pain (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.43-2.19; P &lt; .001) compared with sentinel lymph node dissection. Risk of sensory disturbances was associated with young age (18-39 years: OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 2.87-8.69; P &lt; .001) and ALND (OR, 4.97; 95% CI, 3.92-6.30; P &lt; .001). Pain complaints from other parts of the body were associated with increased risk of pain in the surgical area (P &lt; .001). A total of 306 patients (20%) with pain had contacted a physician within the prior 3 months for pain complaints in the surgical area. CONCLUSION: Two to 3 years after breast cancer treatment, persistent pain and sensory disturbances remain clinically significant problems among Danish women who received surgery in 2005 and 2006.</docText>

Since its original cloning by subtraction hybridization in 2002, it is now evident that Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is a key contributor to the carcinogenic process in diverse organs. AEG-1 protein expression is elevated in advanced stages of many cancers, which correlates with poor survival. In specific cancers, such as breast and liver cancer, the AEG-1 gene itself is amplified, further supporting a seminal role in tumorigenesis. Overexpression and inhibition studies both in in vitro and in in vivo models reveal the importance of AEG-1 in regulating multiple physiologically and pathologically relevant processes including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and gene expression. AEG-1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with multiple nuclear localization signals and no known domains or motifs. Although pertinent roles of AEG-1 in the carcinogenic process are established, its potential function (promotion of metastasis only versus functioning as a bona fide oncogene) as well as localization (cell surface versus nucleus) remain areas requiring further clarification. The present review critically evaluates what is currently known about AEG-1 and provides new perspectives relative to this intriguing molecule that may provide a rational target for intervening in the cancer phenotype.</docText>

        <docTitle>Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 2, a Novel Negative Regulator of the p53 Tumor Suppressor.</docTitle>
        <docText>Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 2, a Novel Negative Regulator of the p53 Tumor Suppressor.

Breast cancer amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) was reported previously as a transcriptional coactivator of estrogen receptor. Here, we report that BCAS2 directly interacts with p53 to reduce p53 transcriptional activity by mildly but consistently decreasing p53 protein in the absence of DNA damage. However, in the presence of DNA damage, BCAS2 prominently reduces p53 protein and provides protection against chemotherapeutic agent such as doxorubicin. Deprivation of BCAS2 induces apoptosis in p53 wild-type cells but causes G(2)-M arrest in p53-null or p53 mutant cells. There are at least two apoptosis mechanisms induced by silencing BCAS2 in wild-type p53-containing cells. Firstly, it increases p53 retention in nucleus that triggers the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Secondly, it increases p53 transcriptional activity by raising p53 phosphorylation at Ser(46) and decreases p53 protein degradation by reducing p53 phosphorylation at Ser(315). We show for the first time that BCAS2, a small nuclear protein (26 kDa), is a novel negative regulator of p53 and hence a potential molecular target for cancer therapy.

        <docText>Differential Enhancement of Breast Cancer Cell Motility and Metastasis by Helical and Kinase Domain Mutations of Class IA Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase.

Class IA (p85/p110) phosphoinositide 3-kinases play a major role in regulating cell growth, survival, and motility. Activating mutations in the p110alpha isoform of the class IA catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) are commonly found in human cancers. These mutations lead to increased proliferation and transformation in cultured cells, but their effects on cell motility and tumor metastasis have not been evaluated. We used lentiviral-mediated gene transfer and knockdown to produce stable MDA-MB-231 cells in which the endogenous human p110alpha is replaced with either wild-type bovine p110alpha or the two most common activating p110alpha mutants, the helical domain mutant E545K and the kinase domain mutant H1047R. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway was hyperactivated in cells expressing physiologic levels of helical or kinase domain mutants. Cells expressing either mutant showed increased motility in vitro, but only cells expressing the helical domain mutant showed increased directionality in a chemotaxis assay. In severe combined immunodeficient mice, xenograft tumors expressing either mutant showed increased rates of tumor growth compared with tumors expressing wild-type p110alpha. However, tumors expressing the p110alpha helical domain mutant showed a marked increase in both tumor cell intravasation into the blood and tumor cell extravasation into the lung after tail vein injection compared with tumors expressing wild-type p110alpha or the kinase domain mutant. Our observations suggest that, when compared with kinase domain mutations in a genetically identical background, expression of helical domain mutants of p110alpha produce a more severe metastatic phenotype.

        <docText>De novo Discovery of a {gamma}-Secretase Inhibitor Response Signature Using a Novel In vivo Breast Tumor Model.

Notch pathway signaling plays a fundamental role in normal biological processes and is frequently deregulated in many cancers. Although several hypotheses regarding cancer subpopulations most likely to respond to therapies targeting the Notch pathway have been proposed, clinical utility of these predictive markers has not been shown. To understand the molecular basis of gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) sensitivity in breast cancer, we undertook an unbiased, de novo responder identification study using a novel genetically engineered in vivo breast cancer model. We show that tumors arising from this model are heterogeneous on the levels of gene expression, histopathology, growth rate, expression of Notch pathway markers, and response to GSI treatment. In addition, GSI treatment of this model was associated with inhibition of Hes1 and proliferation markers, indicating that GSI treatment inhibits Notch signaling. We then identified a pretreatment gene expression signature comprising 768 genes that is significantly associated with in vivo GSI efficacy across 99 tumor lines. Pathway analysis showed that the GSI responder signature is enriched for Notch pathway components and inflammation/immune-related genes. These data show the power of this novel in vivo model system for the discovery of biomarkers predictive of response to targeted therapies, and provide a basis for the identification of human breast cancers most likely to be sensitive to GSI treatment.

        <docTitle>Patterns of Use and Risks Associated With Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents Among Medicare Patients With Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Patterns of Use and Risks Associated With Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents Among Medicare Patients With Cancer.

Background Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (erythropoietin and darbepoietin) have been approved to reduce the number of blood transfusions required during chemotherapy; however, concerns about the risks of venous thromboembolism and mortality exist. Methods We identified patients who were aged 65 years or older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database; who were diagnosed with colon, non-small cell lung, or breast cancer or with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2002; and who received chemotherapy. The main outcome measures were claims for use of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, blood transfusion, venous thromboembolism (ie, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), and overall survival. We used multivariable logistic regression models to analyze the association of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use with clinical and demographic variables. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to analyze the association of time to receipt of first erythropoiesis-stimulating agent with venous thromboembolism and overall survival. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Among 56 210 patients treated with chemotherapy from 1991 through 2002, 15 346 (27%) received an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. The proportion of patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents increased from 4.8% in 1991 to 45.9% in 2002 (P &lt; .001). Use was associated with more recent diagnosis, younger age, urban residence, comorbidities, receipt of radiation therapy, female sex, and metastatic or recurrent cancer. The rate of blood transfusion per year during 1991-2002 remained constant at 22%. Venous thromboembolism developed in 1796 (14.3%) of the 12 522 patients who received erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and 3400 (9.8%) of the 34 820 patients who did not (hazard ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval = 1.79 to 2.07). Overall survival was similar in both groups. Conclusion Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent increased rapidly after its approval in 1991, but the blood transfusion rate did not change. Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism but not of mortality.</docText>

        <docText>A novel toll-like receptor 9 agonist cooperates with trastuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant breast tumors through multiple mechanisms of action.

PURPOSE: Resistance to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab is a relevant issue in breast cancer patients. Among the mechanisms implicated in trastuzumab resistance, increasing evidence supports a role of tumor microenvironment. We previously found that a novel toll-like receptor 9 agonist, referred to as immune modulatory oligonucleotide (IMO) and currently under clinical investigation, acts through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and shows direct antiangiogenic effects by cooperating with anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF drugs, thus interfering with cancer cells and microenvironment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we used KPL-4 and JIMT-1 trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells to evaluate the combination IMO plus trastuzumab as a therapeutic option for trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers. RESULTS: IMO inhibits KPL-4 and JIMT-1 xenografts growth and potentiates trastuzumab antitumor effect, with complete suppression of tumor growth, potent enhancement of trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and strong inhibition of EGFR/HER2-related signaling. In KPL-4 xenografts, IMO alone interferes with HER signal transduction, whereas trastuzumab is ineffective. IMO induces an HER-dependent signal inhibition also in vitro by modulating a functional interaction between toll-like receptor 9 and HER receptors occurring at membrane level. Finally, IMO plus trastuzumab produces a cooperative antiangiogenic effect related to suppression of endothelial HER-related signaling. CONCLUSIONS: We showed a cooperative effect of IMO plus trastuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers due to IMO direct antitumor and antiangiogenic activity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity enhancement. Moreover, we provided first evidence of a toll-like receptor 9/HER interaction at membrane level as novel mechanism of action. Altogether, we propose IMO plus trastuzumab as an effective strategy in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers.</docText>

        <docText>p34SEI-1 inhibits doxorubicin-induced senescence through a pathway mediated by protein kinase C-delta and c-Jun-NH2-kinase 1 activation in human breast cancer MCF7 cells.

In this study, we describe a novel function of the p34(SEI-1) protein, which is both an oncogenic protein and a positive regulator of the cell cycle. The p34(SEI-1) protein was found to inhibit doxorubicin-induced senescence. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of p34(SEI-1) on senescence. First, we found that the activation of protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta), which is cleaved into a 38 kDa active form from a 78 kDa pro-form, induced after doxorubicin treatment, was inhibited by p34(SEI-1). Furthermore, p34(SEI-1) induced the ubiquitination of PKC-delta. Yet, there is no interaction between p34(SEI-1) and PKC-delta. We also found that the phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase 1 (JNK1) induced after doxorubicin treatment was suppressed by p34(SEI-1), but not in JNK2. Consistently, pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of either PKC-delta or JNK1 was found to inhibit doxorubicin-induced senescence. In addition, the genetic inactivation of PKC-delta by PKC-delta small interfering RNA resulted in an inhibition of JNK1 activation, but PKC-delta expression was not inactivated by JNK1 small interfering RNA, implying that the activation of JNK1 could be dependently induced by PKC-delta. Therefore, p34(SEI-1) inhibits senescence by inducing PKC-delta ubiquitination and preventing PKC-delta-dependent phosphorylation of JNK1.</docText>

        <docText>Inferring tumor progression from genomic heterogeneity.

Cancer progression in humans is difficult to infer because we do not routinely sample patients at multiple stages of their disease. However, heterogeneous breast tumors provide a unique opportunity to study human tumor progression because they still contain evidence of early and intermediate subpopulations in the form of the phylogenetic relationships. We have developed a method we call Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) to study the clonal composition of breast tumors. SPP involves macro-dissecting tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and profiling genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Breast carcinomas display two classes of genomic structural variation: (I) monogenomic and (II) polygenomic. Monogenomic tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors, we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to few clonal subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates. By comparing multiple subpopulations from different anatomic locations we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and the organization of tumor growth.</docText>

        <docText>The Clusterin paradigm in prostate and breast carcinogenesis.

The biological functions of Clusterin (CLU, also known as ApoJ, SGP2, TRPM2, CLI) have been puzzling researchers since its first discovery in the early 80's. We know that CLU is a single 9-exons gene expressing three protein forms with different sub-cellular localizations and diverse biological functions . Despite the many reports from many research teams on CLU action and its relation to tumourigenesis, contradictions in the data and alternative hypothesis still exist. Understanding the role of CLU in tumourigenesis is complicated not only by the existence of different protein forms but also by the changes of tumors over time and the selection pressures imposed by treatments such as hormone ablation or chemotherapy. This review focuses on recent discoveries concerning the role of CLU in prostate and breast cancer onset and progression. Although CLU acts primarily as a tumor-suppressor in the early stages of carcinogenesis, consistent with its role in the involution of the prostate following castration, late stage cancer may over-express CLU following chemotherapeutic drugs or hormonal ablation therapy. High expression of secreted or cytoplasmic CLU may represent a pro-survival stimulus because it confers increased resistance to killing by anti-cancer drugs or enhances tumour cell survival in specific niches.</docText>

        <docText>Plasma sex hormone concentrations and breast cancer risk in an ethnically diverse population of postmenopausal women: the Multiethnic Cohort Study.

To add to the existing evidence that comes mostly from White populations, we conducted a nested case-control study to examine the association between sex hormones and breast cancer risk within the Multiethnic Cohort that includes Japanese American, White, Native Hawaiian, African American, and Latina women. Of the postmenopausal women for whom we had a plasma sample, 132 developed breast cancer during follow-up. Two controls per case, matched on study area (Hawaii, Los Angeles), ethnicity/race, birth year, date and time of blood draw and time fasting, were randomly selected from the women who had not developed breast cancer. Levels of estradiol, estrone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone were quantified by radioimmunoassay after organic extraction and Celite column partition chromatography. Estrone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were quantified by direct immunoassays. Based on conditional logistic regression, the sex hormones were positively associated and SHBG was negatively associated with breast cancer risk. All associations, except those with DHEAS and testosterone showed a significant linear trend. The odds ratio associated with a doubling of estradiol levels was 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58-3.25) and the odds ratio associated with a doubling of testosterone levels was 1.34 (95% CI 0.98-1.82). The associations in Japanese American women, who constituted 54% of our sample, were similar to or nonsignificantly stronger than in the overall group. This study provides the best evidence to date that the association between sex hormones and breast cancer risk is generalizable to an ethnically diverse population.</docText>

        <docText>Drug-induced pruritic micropapular eruption: anastrozole, a commonly used aromatase inhibitor.

Anastrozole, a selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor is widely used as an adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with early hormone-sensitive breast cancer. There are few reports on cutaneous side effects of anastrozole. It may induce subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, erythema nodosum, cutaneous vasculitis, and nondescript skin eruptions. A 68-year-old woman was prescribed anastrozole after surgical removal of her breast cancer and adjuvant radiation therapy. Two months later she experienced a generalized pruritic micropapular eruption. History, clinical presentation, histology and inadvertent re-exposure to the drug confirmed that anastrozole triggered the exanthem. Pruritic micropapular eruption is a typical pattern for a drug hypersensitivity reaction. Anastrozole should be added to the list of medications able to induce not only non-specific eruptions but the type of exanthem typically triggered by drugs.</docText>

        <docText>B7-H4 gene polymorphisms are associated with sporadic breast cancer in a Chinese Han population.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: B7-H4, a co-inhibitory molecule of the B7 family, can restrain T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion and the development of cytotoxicity. B7-H4 is expressed in tumor tissues at a higher level than in normal tissues, and has a potential effect to protect tumors from anti-tumor immune responses. This case-control study was carried out to determine the potential influences of B7-H4 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility and progression of breast cancer in Han women of Northeast China. METHODS: We genotyped three B7-H4 variants (rs10754339, rs10801935 and rs3738414) and tagged all common haplotypes (frequency greater than or equal to 1%) in a Chinese population consisting of 500 breast cancer cases and 504 control individuals matched for age. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used to determine the genotypes. RESULTS: Our data indicated that, compared with the common genotype and allele of each SNP, the rs10754339 AG genotype and G allele showed a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.455, 95% CI 1.119-1.892; OR = 1.325, 95% CI 1.073-1.637, respectively). The rs10801935 CC genotype, the rs3738414 AA genotype and the rs3738414 A allele were associated with a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.328, 95% CI 0.145-0.739; OR = 0.412, 95% CI 0.203-0.835; OR = 0.698, 95% CI 0.564-0.864, respectively). Additionally, the rs10754339 GG genotype was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and PR status, and the G allele and the AG genotype were respectively associated with lymph node metastasis and ER status. In haplotype analysis, we observed that compared with the AAG haplotype, the AAA haplotype showed a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.689, 95% CI 0.539-0.881), but the GAG haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.511, 95% CI 1.125-2.031). And the AAA and the GCG haplotypes also respectively have significant influences on tumor size and ER status. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that B7-H4 gene polymorphism may contribute to the sporadic breast cancer risk and prognosis in Chinese Han women.</docText>

        <docText>Altered serotonin physiology in human breast cancers favors paradoxical growth and cell survival.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The breast microenvironment can either retard or accelerate the events associated with progression of latent cancers. However, the actions of local physiological mediators in the context of breast cancers are poorly understood. Serotonin (5-HT) is a critical local regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the breast and other organs. Herein, we report complex alterations in the intrinsic mammary gland serotonin system of human breast cancers. METHODS: Serotonin biosynthetic capacity was analyzed in human breast tumor tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry for tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1). Serotonin receptors (5-HT1-7) were analyzed in human breast tumors using the Oncomine database. Serotonin receptor expression, signal transduction, and 5-HT effects on breast cancer cell phenotype were compared in non-transformed and transformed human breast cells. RESULTS: In the context of the normal mammary gland, 5-HT acts as a physiological regulator of lactation and involution, in part by favoring growth arrest and cell death. This tightly regulated 5-HT system is subverted in multiple ways in human breast cancers. Specifically, TPH1 expression undergoes a non-linear change during progression, with increased expression during malignant progression. Correspondingly, the tightly regulated pattern of 5-HT receptors becomes dysregulated in human breast cancer cells, resulting in both ectopic expression of some isoforms and suppression of others. The receptor expression change is accompanied by altered downstream signaling of 5-HT receptors in human breast cancer cells, resulting in resistance to 5-HT-induced apoptosis, and stimulated proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data constitutes the first report of direct involvement of 5-HT in human breast cancer. Increased 5-HT biosynthetic capacity accompanied by multiple changes in 5-HT receptor expression and signaling favor malignant progression of human breast cancer cells (e.g., stimulated proliferation, inappropriate cell survival). This occurs through uncoupling of serotonin from the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms of the normal mammary epithelium. The findings open a new avenue for identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and valuable new therapeutic targets for managing breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Assessing the usefulness of a novel MRI-based breast density estimation algorithm in a cohort of women at high genetic risk of breast cancer: the UK MARIBS study.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Mammographic breast density is one of the strongest known risk factors for breast cancer. We present a novel technique for estimating breast density based on 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluate its performance, including for breast cancer risk prediction, relative to two standard mammographic density-estimation methods. METHODS: The analyses were based on MRI (n = 655) and mammography (n = 607) images obtained in the course of the UK multicentre magnetic resonance imaging breast screening (MARIBS) breast-screening study of asymptomatic women aged 31 - 49 years who were at high genetic risk of breast cancer. The MRI percent and absolute dense volumes were estimated using our novel algorithm (MRIBview) while mammographic percent and absolute dense area were estimated using the Cumulus thresholding algorithm and also using a 21-point visual assessment scale for one medio-lateral oblique image per woman. We assessed the relationships of the MRI and mammographic measures to one another, to standard anthropometric and hormonal factors, to BRCA1/2 genetic status, and to breast cancer risk (60 cases) using linear and Poisson regression. RESULTS: MRI percent dense volume is well correlated with mammographic percent dense area (R = 0.76) but overall gives estimates 8.1 percentage points lower (P &lt;0.0001). Both show strong associations with established anthropometric and hormonal factors. Mammographic percent dense area, and to a lesser extent MRI percent dense volume were lower in BRCA1 carriers (P = 0.001, P = 0.010 respectively) but there was no association with BRCA2 carrier status. The study was underpowered to detect expected associations between percent density and breast cancer, but women with absolute MRI dense volume in the upper half of the distribution had double the risk of those in the lower half (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The MRIBview estimates of volumetric breast density are highly correlated with mammographic dense area but are not equivalent measures; the MRI absolute dense volume shows potential as a predictor of breast cancer risk that merits further investigation.</docText>

        <docText>Targeting phospholipase D with small-molecule inhibitors as a potential therapeutic approach for cancer metastasis.

Phospholipase D (PLD)1 and PLD2, the classic mammalian members of the PLD superfamily, have been linked over the past three decades to immune cell function and to cell biological processes required by cancer cells for metastasis. However, owing to the lack of effective small-molecule inhibitors, it has not been possible to validate these roles for the PLDs and to explore the possible utility of acute and chronic PLD inhibition in vivo. The first such inhibitors have recently been described and demonstrated to block neutrophil chemotaxis and invasion by breast cancer cells in culture, increasing the prospects for a new class of therapeutics for autoimmune disorders and several types of metastatic cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Fetal cell microchimerism in cancer: a meaningful event?

The influence of pregnancy on the occurrence and evolution of maternal tumors has been long debated. Breast carcinomas or melanomas have been suspected to be more severe during gestation. Recently, many investigators have described the transfer and persistence of fetal cells in maternal circulation and tissues during and after pregnancy. These fetal microchimeric cells have been described in a variety of maternal injured tissues where they displayed the host-tissue phenotype. Given the wide variety of injury and tissue types described, cancer has appeared as a potential situation that could be influenced by fetal microchimeric cells. This new unexplored effect of gestation on tumor course has been hypothesized as either protective against cancer, via the activity of allogenic fetal cells, or as promoting cancer, via a supportive role of fetal microchimeric cells in the tumor stroma. In this review, we will detail recent data supporting these hypotheses.</docText>

        <docText>Challenges in defining predictive markers for response to endocrine therapy in breast cancer.

Endocrine therapy is a major treatment modality for hormone-dependent breast cancer. It has a relatively low morbidity, and there is evidence that antihormonal treatments have had a significant effect in reducing mortality for breast cancer. Despite this, resistance to endocrine therapy, either primary or acquired during treatment, occurs in the majority of patients, and is a major obstacle to optimal clinical management. There is therefore an urgent need to identify, on an individual basis, those tumors that are most likely to respond to endocrine therapy (so sparing patients with resistant tumors the needless side effects of ineffective therapy), and the mechanisms of resistance in tumors that are nonresponsive to treatment (so these can be bypassed). These needs are the focus of this review, which discusses the particular issues encountered when investigating the potential of multigene expression signatures as predictive factors for response to aromatase inhibitors, which have recently become front-line endocrine therapies for postmenopausal patients with breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Polymorphism of human cytochrome P450 2D6 and its clinical significance: part II.</docTitle>
        <docText>Polymorphism of human cytochrome P450 2D6 and its clinical significance: part II.

Part I of this article discussed the potential functional importance of genetic mutations and alleles of the human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene. The impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the clearance of and response to a series of cardiovascular drugs was addressed. Since CYP2D6 plays a major role in the metabolism of a large number of other drugs, Part II of the article highlights the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the response to other groups of clinically used drugs. Although clinical studies have observed a gene-dose effect for some tricyclic antidepressants, it is difficult to establish clear relationships of their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic parameters to genetic variations of CYP2D6; therefore, dosage adjustment based on the CYP2D6 phenotype cannot be recommended at present. There is initial evidence for a gene-dose effect on commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but data on the effect of the CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype on the response to SSRIs and their adverse effects are scanty. Therefore, recommendations for dose adjustment of prescribed SSRIs based on the CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype may be premature. A number of clinical studies have indicated that there are significant relationships between the CYP2D6 genotype and steady-state concentrations of perphenazine, zuclopenthixol, risperidone and haloperidol. However, findings on the relationships between the CYP2D6 genotype and parkinsonism or tardive dyskinesia treatment with traditional antipsychotics are conflicting, probably because of small sample size, inclusion of antipsychotics with variable CYP2D6 metabolism, and co-medication. CYP2D6 phenotyping and genotyping appear to be useful in predicting steady-state concentrations of some classical antipsychotic drugs, but their usefulness in predicting clinical effects must be explored. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been strongly recommended for many antipsychotics, including haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, risperidone and thioridazine, which are all metabolized by CYP2D6. It is possible to merge therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing for CYP2D6 into clinical practice. There is a clear gene-dose effect on the formation of O-demethylated metabolites from multiple opioids, but the clinical significance of this may be minimal, as the analgesic effect is not altered in poor metabolizers (PMs). Genetically caused inactivity of CYP2D6 renders codeine ineffective owing to lack of morphine formation, decreases the efficacy of tramadol owing to reduced formation of the active O-desmethyl-tramadol and reduces the clearance of methadone. Genetically precipitated drug interactions might render a standard opioid dose toxic. Because of the important role of CYP2D6 in tamoxifen metabolism and activation, PMs are likely to exhibit therapeutic failure, and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) are likely to experience adverse effects and toxicities. There is a clear gene-concentration effect for the formation of endoxifen and 4-OH-tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-treated cancer patients carrying CYP2D6*4, *5, *10, or *41 associated with significantly decreased formation of antiestrogenic metabolites had significantly more recurrences of breast cancer and shorter relapse-free periods. Many studies have identified the genetic CYP2D6 status as an independent predictor of the outcome of tamoxifen treatment in women with breast cancer, but others have not observed this relationship. Thus, more favourable tamoxifen treatment seems to be feasible through a priori genetic assessment of CYP2D6, and proper dose adjustment may be needed when the CYP2D6 genotype is determined in a patient. Dolasetron, ondansetron and tropisetron, all in part metabolized by CYP2D6, are less effective in UMs than in other patients. Overall, there is a strong gene-concentration relationship only for tropisetron. CYP2D6 genotype screening prior to antiemetic treatment may allow for modification of antiemetic dosing. An alternative is to use a serotonin agent that is metabolized independently of CYP2D6, such as granisetron, which would obviate the need for genotyping and may lead to an improved drug response. To date, the functional impact of most CYP2D6 alleles has not been systematically assessed for most clinically important drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, though some initial evidence has been identified for a very limited number of drugs. The majority of reported in vivo pharmacogenetic data on CYP2D6 are from single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic studies of a small number of drugs. Pharmacodynamic data on CYP2D6 polymorphisms are scanty for most drug studies. Given that genotype testing for CYP2D6 is not routinely performed in clinical practice and there is uncertainty regarding genotype-phenotype, gene-concentration and gene-dose relationships, further prospective studies on the clinical impact of CYP2D6-dependent metabolism of drugs are warranted in large cohorts.</docText>

        <docText>Hormonal therapy in metastatic breast cancer

The primary objective in metastatic breast cancer is tumor control and symptom palliation. Factors to be considered are: efficacy, tolerance and quality of life as well as patient preferences. In the Hormone Receptor Positive Group, Hormonal treatment is the best choice because of it's effectiveness and good toxicity profile. Endocrine therapy has two main targets: the first one is to block estrogen production. In premenopausal women this can be through ovarian ablation. In postmenopausal women this is achieved by blocking the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens by blocking the enzyme known as aromatase. The other option is to block the action of the estrogen on it's receptor with the group of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). This class of drugs can be used in pre and postmenopausal women. Treatment should be tailored according to patient characteristics and menopausal status.</docText>

        <docText>Waiting times for access, diagnosis and treatment in a cancer centre.

We analysed the waiting times for patients in a Dublin hospital from 2001 to 2006, and evaluated trends in each of 4 cancer diagnoses; breast, lung, colorectal and upper gastrointestinal (gastric and oesophageal). Measured times were; time from referral to first seen, time from first seen to diagnosis and time from diagnosis to treatment. Patient numbers increased 39% from 529 in 2001 to 737 in 2006. As a result waiting times have increased over the 6 years. While median time from referral to first seen for breast cancer was 7 days, it rose from 2 to 5 days for lung cancer, 1 to 2 days for colorectal cancer, and 1 to 6 days for upper GI cancers. The time from diagnosis to treatment rose from 8 to 15 days (breast), 10 days to 25 (lung), 6 to 14 days (colorectal) and 7 to 13 days (Upper GI). Waiting times however, remain within international standards.</docText>

        <docTitle>Mammographic density and the risk of breast cancer recurrence after breast-conserving surgery.</docTitle>
        <docText>Mammographic density and the risk of breast cancer recurrence after breast-conserving surgery.

BACKGROUND:: Women with invasive breast cancer who are treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy face a cumulative risk of local disease recurrence of approximately 10% at 10 years. To the authors' knowledge, the role of mammographic density as a risk factor for the development of local recurrence has not been thoroughly evaluated to date. METHODS:: Medical records were reviewed for 335 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer and for whom a pretreatment mammogram was available. Information was recorded concerning mammographic density as well as tumor features, patient characteristics, and adjuvant treatments received. Patients were categorized for mammographic density based on the Wolfe classification as either low (&lt;25% density), intermediate (25-50% density), or high (&gt;50% density). A multivariate survival analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model with local disease recurrence as the primary endpoint. RESULTS:: Patients in the high mammographic density group experienced a much greater risk of local disease recurrence compared with women with the least dense breasts (10-year actuarial risks: 21% vs 5%; hazards ratio [HR], 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.6-20; P = .006]). The difference in the rates of disease recurrence at 10 years was pronounced for women who did not receive radiotherapy (40% vs 0% for patients with &gt;50% density and &lt;25% density, respectively; P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS:: Mammographic breast density is an important risk factor for local breast cancer recurrence among women not receiving breast irradiation. Mammographic density should be taken into consideration when stratifying patients for clinical trials of partial breast radiotherapy. If confirmed, mammographic density might be used to help determine which patients might benefit from radiotherapy. Cancer 2009. (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.</docText>

        <docText>Expression of the Lipid Transporters ABCA3 and ABCA1 is Diminished in Human Breast Cancer Tissue.

ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA3 and ABCA1 are related to a differentiated, lipid-secreting phenotype of type II pneumocytes. Since mammary gland epithelial cells also show pronounced lipid metabolism and secretion, we investigated the expression of these proteins in normal as well as in neoplastic breast tissue. Normal human breast tissue, breast cancer cell lines, and 162 tumor samples of patients with primary unilateral invasive breast cancer were analyzed for ABCA3 and ABCA1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. Strong ABCA3 and ABCA1 expression was found in the inner layer of normal mammary gland epithelium. Concurrent cytoplasmic ABCA3 and ABCA1 immunoreactivity was found in 9 of 11 breast cancer cell lines. ABCA3 and ABCA1 were shown to be differentially expressed in human breast cancer. Loss of ABCA3 staining was significantly associated with positive nodal status and negative progesterone receptor expression. In multivariate analysis, diminished ABCA3 expression proved to be a significant, independent and adverse risk factor for tumor recurrence. ABCA1 expression was associated with positive lymph nodes, but not significantly associated with tumor recurrence or breast cancer-specific survival. ABCA3 and ABCA1 are strongly expressed in normal mammary gland epithelium. Decreased ABCA3 expression in breast cancer seems to be associated with poor prognosis.</docText>

        <docText>Breast-feeding the last born child and risk of ovarian cancer.

Conflicting reports regarding the relationship between breast-feeding and ovarian cancer risk suggest a possible influence of patterns of breast-feeding. We used logistic regression to examine breast-feeding in a large population of parous women who participated in a case-control study of ovarian cancer in New Hampshire and MA, USA. Risk of ovarian cancer was reduced in parous women who ever breast-fed (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.92), but evidence was limited for an influence of duration of breast-feeding and the number of children breast-fed. Compared to never breast-feeding, inverse associations were seen for breast-feeding all children (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.91) and for breast-feeding some children when the last born child was breast-fed (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.91). There was little evidence of reduced risk for those who breast-fed some children when the last born child was not breast-fed (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.26). Similar findings were noted in women with exactly two children and in those with two or more children. The protective influence of breast-feeding on ovarian cancer risk may be limited to women who breast-feed their last born child. These findings, which require confirmation by future studies, imply that breast-feeding resets pregnancy-related states that mediate ovarian cancer risk.</docText>

        <docText>Health-related behavior change after cancer: results of the American Cancer Society's studies of cancer survivors (SCS).

INTRODUCTION: Cancer survivors are known to make positive health-related behavior changes after cancer, but less is known about negative behavior changes and correlates of behavior change. The present study was undertaken to examine positive and negative behavior changes after cancer and to identify medical, demographic, and psychosocial correlates of changes. METHODS: We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey of 7,903 cancer survivors at 3, 6, and 11 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 15 behaviors assessed, survivors reported 4 positive and 1 or 0 negative behavior changes. Positive change correlated with younger age, greater education, breast cancer, longer time since diagnosis, comorbidities, vitality, fear of recurrence, and spiritual well-being, while negative change correlated with younger age, being non-Hispanic African American, being widowed, divorced or separated, and lower physical and emotional health. Faith mediated the relationship between race/ethnicity and positive change. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors were more likely to make positive than negative behavior changes after cancer. Demographic, medical, and psychosocial variables were associated with both types of changes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Results provide direction for behavior interventions and illustrate the importance of looking beyond medical and demographic variables to understand the motivators and barriers to positive behavior change after cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Gli1 promotes cell survival and is predictive of a poor outcome in ERalpha-negative breast cancer.

Gli1 is a transcription factor and oncogene with documented roles in the progression of several cancer types, including cancers of the skin and pancreas. The contribution of Gli1 to the progression of breast cancer is less established. In order to investigate the functional impact of Gli1 in breast cancer, expression of Gli1 and its contribution to cell growth was assessed in breast cancer cell lines. These in vitro results were compared to expression of Gli1, determined by immunohistochemistry, in 171 breast cancers. In these cancers, the association of Gli1 with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and progesterone receptor (PR), ErbB2, p53, the rate of proliferation, and clinicopathologic parameters and outcome was assessed. Expression of Gli1 and ERalpha mRNA was strongly correlated in ERalpha-positive cell lines (r = 0.999). Treatment with estrogen increased expression of Gli1 in 2 of 3 ERalpha-positive cell lines; this increase was prevented by treatment with the ERalpha-specific antagonist MPP. Silencing of Gli1 by shRNA markedly reduced the survival of two ERalpha-negative cell lines, but caused only a modest reduction in ERalpha-positive cell lines. In breast cancer tissues, cancers with nuclear localization of Gli1 had a higher ERalpha (P=0.027) and lower p53 expression (P=0.017) than those without nuclear localization of Gli1. However, nuclear localization of Gli1 was predictive of a poorer cancer-specific survival in ERalpha-negative, including triple negative, cancers (P = 0.005), but not ERalpha-positive cancers. In conclusion, we demonstrate a positive association between expression of Gli1 and ERalpha; however, our data indicate a greater functional effect of Gli1 in ERalpha-negative cancers.</docText>

        <docText>A unique proteolytic fragment of alpha1-antitrypsin is elevated in ductal fluid of breast cancer patient.

By comparison of mass spectra from a small cohort of nipple aspiration fluids (NAF), we previously discovered a panel of five candidate breast cancer biomarkers among them an unidentified 4.7 kD peptide BF5. The purposes of the present study were to verify the presence of BF5 in an independent cohort; to determine the protein identity of BF5; and to provide insight into the biology of BF5 production and elevation in tumor-associated NAF. We prospectively collected bilaterally matched NAF from patients with unilateral Stage I/II breast cancer (IBC-31), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS-6), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH-5), and presumed healthy women who came to routine mammography and had a normal exam (31). Following the consolidation of its cancer-associated expression on SELDI-mass spectrometry, BF5 was isolated by gel electrophoresis and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. BF5 was elevated in 15-25% of women with IBC, DCIS, or ADH vs. 0% of controls. This elevation was restricted to the affected breasts. BF5 was identified as 41/42-aa C-terminal peptide of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT), the principle inhibitor of serine protease neutrophile elastase. The full length AAT showed a consistent expression pattern as C-41/42, and C-41/42 can be generated in vitro by MMP-7 cleavage. In conclusion, elevated C-41/42 is likely the result of elevated AAT synthesis, and the activity of specific MMPs present within the tumor. As other C-terminal fragments of AAT are reported to function as tumor-derived suppressors to the host immune-system, elevated C-41/42 may also be predictive of a poor outcome.</docText>

        <docText>GPR30 and estrogen receptor expression: new insights into hormone dependence of inflammatory breast cancer.

GPR30 is a novel G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (ER) associated with metastases in breast cancer (BC) and poor survival in endometrial and ovarian tumors. The association of GPR30 expression with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), an aggressive and commonly hormone-independent form of BC, has not been studied. GPR30, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and HER-2 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry (and FISH for HER-2) in 88 primary IBCs. GPR30 expression was correlated with patient overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), pathologic variables, and other biomarkers. GPR30 expression was found in 69% of IBC cases. ER, PR, HER-2, and EGFR were found in 43, 35, 39, and 34% of IBC cases, respectively. GPR30 expression correlated inversely with ER expression (P = 0.02). Co-expression of ER and GPR30 was found in 24% of IBC samples; 19% expressed only ER and 46% expressed only GPR30. Univariate analysis showed no association between GPR30 expression and OS or DFS. However, co-expression of ER and GPR30 was associated with improved OS (P &lt; 0.03) and marginally with DFS (P &lt; 0.06); the absence of both ER and GPR30 was associated with worse OS and DFS (P = 0.03 for both). Multivariate analysis identified ER as an independent prognostic factor of OS (P = 0.008) and DFS (P = 0.02). The majority of IBC tumors are GPR30-positive, suggesting that estrogen signaling may be active in ER-negative IBC patients. These findings suggest potential new therapeutic targets for IBC such as novel endocrine agents or direct modulation of GPR30.</docText>

        <docText>Women's Perceptions of the Personal and Family Impact of Genetic Cancer Risk Assessment: Focus Group Findings.

Women with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer are increasingly presenting for genetic cancer risk assessment (GCRA). To explore the personal and family impact of GCRA, four focus groups were conducted of women seen for risk assessment. Participants were 22 primarily non-Latina White women with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Analysis of the data identified new themes related to balancing time to assimilate risk information with the need to make timely healthcare decisions, physicians' lack of sufficient genetic knowledge, and concern for daughters regardless of the daughters' age. Other themes related to protecting others, knowledge as empowerment, reassessing personal attribution of cancer risk, managing uncertainty, reappraising body image, and experiencing divergent family responses to communication of cancer risk and healthcare decisions. Understanding the personal and family impact of GCRA may enable genetics professionals to tailor their counseling efforts to better meet the needs of these women. Additional research is needed to extend these findings and identify interventions to support positive outcomes of GCRA.</docText>

        <docText>Factors Related to Return to Work by Women with Breast Cancer in Northern France.

Introduction Earlier diagnosis and better treatment have increased the survival rates of breast cancer patients. This warrants research on return to work of cancer survivors, especially about subjective factors because they affect the mental desire to return to work. Moreover, knowledge in this issue is very limited in France. Objectives This study aims to explore the objective and subjective factors that affect whether and when women with breast cancer return to work. Methods 379 women with breast cancer aged 18-60 years who were working at the time of diagnosis responded to a 45 item questionnaire. The questionnaire had personal characteristics, disease-related characteristics and work-related ones. Multivariate logistic regressions were run to determine the association of these factors and return to work and time until return to work. Results During a median follow-up of 36 months, 82.1% of the 379 women who had worked before their diagnosis returned to work after a median sick leave of 10.8 months. Older age, lower educational level, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, lymphoedema, psychological or organizational self-perceived constraints related to their former job, and the lack of moral support from work colleagues both limited and delayed return to work. Conclusion The resumption of work by women with breast cancer depends on many factors, not all of them medical. The self-perceived factors must be considered: first to help support these women during their sick leave, while taking into account elements that may hinder early return to work; second to initiate a work resumption support process which takes into account both the person and her environment.</docText>

        <docText>Basal levels of DNA damage detected by micronuclei and comet assays in untreated breast cancer patients and healthy women.

Breast cancer is the second most frequent type of cancer worldwide and is the most common malignant disease among women. Risk factors for breast cancer include early menarche, late menopause, hormonal therapies, exposure to environmental pollutants, smoking and alcohol use. However, increased or prolonged exposure to estrogen is the most important risk factor. It has been suggested that accumulation of DNA damage may contribute to breast carcinogenesis. Epidemiological studies suggest that cytogenetic biomarkers such as micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes may predict cancer risk because they indicate genomic instability in target tissues. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the frequencies of micronuclei and the extent of DNA damage detected by comet assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes of untreated breast cancer patients and healthy women. The study was conducted using peripheral blood lymphocytes from 45 women diagnosed for Ductal "in situ" or invasive breast carcinoma and 85 healthy control women. Micronuclei and comet assays were performed to detect spontaneous DNA damage. The results showed that micronuclei frequencies and tail intensity, detected by comet assay, were significantly higher in the breast cancer group than in controls. The levels of DNA damage were similar in smokers and non-smokers, and aging did not influence the frequencies of micronuclei or tail intensity values observed in either group. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates higher levels of DNA damage in untreated breast cancer patients than in healthy women.</docText>

        <docTitle>Transformed epithelial cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts interaction in breast tumor: a mathematical model and experiments.</docTitle>
        <docText>Transformed epithelial cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts interaction in breast tumor: a mathematical model and experiments.

It is well known that tumor and its microenvironment, or stroma, interact with each other and that this interaction plays a critical role in tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. This interaction consists of complex relations between tumor cells, stromal cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells and immunocytes, the vascular system, the extracellular matrix, and cytokines secreted by the cells. Understanding these relationships may lead to new therapeutic approaches to cancer. In the present paper, we consider tumor-stroma crosstalk in a simple in vitro situation which involves interaction between tumor epithelial cells from breast cancer and a microenvironment consisting of just fibroblasts. The two populations of cells are separated by a semi-permeable membrane that allows only cytokines to cross over. We develop a mathematical model that includes two critical growth factors: TGF-beta, produced by the tumor cells, and EGF, secreted by the fibroblasts. The TGF-beta modifies the microenvironment by transforming fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts secrete higher concentrations of EGF than fibroblasts, thereby, increasing the proliferation of tumor cells. Thus already in this simple setup one sees a mutual interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment. We conducted experiments which show good agreement with the model's simulations, hence confirming the model's ability to predict aspects of tumor cell behavior in response to signaling from fibroblasts.</docText>

        <docText>Studying the Association of Polymorphic Variants of GSTM1 and GSTT1 Genes with Breast Cancer in Female Residents of Altai Krai.

The incidence of homozygote deletion of glutathione S-transferase genes M1 and T1 (null genotypes; or GSTM1"-" and GSTT1"-") was studied in breast cancer patients living in Altai Krai. DNA was isolated from blood samples of 695 breast cancer patients (291 patients with familial cancer and 404 patients with sporadic cancer) and 263 women without history of tumor diseases. The frequency of GSTM1"-" and GSTT1"-" genotypes was estimated in breast cancer patients (47.2 and 19.1%, respectively) and non-cancer participants (46.8 and 19.0%, respectively). No differences were found in the frequency of genotypes. The frequency of genotype combination GSTM1"-"+GSTT1"-" in patients with sporadic breast cancer (11.6%, 47 of 404 patients) was higher than in the control (6.1%, 16 of 263 patients; OR=2.03; 95% CI=2.09-3.83; p=0.02). The genotype frequency of genes in the control group did not differ from that in European residents of the Caucasian race.</docText>

        <docText>Dietary intake and serum levels of iron in relation to oxidative stress in breast cancer patients.

Iron may induce oxidative stress via production of reactive oxygen species, facilitating mammary carcinogenesis. This study investigated the role of iron in relation to oxidative stress as a potential risk factor in the development of breast cancer (BC). BC patients (n = 121) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 149) were entered into the study. Iron and antioxidant vitamins intakes were estimated using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Thirty one subjects from each group provided blood samples for measurement of serum iron, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP). Total and non-heme iron intake of BC patients were lower than those of the controls. However, the serum iron level was significantly higher in BC patients. Plasma MDA levels were also significantly higher in BC patients whereas no significant difference in FRAP values were observed between the two groups. Log-transformed serum iron concentration showed no significant correlation with MDA or FRAP. These results suggest that serum iron overload may be a breast cancer risk factor possibly due to increased oxidative stress.</docText>

        <docText>Extracellular cleavage and shedding of P-cadherin: a mechanism underlying the invasive behaviour of breast cancer cells.

Cell-cell adhesion is an elementary process in normal epithelial cellular architecture. Several studies have shown the role mediated by cadherins in this process, besides their role in the maintenance of cell polarity, differentiation and cell growth. However, during tumour progression, these molecules are frequently altered. In breast cancer, tumours that overexpress P-cadherin usually present a high histological grade, show decreased cell polarity and are associated with worse patient survival. However, little is known about how this protein dictates the very aggressive behaviour of these tumours. To achieve this goal, we set up two breast cancer cell models, where P-cadherin expression was differently modulated and analysed in terms of cell invasion, motility and migration. We show that P-cadherin overexpression, in breast cancer cells with wild-type E-cadherin, promotes cell invasion, motility and migration. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of P-cadherin induces the secretion of matrix metalloproteases, specifically MMP-1 and MMP-2, which then lead to P-cadherin ectodomain cleavage. Further, we showed that soluble P-cadherin fragment is able to induce in vitro invasion of breast cancer cells. Overall, our results contribute to elucidate the mechanism underlying the invasive behaviour of P-cadherin expressing breast tumours.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.338.</docText>

        <docTitle>Anthrax toxin receptor 2 is expressed in murine and tumor vasculature and functions in endothelial proliferation and morphogenesis.</docTitle>
        <docText>Anthrax toxin receptor 2 is expressed in murine and tumor vasculature and functions in endothelial proliferation and morphogenesis.

The Capillary Morphogenesis Gene 2 (CMG2) gene encodes an Anthrax toxin receptor (ANTXR2), but the normal physiological function is not known. ANTXR2/CMG2 was originally identified as a result of up-regulation during capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells (ECs) cultured in vitro. We explored the hypothesis that key steps of the angiogenic process are either dependent or are influenced by ANTXR2/CMG2 activity. We describe the expression pattern of ANTXR2/CMG2 in several murine tissues and in normal breast and breast tumors. Endothelial expression was found in all of the tissues analyzed, in cultured ECs and in breast tumor vessels; however, ANTXR2/CMG2 expression was not restricted to this cell type. To assess potential angiogenic function, we used RNA interference to achieve significant reduction of ANTXR2/CMG2 expression in cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). Reduced ANTXR2/CMG2 expression resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation and reduced capacity of ECs to form capillary-like networks in vitro, whereas overexpression of ANTXR2/CMG2 in HUVEC increased proliferation and capillary-like network formation. Little change in migration of ECs was observed on knockdown or overexpression. We conclude that ANTXR2/CMG2 functions to promote endothelial proliferation and morphogenesis during sprouting angiogenesis, consistent with the endothelial expression of ANTXR2/CMG2 in several vascular beds.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.383.</docText>

        <docText>Genetic Polymorphisms in the Polycomb Group Gene EZH2 and the Risk of Lung Cancer.

INTRODUCTION:: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play essential roles in cellular memory systems and as cell cycle regulators by maintaining homeotic genes in their silenced states. EZH1 and EZH2, the human homologues of the Drosophila gene Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), are defined as PcG proteins and contain a highly conserved motif, called the SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax) domain, which is required for histone methyltransferase activity. Increased expression of the transcriptional repressor EZH2 has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in various malignancies including breast cancer and prostate cancer. Altered expression of EZH2 was also demonstrated in lung cancer, suggesting an involvement in the progression of lung cancer. METHODS:: All 41 polymorphisms in EZH2 were genotyped in 335 patients with lung cancer and 335 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Finally, 26 polymorphisms were selected for the statistical analysis based on minor allele frequency (&gt;0.05) and linkage disequilibrium. RESULTS:: Two polymorphisms of EZH2, rs6950683 and rs3757441, showed a statistically significant association with reduced risk of lung cancer (adjusted OR [aOR] = 0.71, p = 0.007; aOR = 0.73, p = 0.015, respectively). Two copies of a haplotype (Ht2) of EZH2 also showed a significant association with reduced lung cancer risk (aOR = 0.45, 95% confidence interval = 0.23-0.87). CONCLUSION:: This is the first study to show a significant association between polymorphisms of the PcG gene EZH2 and lung cancer risk. This study suggests a correlation between the genotype variants in EZH2 and reduced lung cancer risk and hence presents a possible marker for lung cancer susceptibility.</docText>

        <docText>Cross-cultural adaptation of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire: Spanish for Puerto Rico version.

The purpose of this study was to perform a cross-cultural adaptation of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire to Spanish for Puerto Rico. Five steps were followed for the cross-cultural adaptation: forward translations into Spanish for Puerto Rico, synthesis of the translations, back translations into English, revision by an expert committee, and field test of the prefinal version. Psychometric characteristics of reliability and construct validity were evaluated for the final version. Internal consistency of the final version was high (Cronbach's alpha=0.97) and item-to-total correlations were moderate (range from 0.44 to 0.85). Construct validity was evaluated by correlating the DASH with the scales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast. Fair to moderate correlations found in this study between the DASH and most scales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast support the construct validity of the Puerto Rico-Spanish DASH. The final version of the questionnaire was revised and approved by the Institute for Work and Health of Canada. Revisions to the original DASH English version are recommended. This version of the DASH is valid and reliable, and it can be used to evaluate outcomes in both clinical and research settings.</docText>

        <docText>Phase I dose escalation trial of docetaxel plus curcumin in patients with advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

Background: Since the improvement of chemotherapy with safe molecules is needed for a better efficacy without supplementary toxicity, we investigated the feasibility and tolerability of the combination of docetaxel and curcumin, a polyphenolic derivative extracted from Curcuma longa root. Results: Fourteen patients were accrued in this open-label phase I trial. At the last dose level of curcumin, 3 dose-limiting toxicities were observed and 2 out of 3 patients at this dose level refused to continue treatment, leading us to define the maximal tolerated dose of curcumin at 8,000 mg/d. Eight patients out of 14 had measurable lesions according to RECIST criteria, with 5 PR and 3 SD. Some improvements as biological and clinical responses were observed in most patients. Patients and methods: Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer were eligible. Docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) was administered as a 1-hour i.v. infusion every 3 weeks on d1 for 6 cycles. Curcumin was orally given from 500 mg/d for 7 consecutive days by cycle (from d-4 to d+2) and escalated until a dose-limiting toxicity should occur. The primary endpoint of this study was to determine the maximal tolerated dose of the combination of dose-escalating curcumin and standard dose of docetaxel chemotherapy in advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients. Secondary objectives included toxicity, safety, vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor markers measurements, and assessment of objective and clinical responses to the combination therapy. Conclusion: The recommended dose of curcumin is 6,000 mg/d for 7 consecutive days every 3 weeks in combination with a standard dose of docetaxel. From the encouraging efficacy results, a comparative phase II trial of this regimen plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone is ongoing in advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Women's Cancer Screening According to Body Mass Index in a Cohort of Rural Korean Women.

PURPOSE: This study was done to examine the difference in cancer screening with mammography and Papanicolaou smear according to Body Mass Index (BMI). METHODS: The participants in this study were 5,912 women ages 40 to 69 yr, selected from the Korean Genomic Regional Cohort in Kangwon province. Mammography and Papanicolaou smear were assessed by questionnaire and body weight (kg) and height (m) measured to calculate BMI. RESULTS: The distribution of BMI was as follows: low weight (1.5%), normal weight (31.1%), over weight (24.6%), mildly obese (36.4%) and severely obese (6.3%). After adjusting for age, education and monthly income, compared with normal weight women, overweight women (odds ratio [OR]=1.283, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.089-1.513) and mildly obese women (OR=1.214, 95% CI=1.048-1.406) were less likely to have had mammography. In contrast to mammography, cancer screening with Papanicolaou smear was not significantly different by BMI. CONCLUSION: Obese women in rural areas are less likely to screen for breast cancer by using mammography than non obese women. To ensure regular screening for breast cancer, health care providers need to give scrupulous care to obese women and remove barriers originated from obesity. Also, educational and clinical implications are considered to increase the Papanicolaou smear rate.</docText>

        <docText>Symptom experience and quality of life in breast cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to evaluate symptom experience and quality of life (QOL) and to identify the predictors of QOL among breast cancer survivors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 disease-free breast cancer survivors at two hospitals between December 2007 and July 2008. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-B, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-short Form and The Linear Analogue Self Assessment Scale were used to assess symptom experience and QOL in these patients. Data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation, t-test, ANOVA, and stepwise multiple regression with SPSS/WIN 12.0. RESULTS: The mean score of QOL for breast cancer survivors was 95.81 (+/-18.02). The highest scores among physical and psychological symptoms were sexual interest and anxiety. Year since treatment completion was significantly associated with QOL in sociodemographic variables. Physical and psychological symptoms have a significant negative association with QOL. The results of the regression analyses showed that physical and psychological symptoms were statistically significant in predicting patients' QOL. CONCLUSION: Symptom experience and QOL are essential variables that should be acknowledged when delivering health care to breast cancer survivors. More attention to the reduction and management of psychological distress could improve QOL among breast cancer survivors.</docText>

        <docTitle>Regulation of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Function by Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators.</docTitle>
        <docText>Regulation of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Function by Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen (TAM), have been used extensively for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer and other pathologies associated with aberrant estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. These compounds exhibit cell-selective agonist/antagonist activities as a consequence of their ability to induce different conformational changes in ER, thereby enabling it to recruit functionally distinct transcriptional coregulators. However, the observation that SERMs can also regulate aspects of calcium signaling and apoptosis in an ER-independent manner in some systems suggests that some of the activity of drugs within this class may also arise as a consequence of their ability to interact with targets other than ER. In this study, we demonstrate that 4-hydroxy-TAM (4OHT), an active metabolite of TAM, directly binds to and modulates the transcriptional activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Of specific interest was the observation, that in the absence of ER, 4OHT can induce the expression of AHR target genes involved in estradiol metabolism, cellular proliferation, and metastasis in cellular models of breast cancer. The potential role for AHR in SERM pharmacology was further underscored by the ability of 4OHT to suppress osteoclast differentiation in vitro in part through AHR. Cumulatively, these findings provide evidence that it is necessary to reevaluate the relative roles of ER and AHR in manifesting the pharmacological actions and therapeutic efficacy of TAM and other SERMs.</docText>

        <docText>Diagnostic error in medicine: analysis of 583 physician-reported errors.

BACKGROUND: Missed or delayed diagnoses are a common but understudied area in patient safety research. To better understand the types, causes, and prevention of such errors, we surveyed clinicians to solicit perceived cases of missed and delayed diagnoses. METHODS: A 6-item written survey was administered at 20 grand rounds presentations across the United States and by mail at 2 collaborating institutions. Respondents were asked to report 3 cases of diagnostic errors and to describe their perceived causes, seriousness, and frequency. RESULTS: A total of 669 cases were reported by 310 clinicians from 22 institutions. After cases without diagnostic errors or lacking sufficient details were excluded, 583 remained. Of these, 162 errors (28%) were rated as major, 241 (41%) as moderate, and 180 (31%) as minor or insignificant. The most common missed or delayed diagnoses were pulmonary embolism (26 cases [4.5% of total]), drug reactions or overdose (26 cases [4.5%]), lung cancer (23 cases [3.9%]), colorectal cancer (19 cases [3.3%]), acute coronary syndrome (18 cases [3.1%]), breast cancer (18 cases [3.1%]), and stroke (15 cases [2.6%]). Errors occurred most frequently in the testing phase (failure to order, report, and follow-up laboratory results) (44%), followed by clinician assessment errors (failure to consider and overweighing competing diagnosis) (32%), history taking (10%), physical examination (10%), and referral or consultation errors and delays (3%). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians readily recalled multiple cases of diagnostic errors and were willing to share their experiences. Using a new taxonomy tool and aggregating cases by diagnosis and error type revealed patterns of diagnostic failures that suggested areas for improvement. Systematic solicitation and analysis of such errors can identify potential preventive strategies.</docText>

        <docText>Y-Box-Binding Protein YB-1 Identifies High-Risk Patients With Primary Breast Cancer Benefiting From Rapidly Cycled Tandem High-Dose Adjuvant Chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of Y-box-binding protein YB-1, a multifunctional protein linked to tumor aggressiveness and multidrug resistance, to identify patients with breast cancer likely to benefit from dose-intensified chemotherapy regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: YB-1 was immunohistochemically determined in 211 primary tumors from the prospective, randomized West German Study Group WSG-AM-01 trial in high-risk (&gt;/= 10 involved lymph-nodes) breast cancer (HRBC). Predictive impact of YB-1 was assessed by multivariate survival analysis, including time-varying factor-therapy interactions. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 61.7 months, patients receiving rapidly cycled tandem high-dose therapy (HD; two cycles [2x] epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 14 days, followed by 2x epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 3,000 mg/m(2), and thiotepa 400 mg/m(2) every 21 days) had better disease-free survival (DFS; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.89) and overall survival (OS; HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.89) than those receiving conventional dose-dense chemotherapy (DD; 4x epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), followed by 3x cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), methotrexate 40 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2) every 14 days). High YB-1 was associated with aggressive tumor phenotype (negative steroid hormone receptor status, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and p53 status, high MIB-1, unfavorable tumor grade) and poor OS (median 78 v 97 months; P = .01). In patients with high YB-1, HD yielded a 63-month median DFS (P = .001) and a 46-month median OS advantage (P = .002) versus DD. In multivariate models, patients with high B-1 receiving HD (v DD) had one third the hazard rate after 20 months for DFS and one sixth after 40 months for OS. CONCLUSION: In a randomized prospective cancer therapy trial, for the first time, a strong predictive impact of YB-1 on survival has been demonstrated: enhanced benefit from HD (v DD) therapy occurs in HRBC with high YB-1. Future trials could therefore address optimal chemotherapeutic strategies,taking YB-1 into account.</docText>

        <docTitle>Dose-Dense Adjuvant Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Is Not Associated With Frequent Short-Term Changes in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.</docTitle>
        <docText>Dose-Dense Adjuvant Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Is Not Associated With Frequent Short-Term Changes in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.

PURPOSE: Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) every 3 weeks has been associated with frequent asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Dose-dense (dd) AC followed by paclitaxel (P) is superior to the same regimen given every third week. Herein, we report the early cardiac safety of three sequential studies of ddAC alone or with bevacizumab (B). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were treated on two trials: ddAC followed by P and trastuzumab (T) and ddAC followed by PT and lapatinib. Patients with HER2-normal breast cancer were treated with B and ddAC followed by B and nanoparticle albumin-bound P. Prospective LVEF measurement by multigated radionuclide angiography scan before and after every 2 week AC for 4 cycles and at month 6 from all three trials were aggregated to determine the early risks of cardiac dysfunction. RESULTS: From January 2005 to May 2008, 245 patients were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (range, 27 to 75 years). Median LVEF pre-ddAC was 68% (range, 52% to 82%). LVEF post-ddAC was available in 241 patients (98%) and the median was unchanged at 68% (range, 47% to 81%). Per protocol no patients were ineligible for subsequent targeted biologic therapy based on LVEF decline post-ddAC. In addition, LVEF was available in 222 patients (92%) at 6 months, at which time the median LVEF was similar at 65% (range, 24% to 80%). Within 6 months of initiating chemotherapy, three patients (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.25% to 3.54%) developed CHF, all of whom received T. CONCLUSION: Dose-dense AC with or without concurrent bevacizumab is not associated with frequent acute or short-term declines in LVEF.</docText>

        <docTitle>Conjugated Equine Estrogen Influence on Mammographic Density in Postmenopausal Women in a Substudy of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Trial.</docTitle>
        <docText>Conjugated Equine Estrogen Influence on Mammographic Density in Postmenopausal Women in a Substudy of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Trial.

PURPOSE: Increased mammographic density is associated with increased breast cancer risk and reduced sensitivity of screening mammography and is related to hormone exposure. However, the effects of conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) alone on mammographic density in diverse racial/ethnic populations are not established. We examined the effect of CEE alone on mammographic density in a subsample of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial participants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the WHI trial, women were randomly assigned to daily CEE 0.625 mg or placebo. The effect of CEE on mammographic percent density was determined over 1 and 2 years in a stratified random sample of 435 racially and ethnically diverse participants from 15 of 40 WHI clinics. RESULTS: Use of CEE resulted in mean increase in mammographic percent density of 1.6 percentage points (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.4) at year 1 compared with a mean decrease of 1.0 percentage point (95% CI, -1.7 to -0.4) in the placebo group (P &lt; .001). The effect persisted for 2 years, with a mean increase of 1.7 percentage points (95% CI, 0.7 to 2.7) versus a mean decrease of 1.2 percentage points (95% CI, -1.8 to -0.5; P &lt; .001) in the hormone and placebo groups, respectively. These effects were greater in women age 60 to 79 years (P = .03 for interaction across age). CONCLUSION: Use of CEE results in a modest but statistically significant increase in mammographic density that is sustained over at least a 2-year period. The clinical significance of the CEE effect on mammographic density remains to be determined.</docText>

        <docText>Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin, and Fluorouracil Versus Dose-Dense Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Paclitaxel Versus Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Paclitaxel in Node-Positive or High-Risk Node-Negative Breast Cancer.

PURPOSE: Cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF) and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel (T) are commonly used adjuvant regimens in women with early breast cancer. In a previous trial in women with locally advanced breast cancer, 3 months of high-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) administered every 2 weeks (dose-dense) was equivalent to 6 months of CEF. We hypothesized that 3 months of paclitaxel after dose-dense EC (EC/T) would be superior to CEF or AC/T. METHODS: After lumpectomy or mastectomy, women 60 years of age or younger with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive CEF, EC/T, or AC/T for 6 months. This article reports the interim analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS), which was planned after 227 recurrences. RESULTS: A total of 2,104 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up is 30.4 months. Hazard ratios for recurrence are as follows: AC/T versus CEF, 1.49 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.99), P = .005; AC/T versus EC/T, 1.68 (95% CI, 1.25 to 2.27), P = .0006; and EC/T versus CEF, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.22), P = .46. Three-year RFS rates for CEF, EC/T, and AC/T are 90.1%, 89.5%, and 85.0%, respectively. There was more febrile neutropenia with CEF (22.3%) and EC/T (16.4%) compared with AC/T (4.8%), but more neuropathy with the last two regimens. CONCLUSION: Three-weekly AC/T is significantly inferior to CEF or EC/T in terms of RFS. It is too early to detect any difference between CEF and dose-dense EC/T.</docText>

        <docText>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Shows Similar Response in Patients With Inflammatory or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer When Compared With Operable Breast Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of the GeparTrio Trial Data.

PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by mastectomy is the treatment of choice in patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), but it is considered less effective in these diseases than in operable breast cancer (OBC). We report a prospective comparison of the GeparTrio trial of patients with IBC (cT4 days) or LABC (cT4a-c or cN3; stage IIIB or IIIC) and patients with OBC (cT2-3). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were stratified by stage and were randomly assigned to six or eight cycles of docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (TAC) or to two cycles of TAC followed by four cycles of vinorelbine/capecitabine. We present results of a secondary aim of the study, which was to compare pathologic complete response (pCR; ie, no remaining invasive/noninvasive tumor in breast and lymph nodes) in different stage groups. RESULTS: A total of 287 patients with IBC (n = 93) or LABC (n = 194) and 1,777 patients with OBC were entered onto the trial. At baseline, parameters were as follows for the three types of cancer, respectively: median tumor sizes: 8.0 cm, 7.0 cm, and 4.0 cm (P &lt; .001); multiple lesions: 31.2%, 27.3%, and 19.6% (P &lt; .001); nodal involvement: 86.6%, 71.2%, and 51.6% (P &lt; .001); grade 3: 44.4%, 30.4%, and 39.9% (P = .178); lobular-invasive type: 7.5%, 17.5%, and 13.3% (P = .673); negative hormone receptor status: 38.0%, 20.0%, and 36.4% (P = .008); and positive human growth factor receptor 2 status: 45.1%, 38.9%, and 35.7% (P = .158). Response rates for IBC, LABC, and OBC, respectively, were 8.6%, 11.3%, and 17.7% for pCR (P = .002); 71.0%, 69.6%, and 83.4% for overall response by physical or sonographic examination (P &lt; .001); and 12.9%, 33.0%, and 69.9% for breast conservation (P &lt; .001). All P values were for IBC and LABC versus OBC. However, tumor stage itself was not an independent predictor for pCR in multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.59; P = .13). CONCLUSION: No evidence of a difference in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was found by tumor stage when analysis was adjusted for baseline characteristics.</docText>

        <docText>Aortic Stiffness Increases Upon Receipt of Anthracycline Chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Cancer survivors exposed to anthracyclines experience an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. We hypothesized that anthracycline use may increase aortic stiffness, a known predictor of CV events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, case-control study involving 53 patients: 40 individuals who received an anthracycline for the treatment of breast cancer, lymphoma, or leukemia (cases), and 13 age- and sex-matched controls. Each participant underwent phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures of pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic distensibility (AoD) in the thoracic aorta at baseline, and 4 months after initiation of chemotherapy. Four one-way analyses of covariance models were fit in which factors known to influence thoracic aortic stiffness were included as covariates in the models. RESULTS: At the 4-month follow-up visit, aortic stiffness remained similar to baseline in the control participants. However, in the participants receiving anthracyclines, aortic stiffness increased markedly (relative to baseline), as evidenced by a decrease in AoD (P &lt; .0001) and an increase in PWV (P &lt; .0001). These changes in aortic stiffness persisted after accounting for age, sex, cardiac output, administered cardioactive medications, and underlying clinical conditions known to influence aortic stiffness, such as hypertension or diabetes (P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSION: A significant increase in aortic stiffness occurs within 4 months of exposure to an anthracycline which was not seen in an untreated control group. These results indicate that previously regarded cardiotoxic cancer therapy adversely increases thoracic aortic stiffness, a known independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events.</docText>

        <docText>Comparison of Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network Models in Breast Cancer Risk Estimation.

Computer models in medical diagnosis are being developed to help physicians differentiate between healthy patients and patients with disease. These models can aid in successful decision making by allowing calculation of disease likelihood on the basis of known patient characteristics and clinical test results. Two of the most frequently used computer models in clinical risk estimation are logistic regression and an artificial neural network. A study was conducted to review and compare these two models, elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of each, and provide criteria for model selection. The two models were used for estimation of breast cancer risk on the basis of mammographic descriptors and demographic risk factors. Although they demonstrated similar performance, the two models have unique characteristics-strengths as well as limitations-that must be considered and may prove complementary in contributing to improved clinical decision making.</docText>

        <docText>SAFB1 mediates repression of immune regulators and apoptotic genes in breast cancer cells.

The scaffold attachment factors SAFB1 and SAFB2 are paralogs, which are involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, and stress response. They have been shown to function as estrogen receptor co-repressors, and there is evidence for a role in breast tumorigenesis. To identify their endogenous target genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we utilized a combined approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip, and a gene expression array studies. By performing ChIP-on-chip on microarrays containing 24,000 promoters, we identified 541 SAFB1/SAFB2 binding sites in promoters of known genes, with significant enrichment on chromosome 1 and 6. Gene expression analysis revealed that the majority of target genes were induced in the absence of SAFB1 or SAFB2, and less were repressed. Interestingly, there was no significant overlap between the genes identified by ChIP-on-chip, and gene expression array analysis, suggesting regulation through regions outside the proximal promoters. In contrast to SAFB2, which shared most of its target genes with SAFB1, SAFB1 had many unique target genes, most of them involved in regulation of the immune system. A subsequent analysis of the estrogen treatment group revealed that twelve percent of estrogen-regulated genes were dependent on SAFB1, with the majority being estrogen-repressed genes. These were primarily genes involved in apoptosis, such as BBC3, NEDD9, and OPG. Thus, this study confirms SAFB1/SAFB2s primary role as co-repressors, and also uncovers a previously unknown role for SAFB1 in regulation of immune genes, and in estrogen-mediated repression of genes.</docText>

        <docText>North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N0432: phase II trial of docetaxel with capecitabine and bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Docetaxel (T; Taxotere) with capecitabine (X) is active against metastatic breast cancer (MBC); bevacizumab (BV) has demonstrated efficacy with taxanes in the first-line setting. This study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of TX-BV in patients with MBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single-arm, multicenter phase II study, patients received first-line bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 and capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days 1-14 every 21 days. Primary and secondary end points were tumor response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 45 assessable patients received TX-BV for a median of seven cycles. Two complete and 20 partial responses were observed (overall RR 49%); nine patients had stable disease &gt;6 months, for a clinical benefit rate of 69%. Median response duration was 11.8 months. Median OS and PFS were 28.4 and 11.1 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events included hand-foot syndrome (29%), fatigue (20%), febrile neutropenia (18%), and diarrhea (18%). In cycles 3-10, median dose levels of docetaxel and capecitabine were 60 mg/m(2) and 660 mg/m(2), respectively. CONCLUSION: TX-BV demonstrated significant activity; dose modifications were required to manage drug-related toxic effects.</docText>

        <docText>Progression-free survival as surrogate and as true end point: insights from the breast and colorectal cancer literature.

Significant achievements in the systemic treatment of both advanced breast cancer and advanced colorectal cancer over the past 10 years have led to a growing number of drugs, combinations, and sequences to be tested. The choice of surrogate and true end points has become a critical issue and one that is currently the subject of much debate. Many recent randomized trials in solid tumor oncology have used progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary end point. PFS is an attractive end point because it is available earlier than overall survival (OS) and is not influenced by second-line treatments. PFS is now undergoing validation as a surrogate end point in various disease settings. The question of whether PFS can be considered an acceptable surrogate end point depends not only on formal validation studies but also on a standardized definition and unbiased ascertainment of disease progression in clinical trials. In advanced breast cancer, formal validation of PFS as a surrogate for OS has so far been unsuccessful. In advanced colorectal cancer, in contrast, current evidence indicates that PFS is a valid surrogate for OS after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. The other question is whether PFS sufficiently reflects clinical benefit to be considered a true end point in and of itself.</docText>

        <docText>Triple-negative breast cancer--current status and future directions.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. It is characterized by distinct molecular, histological and clinical features including a particularly unfavorable prognosis despite increased sensitivity to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. TNBC is highly though not completely concordant with various definitions of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) defined by high-throughput gene expression analyses. The lack in complete concordance may in part be explained by both BLBC and TNBC comprising entities that in themselves are heterogeneous. Numerous efforts are currently being undertaken to improve prognosis for patients with TNBC. They comprise both optimization of choice and scheduling of common cytotoxic agents (i.e. addition of platinum salts or dose intensification strategies) and introduction of novel agents (i.e. poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase-1 inhibitors, agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, multityrosine kinase inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents).</docText>

        <docText>Rates of atypical ductal hyperplasia have declined with less use of postmenopausal hormone treatment: findings from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.

AIM: To examine risk factors and rates of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) with and without associated breast cancer over time and tumor characteristics of breast cancer with and without associated ADH in women previously screened with mammography. METHODS: Data on screening mammograms done between 1996 and 2005 were collected from mammography registries that participate in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Associations between age, family history of breast cancer, postmenopausal hormone treatment (HT), and final pathology result (ADH or cancer with or without ADH in the same breast) were examined. Rates of different outcomes were calculated per exam year. Tumor characteristics of cancers with and without associated ADH were compared. RESULTS: A total of 2,453,483 screening mammograms were associated with 1,064 biopsies with ADH, 833 breast cancers with ADH, and 8,161 cancers with no ADH. Postmenopausal HT use decreased significantly from 35% to 11% during the study period. Rates of ADH decreased from a peak of 5.5/10,000 mammograms in 1999 to 2.4/10,000 in 2005. Rates of cancer with ADH decreased from a peak of 4.3/10,000 mammograms in 2003 to 3.3/10,000 in 2005. ADH and breast cancer were significantly associated with use of postmenopausal HT. Cancer associated with ADH was of lower grade and stage and more estrogen receptor positive than cancer with no ADH. Summary: Postmenopausal HT is associated with an increased risk of ADH with or without cancer. Rates of ADH have decreased over the past decade, which may be partially explained by the significant reduction in use of postmenopausal HT.</docText>

        <docText>Expression of MRP1, BCRP, LRP, and ERCC1 in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: correlation with response to chemotherapy and survival.

PURPOSE: We investigated the prognostic value of the expression of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), lung resistance-related protein (LRP), and excision repair cross-complementing group-1 (ERCC1) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for detecting the expression of MRP1, BCRP, LRP, and ERCC1 mRNA in 66 transbronchial biopsy (TBB) samples from untreated patients with advanced NSCLC. All of the patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Response to chemotherapy, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared in relation to expression of each gene and clinicopathologic factors. RESULTS: Results showed that tumor stage (P = .028) and the expression of MRP1 (P = .046) and LRP (P = .012) correlated with response to chemotherapy. Poor performance status (PS; P = .016), advanced tumor stage (P = .004), and the high expression of MRP1 (P = .012) and LRP (P = .002) predicted poorer PFS. Performance status (P = .009); tumor stage (P = .003); and the expression of MRP1 (P = .017), LRP (P = .005), and ERCC1 (P = .002) were predictive for OS. In a Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis, PS (P = .042), tumor stage (P = .007), and the expression of LRP (P = .011) and ERCC1 (P = .026) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that determination of MRP1, LRP, and ERCC1 mRNA expression using RT-PCR in TBB samples might be helpful in predicting outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and in optimizing therapeutic strategy based on the expression of these genes.</docText>

        <docText>Cancer incidence rate ratios of Turkish immigrants in Hamburg, Germany: A registry based study.

The aim of this study was to estimate cancer incidence rate ratios for Turkish migrants in Hamburg, Germany. We used a name-based approach and identified 1346 cases with Turkish names (as a proxy of Turkish origin) among 140,249 cases of cancer registered in the cancer registry Hamburg during 1990-2005. To estimate the size of the denominator population, we applied the name-based approach to the population of Hamburg as well. The cancer incidence of specific cancer sites was compared between Turkish and non-Turkish cases using incidence rate ratios (IRR), stratified by gender and birth cohort. Our main findings are that cancer of the respiratory organs is diagnosed less frequent among Turkish men in older birth cohorts but with higher frequency in the younger birth cohorts. Malignant neoplasms of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissues are slightly higher in most male Turkish men birth cohorts, and even considerably higher for the birth cohort 1961 to &lt;1971 (IRR=1.8). Among women, incidence rates for Turkish women are lower than for non-Turkish women for cancer of the respiratory system, skin cancer and cancer of genital organs. Also, breast cancer incidence rates of Turkish women are lower than for non-Turkish women, especially in older birth cohorts. Incidence rate ratios of neoplasms of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissues are low in the 1931 to &lt;1941 cohort (IRR=0.71) but increase in younger birth cohorts. In conclusion, we found differences in cancer risks between cases with and without Turkish names for specific cancer sites. These results are consistent with the findings of studies from other countries.</docText>

        <docText>ATP modulates transcription factors through P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) receptors via PKC/MAPKs and PKC/Src pathways in MCF-7 cells.

In this work, we studied the involvement of PKC and Src in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1 MAPKs and in the modulation of ATF-1, c-Fos, c-Jun and Jun D transcription factors by ATP in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RT-PCR studies and nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed first the expression of P2Y(2)- and P2Y(4)-receptor subtypes. The use of specific inhibitors and Src antisense oligonucleotides showed that PKC, but not Src, plays a role in the phosphorylation of MAPKs by ATP. ATP stimulated the expression of c-Fos and the phosphorylation c-Jun, Jun D and ATF-1. PKC and Src only participated in c-Fos induction and in ATF-1 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of MAPKs demonstrated that c-Fos induction and phosphorylation of c-Jun and Jun D, but not of ATF-1, depend on MAPK activation. These results suggest that stimulation of P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) receptors by ATP modulates transcription factors through PKC/MAPKs and PKC/Src pathways in MCF-7 cells.</docText>

        <docText>Application of (19)F magnetic resonance to study the efficacy of fluorine labeled drugs in the three dimensional cultured breast cancer cells.

The cellular monitoring of tumor response to treatments is important for drug discovery and drug development in cancer therapy. We studied efficacy of Herceptin, a common breast cancer drug conjugated with a fluorine organic compound, perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) which easily forms biocompatible emulsions. Three new pharmaceutical forms of Herceptin, Herceptin/PFCE, Herceptin/PFCE/Lipoplex and Herceptin/PFCE/HydraLink were synthesized for the ex vivo study of their efficacy in breast cancer treatment. The emulsions were administered to 10(9) cells.mL(-1) of HER-2 positive human adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells and the same amount of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) cultured in three dimensional (3-D) geometry using Hollow Fiber Bioreactor (HFB) device. Following drugs administration ex vivo, fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging ((19)F MRI) was applied for cells imaging to measure their viability and to study drug efficacy over 72 h. To ensure optimum drug tracking, HydraLink was used to provide stable binding affinity of emulsified Herceptin to receptor while cationic lipid (Lipofectamine) was used to enhance lipophylicity of the emulsions. After 72 h of treatment with Herceptin, Herceptin/PFCE, Herceptin/PFCE/Lipoplex and Herceptin/PFCE/HydraLink the viability of cells was 54 +/- 2%, 49 +/- 3%, 43 +/- 5% and 42 +/- 1%, respectively as compared with control 93 +/- 2%. The efficacy (EC(50)) of Herceptin conjugated with emulsions was found to be 970 +/- 13 mug.mL(-1) for Herceptin/PFCE, 645 +/- 11 mug.mL(-1) for Herceptin/PFCE/Lipoplex, 678 +/- 7 mug.mL(-1) for Herceptin/PFCE/HydraLink and 1000 +/- 3 mug.mL(-1) for Herceptin. The results show that fluorine emulsions improved the efficacy of Herceptin and (19)F signal intensity changes validated drug efficiency. The significant correlations between duration of treatments and MCF-7 cells viability were observed. While we studied breast cancer cells, the fluorine emulsions could be applied for treatment of other cancer cells overexpressing HER-2.</docText>

        <docText>Suppose a mammary carcinoma is absent from the surgical specimen

In three women aged 53, 51, and 42 respectively, who were treated by breast-conserving surgery for mammary carcinoma, the cancer was not found in the surgical specimen. For both patient and treating physician it is rather worrying when there is no good explanation for the fact that a histologically proven breast cancer cannot be detected in the surgical specimen without neoadjuvant therapy having been given. It is important to revise the needle biopsies, to exclude mix up of patient materials, to totally include the resected specimen in the pathological examination and to perform addition imaging of the remaining breast, preferably with MRI. An explanation may be that biopsy has removed such an amount of tumour tissue that the remains are not found. If no flaws are apparent, adjuvant radiotherapy and further adjuvant therapy on indication suffices.</docText>

        <docText>Advantages and disadvantages of breast cancer screening: time for evidence-based information

Complaints about the partisan and poor information about mammographic screening go back as far as the introduction of the national screening programme. Research has shown that the great majority of women largely overestimate its advantages and ignore its disadvantages. This article outlines a structured draft of the advantages and disadvantages of breast cancer screening, framed as figures per 10,000 mammographies or 1000 women participating for 25 years with an average of 10 mammographies: 125 women are referred with a false positive diagnosis, 55 cancers are diagnosed during screening, and 21 cancers appear in the intervals between screening. Four women avoid death from breast cancer, 15 women die of breast cancer despite screening, and 51 women receive a diagnosis while screening which does not improve their prognosis, 16-20 of them are treated redundantly. These figures are based on the best evidence available, but are subject to further improvement.</docText>

        <docText>Second operation more frequent following breast-conserving treatment for invasive lobular than for invasive non-lobular carcinoma

OBJECTIVE: To establish the frequency of re-excision or mastectomy in women who had breast-conserving treatment for invasive lobular mammary carcinoma. DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: Data on the number of patients with invasive carcinoma from 1998-2006 were obtained from the national pathology database (PALGA) and the Dutch Comprehensive Cancer Centre East. The following data on patients who had undergone breast-conserving treatment for invasive lobular carcinoma were collected from the electronic patient records: age, localization procedure with wire-localisation and tumour size. RESULTS: The frequency of re-excision or mastectomy following initial breast-conserving surgery in 123 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma was 46.3 % versus 31.5 % in 877 patients with other types of invasive carcinoma. The number of re-excisions was higher in the group with invasive non-lobular carcinoma (4.9% versus 9.2%), and the number of conversions to mastectomy was higher in the group with invasive lobular carcinoma (41.5% versus 20.1%). The age of the patient, the localisation procedure and tumour size were not significant predictors of a tumour-free surgical margin or for the necessity of re-excision. CONCLUSION: The frequency of re-excision in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma was higher than in patients with other types of breast cancer. There was no statistically significant predictor for obtaining a tumour-free surgical margin.</docText>

        <docText>Changes in and predictors of length of stay in hospital after surgery for breast cancer between 1997/98 and 2004/05 in two regions of England: a population-based study.

BACKGROUND: Decreases in length of stay (LOS) in hospital after breast cancer surgery can be partly attributed to the change to less radical surgery, but many other factors are operating at the patient, surgeon and hospital levels. This study aimed to describe the changes in and predictors of length of stay (LOS) in hospital after surgery for breast cancer between 1997/98 and 2004/05 in two regions of England. METHODS: Cases of female invasive breast cancer diagnosed in two English cancer registry regions were linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for the period 1st April 1997 to 31st March 2005. A subset of records where women underwent mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS) was extracted (n = 44,877). Variations in LOS over the study period were investigated. A multilevel model with patients clustered within surgical teams and NHS Trusts was used to examine associations between LOS and a range of factors. RESULTS: Over the study period the proportion of women having a mastectomy reduced from 58% to 52%. The proportion varied from 14% to 80% according to NHS Trust. LOS decreased by 21% from 1997/98 to 2004/05 (LOSratio = 0.79, 95%CI 0.77-0.80). BCS was associated with 33% shorter hospital stays compared to mastectomy (LOSratio = 0.67, 95%CI 0.66-0.68). Older age, advanced disease, presence of comorbidities, lymph node excision and reconstructive surgery were associated with increased LOS. Significant variation remained amongst Trusts and surgical teams. CONCLUSION: The number of days spent in hospital after breast cancer surgery has continued to decline for several decades. The change from mastectomy to BCS accounts for only 9% of the overall decrease in LOS. Other explanations include the adoption of new techniques and practices, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy and early discharge. This study has identified wide variation in practice with substantial cost implications for the NHS. Further work is required to explain this variation.</docText>

        <docTitle>Critical roles of T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase in cytokinesis.</docTitle>
        <docText>Critical roles of T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase in cytokinesis.

We previously reported up-regulation of T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a novel mitotic kinase, in the great majority of breast cancers. Here we report its critical roles in mitosis, especially in cytokinesis. We found that protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1alpha) inactivation by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B1 caused enhancement of autophosphorylation of TOPK and resulted in its activation at an early stage of mitosis. Then TOPK interacted with and phosphorylated p97, a member of the AAA+ family of ATPase proteins, through an interaction with p47 protein as an adaptor protein. Interestingly, knockdown of TOPK or p97 in breast cancer cells caused the mitotic failures in the abscission process. This mitotic failure could be rescued by additional exogenous introduction of wild-type TOPK protein, but not by that of its kinase-dead form. Our findings suggest that TOPK is indispensable for cancer cell cytokinesis throughout phosphorylation on p97. (Cancer Sci 2009).</docText>

        <docText>Detection of cutaneous HPV types 4 and 24 DNA sequences in breast carcinoma in Singaporean women of Asian ancestry.

AIM: To date, there have been conflicting data on the prevalence of HPV in primary breast carcinoma, with a median prevalence of 35%. We believe that the low prevalence reported could be due to use of inappropriate amplification primers and methods of detection. We designed a study to detect and reflect more accurately the incidence of both mucosal and cutaneous HPV types in breast carcinoma among Singaporean women. METHODS: In our study, we used two different molecular techniques, both of which involved a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification step for any HPV DNA found in the breast cancer tissues. The first method targeted primarily the mucosal HPV types, and the second, primarily the cutaneous HPV types. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers were used for the studies. The first method involved the GP5+/GP6+ primers for PCR amplification and a commercially available HPV DNA genotyping chip for detection. The subsequent studies involved the use of the FAB 59/64 primers for amplification, followed by DNA sequencing and comparison to the NCBI GenBank database for the detection of all possible HPV types. RESULTS: With the first technique, all 92 breast cancers tested gave negative results for HPV DNA, suggesting the absence of HPV types in breast cancers. Using the second method, we detected HPV sequences in 32/92 (35%) samples, of which 28 were shown to be HPV-4, one was HPV-24, two had mixed HPV types and one had an indeterminate HPV sequence that did not match any of the HPV sequences deposited in the GenBank database. CONCLUSIONS: These results were consistent with our hypothesis that the true incidence of HPV in breast carcinoma is much higher than those reported to date, and that this is probably due to the limited sensitivity of the molecular techniques used in earlier studies.</docText>

        <docTitle>An Essential Epitope of Anti-MUC1 Monoclonal Antibody KL-6 Revealed by Focused Glycopeptide Library.</docTitle>
        <docText>An Essential Epitope of Anti-MUC1 Monoclonal Antibody KL-6 Revealed by Focused Glycopeptide Library.

Human serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) antigen, a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein classified as a polymorphic epithelial mucin (MUC1), is a biomarker of diseases such as interstitial pneumonia, lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-KL-6 monoclonal antibody (anti-KL-6 MAb) is therefore a potential diagnostic and therapeutic reagent. Although glycosylation at Thr/Ser residues of the tandem-repeating MUC1 peptides appears to determine the disease-associated antigenic structures of KL-6, an essential epitope structure recognized by anti-KL-6 MAb remains unclear. In the present study, a novel compound library of synthetic MUC1 glycopeptides allowed the first rapid and precise evaluation of the specific epitope structure of anti-KL-6 MAb by combined use of a tailored glycopeptides library and common ELISA protocol. We demonstrated that the minimal antigenic structure, an essential epitope, recognized by anti-KL-6 MAb is a heptapeptide sequence Pro-Asp-Thr-Arg-Pro-Ala-Pro (PDTRPAP), in which the Thr residue is modified by Neu5Acalpha2,3Galbeta1,3GalNAcalpha (2,3-sialyl T antigen, core 1-type O-glycan). Anti-KL-6 MAb did not bind with other tumor-relevant antigens, such as GalNAcalpha (Tn), Neu5Acalpha2,6GalNAcalpha (STn), and Galbeta1,3GalNAcalpha (T), except for Neu5Acalpha2,3Galbeta1,3(Neu5Acalpha2,6)GalNAcalpha (2,3/2,6-disialyl T). However, anti-KL-6 MAb could not differentiate the above minimal antigenic glycopeptide from some core 2-based glycopeptides involving this crucial epitope structure and showed a similar binding affinity toward these compounds, indicating that branching at the O-6 position of GalNAc residue does not influence the interaction of anti-KL-6 MAb with some MUC1 glycoproteins involving an essential epitope. Actually, anti-KL-6 MAb reacts with 2,3/2,6-disialyl T having a 2,3-sialyl T component. This is why anti-KL-6 MAb often reacts with various kinds of tumor-derived MUC1 glycoproteins as well as a clinically important MUC1 glycoprotein biomarker of interstitial pneumonia, namely KL-6, originally discovered as a circulating pulmonary adenocarcinoma-associated antigen. In other words, combined use of anti-KL-6 MAb and some probes that can differentiate the sugars substituted at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue in MUC1 glycopeptides including the PDTRPAP sequence might be a promising diagnostic protocol for individual disease-specific biomarkers. It was also revealed that glycosylation at neighboring Thr/Ser residues outside the immunodominant PDTRPAP motif strongly influences the interaction between anti-KL-6 MAb and MUC1 glycopeptides involving the identified epitope. Our novel strategy will greatly facilitate the processes for the identification of the tumor-specific and strong epitopes of various known anti-MUC1 MAbs and allow for their practical application in the generation of improved antibody immunotherapeutics, diagnostics, and MUC1-based cancer vaccines.</docText>

        <docText>Polymeric Phosphorylcholine-Camptothecin Conjugates Prepared by Controlled Free Radical Polymerization and Click Chemistry.

Novel polymer-drug conjugates, consisting of zwitterionic poly(methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (polyMPC) as the polymer component, and camptothecin (CPT) as the drug, were prepared by two methods. In one case, CPT was transformed by acylation into a functional initiator for copper catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), and polyMPC was grown from this therapeutic initiator. In the other case, a one-pot ATRP-"click" conjugation strategy was employed to synthesize novel polyMPC structures containing multiple copies of the drug pendant to the zwitterionic polymer chain. The latter method allows polyMPC-graft-CPT conjugates to be prepared with a high weight percent drug loading (up to 14% CPT) with excellent solubility in pure water (&gt;250 mg/mL). The linkage chemistry chosen between the polyMPC backbone and the pendant drugs proved critically important for assuring drug release within a time frame reasonable to consider these structures as a platform for injectable cancer therapeutics. Liberation of the drug from the polymer backbone was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography, using size-exclusion and reverse-phase columns, and the toxicity of the polymer-drug conjugates was examined in cell culture against breast (MCF7), ovarian (OVCAR-3), and colorectal (COLO 205) cancer cell lines.</docText>

        <docText>Social aspects of breast cancer early detection after introduction of population screenings in Poland

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation the participation of women in prophylactic and educational program according their declarations and also the role of health service, after introduction the population screenings in the country in years: 2006 and 2007. Identify the most neglected groups in this field. METHODS: In 2008 the questionnaire survey were conducted in representative sample of Polish women. They were asked about their health behaviors as: attending mammography, to the doctors for examination their breast and breast self examination. The most important results were compared with results of similar survey in 1998. RESULT: It was observed the substantial increase of women in the age risk groups (45-54, 55-64, 65+ years old) who declared attending mammography in the last two years in 2008 in comparison with 1998 accordingly: 26%, 39%, and 14%. Also the increase of percent of village women declared this method of early detection of breast cancer in the same period was significant--28%. The most neglected groups of women in the aspect of prophylactic of breast cancer were women in the age over 65 years old and women from the village area. CONCLUSION: (1) It is important to continue educational work and intervention measures concerning breast cancer prevention, with special attention to the most neglected groups of women. (2) It would be important to continue educating doctors in prophylactic breast examination. (3) Most stress should be done on the promotion of active breast cancer screening program.</docText>

        <docText>Radiological control intraoperatory of a surgical piece in non palpable breast lesions

BACKGROUND: nonconcrete the mammary injuries are frequent in programs of detection of breast cancer, estereotaxic or ecographic marking is required to realize its split. The intrasurgical radiation control of the surgical piece is indispensable to evaluate the margins of the mammary cancer. OBJECTIVE: to determine the effectiveness of the intrasurgical radiation control of the surgical piece in nonconcrete mammary injuries to diminish the surgical reinterventions to extend margins. Patients and method: women with nonconcrete mammary injuries to those who biopsy by split became, previous marking and intraoperating radiation control of the surgical piece to value margins (suitable margin the same or major of 10 mm, smaller inadequate margin of 10 mm). Intrasurgical reesicion in inadequate radiological margins became. The demographic characteristics, masto-ecographics images, histopathology of the injuries and the radiological-histopatol6gica correlation of the margins studied. Cross-sectional, prospective and descriptive study. RESULTS: 103 patients with 113 nonconcrete mammary injuries included themselves, with age average of 51,35 (32-73) years. In all the injuries the intrasurgical radiation control became of the surgical piece. The prevalence of mammary cancer was of 28.3% (32/113), that corresponds to stellar images (42.8%), suspicious microcalcifications with density (39.2%), microcalcifications (31.2%) and nodules (20%). Of the 32 cancers, 16 had inadequate radiological margins that required intraoperating reescision; suitable histopatologic margins in 100% were obtained (16/16). The 16 (62.5%) cancers without intraoperating reescisi6n by suitable radiological margins had suitable histopatologic margins and 37.5% (6/16) inadequate ones that required surgical reinterventionn to control the margins. The discrepancy between margins was related to microcalcifications in 83.3% of the injuries. CONCLUSIONS: the intrasurgical radiation control of the surgical piece is effective to evaluate margins; the intrasurgical reescisión changed inadequate margins to suitable in 50% (16/32) of the cancers; only 18.7% (6/32) of the total of cases required another surgery to control the margins.</docText>

        <docText>Fallopian tube cancer presenting as inflammatory breast carcinoma: report of a case and review of the literature.

Metastases of ovarian or fallopian tube carcinomas to the breast and axillary lymph nodes are quite uncommon and usually occur in advanced stages. These metastases may represent a pitfall for the pathologist, because they may mimic primary breast carcinoma. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a left-sided pelvic tumor, redness and swelling of the right breast and palpable right axillary nodes and left lower neck and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The imaging, surgical and pathologic findings were those of a papillary serous carcinoma of the fallopian tube with metastases to the breast, axillary and neck lymph nodes. It is important that metastasis to the breast be differentiated accurately from primary breast cancer, because prognosis and treatment differ significantly. Imaging, immunohistochemical analysis and pathology can help in making the correct diagnosis.</docText>

        <docText>What is the diagnostic value of nipple discharge cytology and galactography in detecting duct pathology?

The present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of nipple discharge (ND) cytology and galactography. Ninety-four patients submitted to duct excision, representing a total of 98 duct excisions, were retrospectively analyzed from January 1997 to May 2007. Histology of ducts excised revealed 35% duct ectasia (DE), 31% duct papilloma (DP), 20% potential malignant transforming lesions (PMTL), 6% breast cancer (BC), 1% adenoma and 6% normal breast tissue. Cytology had a sensibility and specificity in detecting duct pathology of, respectively, 40% and 61.3%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 53.8% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 47.5%. Concerning malignant and PMTL, cytology had a sensibility and specificity of, respectively, 46.2% and 62.3%, a PPV of 25% and a NPV of 82.5%. Breast cancer was never suggested by positive cytology. Galactography had a sensibility and specificity in detecting duct pathology of, respectively, 77.4% and 29.2%, a PPV of 58.5% and a NPV of 50%. For malignant and PMTL, galactography had a sensibility and specificity of, respectively, 80% and 26.7%, a PPV of 19.5% and a NPV of 85.7%. However, galactography never suggested a diagnosis of cancer. Cytology and galactography performed together in 49% showed a low Kappa Index (KI &lt; 1), allowing us to conclude that cytology and galactography detect different pathologies. Cytology showed a poor performance in predicting histological diagnosis in face of ND. Galactography had a good sensibility in excluding malignant lesions and PMTL. Galactography was significantly more sensitive for duct pathology but cytology was more specific for malignant lesions and PMTL.</docText>

        <docText>Mutational analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Mexican breast cancer patients.

Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. A variable incidence of mutations has been reported for these genes. The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to Mexican women with breast and/or ovarian cancer is not known. Because of the increasing prevalence of breast cancer in this population, it is necessary to study the presence of mutations in both genes. We screened BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 40 patients: 29 patients with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, and 11 patients with early-onset breast cancer (&lt; 40 years), through denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analyses. We found two frameshift mutations in BRCA1 and one missense mutation in each gene. Additionally we found several intronic variants as well as synonymous mutations. We found 5% of deleterious mutations in the BRCA genes. Larger studies are needed to establish the significance and prevalence of BRCA mutations among Mexican women.</docText>

        <docText>Histamine and its metabolizing enzymes in tissues of primary ductal breast cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate histamine concentrations in plasma and tissues of breast cancers depending on the activity of histamine metabolic enzymes in neoplasmatic tissues of the breast gland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 95 women aged 38-70 years the concentration of histamine in the plasma by the immunoenzymatic method, the concentration of histamine in breast cancer tissues and metabolism enzymes of histamine: histidine decarboxylase, decarboxylase of aromatic L-amino acid, N-histamine methyltransferase, monoamine oxydase B, diamine oxydase determined using an isotope technique were assessed. The 24-hour excretion of N-methylimidazolacetate acid was evaluated by the chromatography method. RESULTS: Significant increases were found of histamine concentrations in plasma tissues of ductal breast cancers, activity of histidine decarboxylase, aromatic L-amino acid and histamine methyltransferase. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Concentrations of histamine in plasma is dependent on the concentration of histamine in the tissues of ductal breast cancers. 2. Significant increases of histamine in cancerous tissues of ductal breast cancer could suggest the participation of this monoamine in the development of breast cancer. 3. The increase of histamine concentrations in ductal breast cancer tissues can be connected with disturbances in the balance between synthesis and enzymatic activation of this monoamine. 4. The concentration of histamine in plasma of women with ductal breast cancers is dependent on the number of lymph nodes and grade of histological malignancy.</docText>

Breast cancer screening programmes have been integrated in a systematic way into the public health policies of numerous countries. Breast cancer is indeed one of the (rare) health issues which answers the criteria necessary to organize a screening on a large scale. The different methods of diagnosis and the results of various strategies (based on randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis) are described and compared. This reveals that the Belgian policy in this matter is and remains founded today: a standardized mammotest every 2 years for all women from 50 to 69.</docText>

        <docText>Identification of single chain antibodies to breast cancer stem cells using phage display.

Recent evidence suggests that most malignancies are driven by "cancer stem cells" sharing the signature characteristics of adult stem cells: the ability to self renew and to differentiate. Furthermore these cells are thought to be quiescent, infrequently dividing cells with a natural resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. These studies theorize that therapies, which effectively treat the majority of tumor cells but 'miss' the stem cell population, will fail, while therapies directed at stern cells can potentially eradicate tumors. In breast cancer, researchers have isolated 'breast cancer stem cells' capable of recreating the tumor in vivo and in vitro. Generated new tumors contained both additional numbers of cancer stem cells and diverse mixed populations of cells present in the initial tumor, supporting the intriguing self-renewal and differentiation characteristics. In the present study, an antibody phage library has been used to search for phage displayed-single chain antibodies (scFv) with selective affinity to specific targets on breast cancer stem cells. We demonstrate evidence of two clones binding specifically to a cancer stem cell population isolated from the SUMl59 breast cancer cell line. These clones had selective affinity for cancer stem cells and they were able to select cancer stem cells among a large population of non-stem cancer cells in paraffin-embedded sections. The applicability of these clones to paraffin sections and frozen tissue specimens made them good candidates to be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in breast cancer patient samples taking into consideration the cancer stern cell concept in tumor biology.

        <docText>Meta-analysis of pairs of survival curves under heterogeneity: A Poisson correlated gamma-frailty approach.

We address the problem of meta-analysis of pairs of survival curves under heterogeneity. Starting point for the meta-analysis is a set of studies, each comparing the same two treatments, containing information about multiple survival outcomes. Under heterogeneity, we model the number of events using an extension of the Poisson correlated gamma-frailty model with serial within-arm and positive between-arm correlations.The parameters of the models are estimated following a two-stage estimation procedure. In the first stage the underlying hazards and between-study variance are estimated using the marginals, while a second stage is used to estimate both within-arm and between-arm correlations. The methodology is illustrated with an observational study on breast cancer. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</docText>

        <docTitle>GM-CSF is one of the main breast tumor-derived soluble factors involved in the differentiation of CD11b-Gr1- bone marrow progenitor cells into myeloid-derived suppressor cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>GM-CSF is one of the main breast tumor-derived soluble factors involved in the differentiation of CD11b-Gr1- bone marrow progenitor cells into myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

Recent reports have shown the involvement of tumor burden as well as GM-CSF in supporting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). However, it is not known what progenitor cells may differentiate into MDSC in the presence of GM-CSF, and whether FVBN202 transgenic mouse model of spontaneous breast carcinoma may exhibit distinct subset distribution of CD11b+Gr1+ cells. In addition, it is not known why CD11b+Gr1+ cells derived from tumor-free and tumor-bearing animals exhibit different functions. In this study, we determined that GM-CSF was one of the tumor-derived soluble factors that induced differentiation of CD11b-Gr1- progenitor cells from within monocytic/granulocytic bone marrow cells into CD11b+Gr1+ cells. We also showed that CD11b+Gr1+ cells in FVBN202 mice consisted of CD11b+Ly6G-Ly6C+ suppressive and CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6C+ non-suppressive subsets. Previously reported variations between tumor-free and tumor-bearing animals in the function of their CD11b+Gr1+ cells were found to be due to the variations in the proportion of these two subsets. Therefore, increasing ratios of CD11b+Gr1+ cells derived from tumor-free animals revealed their suppressive activity on T cells, in vitro. Importantly, GM-CSF supported the generation of CD11b+Ly6G-Ly6C+ suppressor subsets that inhibited proliferation as well as anti-tumor function of neu-specific T cells. These findings suggest revisiting the use of GM-CSF for the expansion of dendritic cells, ex vivo, for cell-based immunotherapy or as an adjuvant for vaccines for patients with cancer in whom MDSC play a major role in the suppression of anti-tumor immune responses.</docText>

        <docText>Clinical relevance of the putative stem cell marker p63 in breast cancer.

P63 is a member of the p53 family. This protein is crucial for the maintenance of a stem cell population in the human epithelium and necessary for the normal development of all epithelial tissues including mammary glands. In normal breast tissue, the p63 seems to be a specific myoepithelial cell marker. P63 expression has been described in highly aggressive ER negative basal-like breast tumors. The value of p63 expression in ER positive disease is less clear. The expression levels of p63 mRNA by Affymetrix microarray analysis in a combined cohort of 2,158 ER positive breast cancers and its prognostic and predictive impact were analyzed. Tumor samples containing large amounts of benign breast tissue, which will interfere with p63 measurement, were excluded prior to the analysis. Survival analysis revealed a better prognosis of ER positive breast cancer expressing p63 (n = 410; P &lt; 0.036). No correlation of p63 with standard parameters was observed. In a subgroup analysis, endocrine-treated patients with high p63 expression showed a better prognosis than low p63 expression (P = 0.06; n = 186). In untreated patients, this effect was less clear (n = 148; P = 0.5). P63 is a positive prognostic factor in endocrine-treated ER positive breast cancer and might influence responsiveness to endocrine treatment. Thus, p63 could be helpful as a predictive factor for endocrine therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Targeting breast stem cells with the cancer preventive compounds curcumin and piperine.

The cancer stem cell hypothesis asserts that malignancies arise in tissue stem and/or progenitor cells through the dysregulation or acquisition of self-renewal. In order to determine whether the dietary polyphenols, curcumin, and piperine are able to modulate the self-renewal of normal and malignant breast stem cells, we examined the effects of these compounds on mammosphere formation, expression of the breast stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and Wnt signaling. Mammosphere formation assays were performed after curcumin, piperine, and control treatment in unsorted normal breast epithelial cells and normal stem and early progenitor cells, selected by ALDH positivity. Wnt signaling was examined using a Topflash assay. Both curcumin and piperine inhibited mammosphere formation, serial passaging, and percent of ALDH+ cells by 50% at 5 muM and completely at 10 muM concentration in normal and malignant breast cells. There was no effect on cellular differentiation. Wnt signaling was inhibited by both curcumin and piperine by 50% at 5 muM and completely at 10 muM. Curcumin and piperine separately, and in combination, inhibit breast stem cell self-renewal but do not cause toxicity to differentiated cells. These compounds could be potential cancer preventive agents. Mammosphere formation assays may be a quantifiable biomarker to assess cancer preventive agent efficacy and Wnt signaling assessment can be a mechanistic biomarker for use in human clinical trials.</docText>

        <docText>Examining Patient Conceptions: A Case of Metastatic Breast Cancer in an African American Male to Female Transgender Patient.

An African American male to female transgender patient treated with estrogen detected a breast lump that was confirmed by her primary care provider. The patient refused mammography and 14 months later she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer with spinal cord compression. We used ethnographic interviews and observations to elicit the patient's conceptions of her illness and actions. The patient identified herself as biologically male and socially female; she thought that the former protected her against breast cancer; she had fears that excision would make a breast tumor spread; and she believed injectable estrogens were less likely than oral estrogens to cause cancer. Analysis suggests dissociation between the patient's social and biological identities, fear and fatalism around cancer screening, and legitimization of injectable hormones. This case emphasizes the importance of eliciting and interpreting a patient's conceptions of health and illness when discordant understandings develop between patient and physician.</docText>

        <docText>Obesity and Angiolymphatic Invasion in Primary Breast Cancer.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with poorer breast cancer-specific survival. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between obesity and the presence of angiolymphatic invasion as well as other features of invasive breast cancer, including stage at presentation, estrogen receptor (ER) status, triple-negative phenotype, and tumor grade. METHODS: Detailed clinical and pathologic data were abstracted from the medical records of all 1,312 patients with stage I-III primary breast cancer who had breast surgery at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2006. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between body mass index and tumor biologic features, controlling for menopausal status, diabetes and hypertension, hormone replacement therapy before diagnosis, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, severe obesity was independently associated with the presence of angiolymphatic invasion [odds ratio (OR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.99, joint test of significance, P = 0.03]. Severe obesity was associated with lower likelihood of triple-negative breast cancer (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.96). Among premenopausal women with diabetes, ER-negative (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.12-24.29) and triple-negative (OR 14.8, 95% CI 1.92-113.91) disease was significantly more common. DISCUSSION: In this large sample of invasive breast cancers, obesity was independently associated with the presence of angiolymphatic invasion. Higher rates of angiolymphatic invasion among obese women may account in part for poorer outcomes among obese women with breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Analysis of the expression of hyaluronan in intraductal and invasive carcinomas of the breast.</docTitle>
        <docText>Analysis of the expression of hyaluronan in intraductal and invasive carcinomas of the breast.

AIMS: To evaluate hyaluronan expression at different stages of tumoral progression in primary breast cancer. METHODS: Hyaluronan expression was evaluated by histochemical techniques in 42 cases of pure DCIS, in 15 cases of DCIS with a microinvasive component, and in 32 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Staining results were evaluated by calculating the percentage of stained areas by means of a specific software program. RESULTS: Our results show higher values of hyaluronan expression in invasive breast carcinomas [median of percentage of stained areas 41.1 (range 8-69.2)] and in DCIS with a microinvasive component [48.6 (16.8-62.8)] than in pure DCIS [14.5 (1-44.4)] (p &lt; 0.001, for both). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates a proportionally higher area of hyaluronan expression in DCIS with a microinvasive component than in pure DCIS, suggesting a key role of this glycosaminoglycan in the early invasive phase of breast carcinomas. Thus, hyaluronan could play an important function in determining the migratory phenotype of cancer cells. Larger size tumors appear to demonstrate an intricate balance between hyaluronan synthesis and degradation, thus conditioning intratumoral heterogeneity in the hyaluronan metabolism.</docText>

        <docText>Triple-negative breast cancer: correlation between imaging and pathological findings.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the mammography and ultrasound findings of triple-negative breast cancer and to compare the results with characteristics of ER-positive/PR-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer and ER-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancer. METHODS: From January 2007 to October 2008, mammography and ultrasound findings of 245 patients with pathologically confirmed triple-negative (n = 87), ER-positive/PR-negative/HER2-negative (n = 93) or ER-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancers (n = 65) were retrospectively reviewed. We also reviewed pathological reports for information on the histological type, histological grade and the status of the biological markers. RESULTS: Triple-negative breast cancers showed a high histological grade. On mammography, triple-negative breast cancers usually presented with a mass (43/87, 49%) or with focal asymmetry (19/87, 22%), and were less associated with calcifications. On ultrasound, the cancers were less frequently seen as non-mass lesions (12/87, 14%), more likely to have circumscribed margins (43/75, 57%), were markedly hypoechoic (36/75, 57%) and less likely to show posterior shadowing (4/75, 5%). Among the three types of breast cancers, ER-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancers most commonly had associated calcifications (52/65, 79%) on mammography and were depicted as non-mass lesions (21/65, 32%) on ultrasound. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the imaging findings might be useful in diagnosing triple-negative breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Gefitinib induces apoptosis and decreases telomerase activity in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.

Gefitinib is an anti-cancer drug that selectively inhibits epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity and induces apoptosis in many cancer cells. Cancer cells are often protected from apoptotic cell death by telomerase, however the gefitinib-induced telomerase inhibition remains unknown. Here we investigated the effects of gefitinib on telomerase activity in two different breast cancer lines, MCF-7 (low expression of EGFR) and MDA-MB-231 (high expression of EGFR). We observed the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation that occurred only MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in media containing 10% FBS. Direct cytotoxicity was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, but not MCF-7 cells when treated with concentrations of gefitinib ranging from 15 to 20 microM. This cytotoxicity was associated with decreased telomerase activity and downregulation of the telomerase subunit, hTERT. c-Myc has previously been shown to activate telomerase activity through transcriptional regulation of hTERT. A decrease in c-myc expression and DNA-binding activity following treatment with gefitinib was observed exclusively in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also demonstrated that gefitinib downregulates the activation of Akt and subsequent hTERT phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicate that gefitinib induces loss of telomerase activity through dephosphorylation of EGFR in MDA-MB-231 cells.</docText>

        <docText>Lasofoxifene for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Lasofoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (estrogen agonist/antagonist) that has completed phase III trials to evaluate safety and efficacy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and for the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women with low or normal bone mineral density (BMD), lasofoxifene increased BMD at the lumbar spine and hip and reduced bone turnover markers compared with placebo. In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, lasofoxifene increased BMD, reduced bone turnover markers, reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, and decreased the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In postmenopausal women with low bone mass, lasofoxifene improved the signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy. Clinical trials show that lasofoxifene is generally well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse events that commonly resolve even with drug continuation. Lasofoxifene has been associated with an increase in the incidence of venous thromboembolic events, hot flushes, muscle spasm, and vaginal bleeding. It is approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture in some countries and is in the regulatory review process in others.</docText>

        <docTitle>High prevalence of PIK3CA/AKT pathway mutations in papillary neoplasms of the breast.</docTitle>
        <docText>High prevalence of PIK3CA/AKT pathway mutations in papillary neoplasms of the breast.

Papillary lesions of the breast have an uncertain relationship to the histogenesis of breast carcinoma, and are thus diagnostically and managerially challenging. Molecular genetic studies have provided evidence that ductal carcinoma in situ and even atypical ductal hyperplasia are precursors of invasive carcinoma. However, papillary lesions have been seldom studied. We screened papillary breast neoplasms for activating point mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, and RAS protein-family members, which are common in invasive ductal carcinomas. DNA extracts were prepared from sections of 89 papillary lesions, including 61 benign papillomas (28 without significant hyperplasia; 33 with moderate to florid hyperplasia), 11 papillomas with atypical ductal hyperplasia, 7 papillomas with carcinoma in situ, and 10 papillary carcinomas. Extracts were screened for PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations using mass spectrometry; cases that were negative were further screened for mutations in AKT2, BRAF, CDK, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing or HPLC assay. A total of 55 of 89 papillary neoplasms harbored mutations (62%), predominantly in AKT1 (E17K, 27 cases) and PIK3CA (exon 20 &gt;exon 9, 27 cases). Papillomas had more mutations in AKT1 (54%) than in PIK3CA (21%), whereas papillomas with hyperplasia had more PIK3CA (42%) than AKT1 (15%) mutations, as did papillomas with atypical ductal hyperplasia (PIK3CA 45%, AKT1 27%, and NRAS 9%). Among seven papillomas with carcinoma in situ, three had AKT1 mutations. The 10 papillary carcinomas showed an overall lower frequency of mutations, including 1 with an AKT1 mutation (in a tumor arising from a papilloma), 1 with an NRAS gene mutation (Q61H), and 2 with PIK3CA mutations (1 overlapping with the NRAS Q61H). These findings indicate that approximately two-thirds of papillomas are driven by mutations in the PI3CA/AKT pathway. Some papillary carcinomas may arise from these lesions, but others may have different molecular origins.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 November 2009; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2009.142.</docText>

        <docText>Estrogen receptor-beta expression in invasive breast cancer in relation to molecular phenotype: results from the Nurses' Health Study.

The expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and related genes has emerged as one of the major determinants of molecular classification of invasive breast cancers. Expression of a second ER, estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta), has not been previously evaluated in a large population-based study. Therefore, we examined ER-beta expression in a large population of women with breast cancer to assess its relationship to molecular categories of invasive breast cancer. We constructed tissue microarrays from paraffin blocks of 3093 breast cancers that developed in women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Tissue microarray sections were immunostained for ER-alpha, progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), cytokeratin 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and with a monoclonal antibody to ER-beta. Cancers were categorized as luminal A (ER-alpha+ and/or PR+ and HER2-); luminal B (ER-alpha+ and/or PR+ and HER2+); HER2 (ER-alpha- and PR- and HER2+); and basal-like (ER-alpha-, PR-, HER2- and EGFR or cytokeratin 5/6+). The relationship between expression of ER-beta and molecular class of invasive breast cancer was analyzed. Overall, 68% of breast carcinomas were ER-beta+. Expression of ER-beta was significantly associated with expression of ER-alpha (P&lt;0.0001) and PR (P&lt;0.0001), and was inversely related to expression of HER2 (P=0.004), CK5/6 (P=0.02) and EGFR (P=0.006). Among 2170 invasive cancers with complete immunophenotypic data, 73% were luminal A, 5% luminal B, 6 % HER2 and 11% basal-like. ER-beta expression was significantly related to molecular category (P&lt;0.0001) and was more common in luminal A (72% of cases) and B (68% of cases) than in HER2 or basal-like types. However, despite their being defined by the absence of ER-alpha expression, 55% of HER2-type and 60% of basal-like cancers showed expression of ER-beta. The role of ER-beta in the development and progression of breast cancers defined by lack of expression of ER-alpha merits further investigation.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 November 2009; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2009.158.</docText>

        <docText>Androgen receptor in breast cancer: expression in estrogen receptor-positive tumors and in estrogen receptor-negative tumors with apocrine differentiation.

Androgens exert growth inhibitory effects on estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines that show androgen receptor expression. These laboratory findings may be translated into inexpensive alternative therapies for hormone receptor-negative invasive breast cancers. Our aim was to systematically evaluate androgen receptor expression by immunohistochemistry in invasive breast cancers. Androgen receptor (clone AR441, Dako) expression was analyzed on 189 well-characterized consecutive invasive breast carcinomas represented with threefold redundancy on tissue microarrays. Androgen receptor expression was semi-quantitated using a histochemical score-like method and a score &gt;10 was considered positive. Of the 189 consecutive invasive breast cancers, 151 (80%) were positive and 38 (20%) were negative for androgen receptor. The majority (95%) of estrogen receptor-positive tumors were also androgen receptor positive. Of the estrogen receptor-negative tumors, androgen receptor reactivity was seen in 3 of 30 (10%) triple-negative cases and in 5/8 (63%) estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative/HER2+ cases. Six of eight estrogen receptor-negative/androgen receptor-positive cases showed apocrine differentiation. Androgen receptor expression in estrogen receptor-positive cases was associated with smaller tumor size (P=0.0001), lower Nottingham grade (P=0.002) and less frequent tumor cell necrosis (P=0.0001). Androgen receptor expression in estrogen receptor-negative tumors was associated with lower Nottingham grade (P=0.005) and apocrine differentiation (P=0.039). In conclusion, most estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors also express androgen receptor. Androgen receptor expression in estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative/HER2+ tumors (which commonly show apocrine differentiation) and a subset of triple - negative apocrine tumors suggest that these tumors together comprises the 'molecular apocrine' group described previously. However, these findings should be further confirmed on larger series of triple-negative and estrogen negative/progesterone negative/HER2+ tumors. Androgen receptor-targeted therapy in estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative tumors may provide an inexpensive alternative to usual high-dose chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 November 2009; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2009.159.</docText>

        <docText>Multistep level sections to detect occult fallopian tube carcinoma in risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomies from women with BRCA mutations: implications for defining an optimal specimen dissection protocol.

Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) significantly lowers the incidence of ovarian, tubal, peritoneal, and breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations. A minority of RRSO specimens from these women will contain occult early-stage carcinoma. Most occult cancer is localized in the fallopian tube fimbriae and is as small as 1 mm in size. Pathologic detection is dependent on thoroughness of tissue examination. Recommended protocols to maximize tumor detection emphasize the role of thinly slicing the tubes and ovaries and embedding the entire specimen for microscopic examination. Additional multistep level sections of tubal fimbriae tissue blocks could theoretically increase detection of occult tubal carcinoma but the value of level sections has not been formally evaluated. This study tests the diagnostic utility of multistep level sections in RRSO specimens from 102 women with BRCA germline mutations. The original diagnoses were based on a single section from each block of thinly sliced (2 to 3 mm intervals) tissues of the entire RRSO specimen. Three multistep level sections were retrospectively obtained from each block containing tubal fimbriae. Clinically occult carcinoma ranging in size from 1 to 13 mm was initially detected in 11 of 102 women (5 in tubal fimbriae only, 1 in tubal isthmus only, 2 in fimbriae and ovary, and 3 in ovary only). Diagnoses in the original fimbrial slides and their level sections were concordant in all cases. All tubal cancers were detected in both the original sections and in the multistep level sections. None of the tubal carcinomas that were noninvasive on the original slides showed invasive growth on additional level sections. No tubal carcinoma was identified in the level sections of any case originally classified as benign. Clinical follow-up among women with benign RRSO findings revealed that 2 women subsequently developed peritoneal carcinomatosis at 22 and 62 months postoperatively. Retrospective exhaustive multistep level sectioning of all remaining tubal and ovarian blocks from both these women confirmed the original benign diagnosis in 1 woman but in the other woman, the deepest levels of 1 ovarian block revealed a single 1-mm nodule of cancer at the base of an ovarian surface epithelial invagination. This specimen was one of the first RRSO cases in our experience and on review of the original report, this ovary was not dissected into multiple slices along its short axis but was only bivalved along its long axis. We propose that there does not seem to be any diagnostic value in automatically performing multistep deeper level sections of RRSO specimens if the tissue is sectioned appropriately and if the specimen is sliced at intervals that are no more than 3 mm thick. Guidelines for evaluation of RRSO specimens should emphasize the use of an optimal dissection protocol and the importance of thin tissue slice intervals.</docText>

        <docText>Genome-Wide Dynamics of Chromatin Binding of Estrogen Receptors {alpha} and {beta}: Mutual Restriction and Competitive Site Selection.

Estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, exert profound effects on the gene expression and biological response programs of their target cells. Herein, we explore the dynamic interplay between these two receptors in their selection of chromatin binding sites when present separately or together in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Treatment of cells (containing ERalpha only, ERbeta only, or ERalpha and ERbeta) with estradiol or ER subtype-selective ligands was followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with a custom-designed tiling array for ER binding sites across the genome to examine the effects of ligand-occupied and unoccupied ERalpha and ERbeta on chromatin binding. There was substantial overlap in binding sites for these estradiol-liganded nuclear receptors when present alone, but many fewer sites were shared when both ERs were present. Each ER restricted the binding site occupancy of the other, with ERalpha generally being dominant. Binding sites of both receptors were highly enriched in estrogen response element motifs, but when both ERs were present, ERalpha displaced ERbeta, shifting it into new sites less enriched in estrogen response elements. Binding regions of the two ERs also showed differences in their enrichments for other transcription factor binding motifs. Studies with ER subtype-specific ligands revealed that it was the liganded subtype that principally determined the spectrum of chromatin binding. These findings highlight the dynamic interplay between the two ERs in their selection of chromatin binding sites, with competition, restriction, and site shifting having important implications for the regulation of gene expression by these two nuclear receptors.</docText>

Activation of plasminogen, the zymogen of the primary thrombolytic enzyme, plasmin, is markedly promoted when plasminogen is bound to cell surfaces, arming cells with the broad spectrum proteolytic activity of plasmin. In addition to its role in thrombolysis, cell surface plasmin facilitates a wide array of physiological and pathological processes. Carboxypeptidase B-sensitive plasminogen binding sites promote plasminogen activation on eukaryotic cells. However, no integral membrane plasminogen receptors exposing carboxyl terminal basic residues on cell surfaces have been identified. Here we utilize the exquisite sensitivity of multidimensional protein identification technology and an inducible progenitor cell line to identify a novel differentiation-induced integral membrane plasminogen receptor that exposes a C-terminal lysine on the cell surface, Plg-R(KT) (C9orf46 homolog). Plg-R(KT) was highly co-localized on the cell surface with the urokinase receptor, uPAR. Our data suggest that Plg-R(KT) also interacts directly with tissue plasminogen activator. Furthermore, Plg-R(KT) markedly promoted cell surface plasminogen activation. Database searching revealed that Plg-R(KT) mRNA is broadly expressed by migratory cell types, including leukocytes, breast cancer, leukemic and neuronal cells. This structurally unique plasminogen receptor, represents a novel control point for regulating cell surface proteolysis.</docText>

        <docText>Circulating Tumor Cells: Evolving Evidence and Future Challenges.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare malignant cells found in the peripheral blood that originate from the primary tumor or metastatic sites. New techniques have been developed to isolate and characterize these cells. CTC enumeration has been incorporated into different fields of oncology as a prognostic marker, a tool to monitor therapy response, and a method to understand basic tumor characteristics. This review covers the different techniques available for isolation of CTCs, the clinical utility of CTCs in breast, prostate, and colon cancer, and future directions in this field.</docText>

        <docText>Long-Term Outcomes in Stage IIIB Breast Cancer Patients Who Achieved Less Than a Pathological Complete Response (&lt;pCR) After Primary Chemotherapy.

Purpose. Pathological complete response (pCR) to primary chemotherapy is the main determinant for improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The primary endpoints of our study were the long-term DFS and OS rates in homogeneously treated stage IIIB breast cancer patients who failed to achieve a pCR (&lt;pCR), in relation to residual tumor burden. The secondary endpoint was the prognostic relevance of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 status. Methods. We analyzed 58 of 74 consecutive stage IIIB patients treated between 1996 and 2001 who achieved &lt;pCR following a primary cisplatin, epirubicin, and vinorelbine regimen for up to six cycles. At the time of patient accrual, trastuzumab was not available. After definitive surgery, pathological residual disease remained in 40 (69%) patients in both the breast and axilla, in 14 (24%) patients in only the breast, and in four (7%) patients in only the axilla. Results. Fifty-eight (78%) of 74 patients achieved &lt;pCR and 16 (22%) had pCR both in the breast and axilla. After a median follow-up of 99 months (range, 72-134 months), in patients with &lt;pCR the estimated 10-year DFS and OS rates were 37.6% and 50.3%, respectively, significantly worse than in the pCR group (p = .003 and p = .008, respectively). Patients with four or more axillary nodes involved had a significantly worse 10-year DFS rate (28.9% versus 62.7%; p = .036). Patients with HR(&amp;minus;) tumors had significantly lower 10-year DFS (17.3% versus 46.4%; p = .018) and OS (17.3% versus 70.2%; p = .002) rates. Overall, the triple-negative (TN) group showed only a marginally significantly worse OS rate (p = .048). HER-2 status alone, in the absence of trastuzumab, did not appear to significantly affect outcomes. Conclusions. Our data suggest that, in stage IIIB patients who achieve &lt;pCR, the number of residual nodes and HR(&amp;minus;) status are strong predictors of poor outcomes. After a long follow-up time, HER-2 expression does not appear to significantly affect DFS and OS. TN patients showed a trend toward early recurrence and death.</docText>

        <docText>'If I feel something wrong, then I will get a mammogram': understanding barriers and facilitators for mammography screening among Chilean women.

Background. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer among women in Chile and in many Latin American countries. Breast cancer screening is an effective strategy to reduce mortality, but it has a very low compliance among Chilean women. Objective. To understand barriers and facilitators for breast cancer screening in a group of Chilean women aged 50-70. Methods. Following the Predisposing, Enabling and Reinforcing (PRECEDE) framework, seven focus groups (N = 48 women) were conducted with women that have had diverse experiences with breast cancer and screening practices. Information was collected using field notes and audio and video recording. Following the grounded theory model, a sequential process of open, axial and selective coding was used for the information analysis. Atlas ti 5.5 software was used for coding and segmenting the data obtained from the interviews. Results. The presence of symptoms and/or the finding of lumps through breast self-examination (BSE) were the main predisposing factors for getting a mammogram. Secrecy, embarrassment and fatalism about breast cancer were significant cultural factors that influenced the decision to seek mammogram screening. Confidence in medical staff and dignity in the treatment at the clinic were important enabling factors. The main reinforcing factors for getting the test were a sense of fulfilment by doing something good for themselves and getting timely information about the results. Conclusions. Primary health care providers should use culturally appropriate strategies to better inform women about the importance of mammography screening and the limitations of BSE for preventing advanced breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Usability of a patient education and motivation tool using heuristic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Computer-mediated educational applications can provide a self-paced, interactive environment to deliver educational content to individuals about their health condition. These programs have been used to deliver health-related information about a variety of topics, including breast cancer screening, asthma management, and injury prevention. We have designed the Patient Education and Motivation Tool (PEMT), an interactive computer-based educational program based on behavioral, cognitive, and humanistic learning theories. The tool is designed to educate users and has three key components: screening, learning, and evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this tutorial is to illustrate a heuristic evaluation using a computer-based patient education program (PEMT) as a case study. The aims were to improve the usability of PEMT through heuristic evaluation of the interface; to report the results of these usability evaluations; to make changes based on the findings of the usability experts; and to describe the benefits and limitations of applying usability evaluations to PEMT. METHODS: PEMT was evaluated by three usability experts using Nielsen's usability heuristics while reviewing the interface to produce a list of heuristic violations with severity ratings. The violations were sorted by heuristic and ordered from most to least severe within each heuristic. RESULTS: A total of 127 violations were identified with a median severity of 3 (range 0 to 4 with 0 = no problem to 4 = catastrophic problem). Results showed 13 violations for visibility (median severity = 2), 38 violations for match between system and real world (median severity = 2), 6 violations for user control and freedom (median severity = 3), 34 violations for consistency and standards (median severity = 2), 11 violations for error severity (median severity = 3), 1 violation for recognition and control (median severity = 3), 7 violations for flexibility and efficiency (median severity = 2), 9 violations for aesthetic and minimalist design (median severity = 2), 4 violations for help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (median severity = 3), and 4 violations for help and documentation (median severity = 4). CONCLUSION: We describe the heuristic evaluation method employed to assess the usability of PEMT, a method which uncovers heuristic violations in the interface design in a quick and efficient manner. Bringing together usability experts and health professionals to evaluate a computer-mediated patient education program can help to identify problems in a timely manner. This makes this method particularly well suited to the iterative design process when developing other computer-mediated health education programs. Heuristic evaluations provided a means to assess the user interface of PEMT.</docText>

        <docText>The effect of symptom clusters on functional status and quality of life in women with breast cancer.

PURPOSE: The purposes of this study of women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy with/without radiation therapy were to determine whether: (1) subgroups of oncology outpatients can be identified based on a specific symptom cluster (i.e., pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, depression); (2) these subgroups differ on outcomes (i.e., functional status, quality of life); (3) subgroup membership changes over time. METHODS: A secondary data analysis using data collected from 112 women at initial chemotherapy. Symptom and outcome measures were completed at three time points: baseline (i.e., the week before cycle two - T1); end of cancer treatment (T2), end of the study (approximately one year after the start of chemotherapy - T3). Cluster analysis identified patient subgroups based on symptom severity scores. RESULTS: At T1 and T2, four patient subgroups were identified: ALL LOW (one or no symptom greater than the cut score), MILD (two symptoms), MODERATE (three or four symptoms), and ALL HIGH (four symptoms). At T3, three subgroups were identified: MILD, MODERATE and ALL HIGH. Subgroups with high severity levels of all four symptoms had poorer functional status and QOL at each time point than other subgroups (p&lt;0.001). Group membership changed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of patients with different symptom experiences were identified. For some patients severity of all four symptoms persisted months after cancer treatment. Initial and ongoing assessment to identify those patients in the ALL HIGH patient subgroup is important so that appropriate interventions to improve functional status and quality of life can be offered.</docText>

        <docText>Breast cancer as a global health concern.

Public health data indicate that the global burden of breast cancer in women, measured by incidence, mortality, and economic costs, is substantial and on the increase. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and more than 410,000 will die from the disease. In low- and middle-income countries (LMCs), the infrastructure and resources for routine screening mammography are often unavailable. In such lower resource settings, breast cancers are commonly diagnosed at late stages, and women may receive inadequate treatment, pain relief, or palliative care. There have been an increasing number of global health initiatives to address breast cancer including efforts by Susan G. Komen for the Cure((c)), the Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and ongoing work by leading oncology societies in different parts of the world. To support such initiatives, and to provide a scientific evidence base for health policy and public health decision making, there is a need for further health services research and program evaluations. Cancer registries can be invaluable in ascertaining the magnitude of cancer disease burden and its distribution in these countries. Additional data are needed for various geographic areas to assess resources required, cost-effectiveness, and humane approaches for preventing or controlling breast cancer in low resource settings in developing countries.</docText>

        <docText>Adjuvant radiotherapy of women with breast cancer - Information, support and side-effects.

The aim of this study was to 1) examine the occurrence and burden of side effects over time in the period after post surgical adjuvant radiotherapy in women with breast cancer and 2) explore the women's experiences of given information and need of support to handle side effects. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 171 women with breast cancer receiving post-surgical adjuvant radiotherapy completed a questionnaire on radiotherapy-related side effects (Treatment Toxicity Assessment Tool OTTAT) at four times between the start of radiotherapy and six months after completion. Comparisons were made between women with breast conservative surgery (group A) and women with modified mastectomy (group B), and for having chemotherapy or not (C+ and C-). Questions regarding the experience of delivered information and support were added. RESULTS: Fatigue was the single most prevalent side effect and, together with skin reactions and pain, it also had the highest mean score over the study period and the largest score increase during treatment. The largest increase during the six months was seen for skin reaction, pain, and dyspnoea. The average score for skin reaction was significantly higher in group B than in group A. A majority of the women experienced the given information and support as satisfying and a need for follow-up of the side-effects was expressed. CONCLUSION: Nursing for women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant radiotherapy should focus on preventing and treating side effects, and also include the period post treatment. There is a need for developing evidence based guidelines including guidelines for follow-up.</docText>

        <docText>The Dachshund gene in development and hormone-responsive tumorigenesis.

The dachshund (dac) gene was initially described as a mutant phenotype in flies featuring extremely short legs relative to their body length. Functioning as a dominant suppressor of the ellipse mutation, a hypermorphic allele of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), the dac gene plays a key role in metazoan development, regulating ocular, limb, brain, and gonadal development. In the Drosophila eye, dac is a key component of the Retinal Determination Gene Network (RDGN) governing the normal initiation of the morphogenetic furrow and thereby eye development. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for human Dachshund homologue (DACH1) in tumorigenesis, in particular, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which DACH1 regulates differentiation and tumorigenesis are discussed herein.</docText>

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a simple and relatively safe technique that emerged as a standard in the management of early breast cancer. Indications are becoming larger and because this particular node provides significant epidemiological, clinical, pathological, educational and prognostic information efforts must be done to identify it even when a a complete axillary clearance is planned.</docText>

        <docText>MRI for the size assessment of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): A prospective study of 33 patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MRI assesses the size of ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) more accurately than mammography, using the histopathological dimension of the surgical specimen as the reference measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center prospective study conducted from March 2007 to July 2008 at the Antoine-Lacassagne Cancer Treatment Center (Nice, France) included 33 patients with a histologically proven DCIS by needle biopsy, who all underwent clinical examination, mammography, and MRI interpreted by an experienced radiologist. All patients underwent surgery at our institution. The greatest dimensions of the DCIS determined by the two imaging modalities were compared with the histopathological dimension ascertained on the surgical specimen. The study was approved by the local Ethical Research Committee and was authorized by the French National Health Agency (AFSSAPS). RESULTS: The mean age of the 33 patients was 59.7 years (+/-10.3). Three patients had a palpable mass at clinical breast examination; 82% underwent conservative surgical therapy rather than radical breast surgery (mastectomy); 6% required repeat surgery. MRI detected 97% of the lesions. Non-mass-like enhancement was noted for 78% of the patients. In over 50% of the cases, distribution of the DCIS was ductal or segmental and the kinetic enhancement curve was persistent. Lesion size was correctly estimated (+/-5mm), under-estimated (&lt;5mm), or over-estimated (&gt;5mm), respectively, by MRI in 60%, 19% and 21% of cases and by mammography in 38%, 31% and 31% (p=0.05). Mean lesion size was 25.6mm at histopathology, 28.1mm at MRI, and 27.2mm on mammography (nonsignificant difference). The correlation coefficient between histopathological measurement and MRI was 0.831 versus 0.674 between histopathology and mammography. The correlation coefficient increased with the nuclear grade of the DCIS on mammography; this coefficient also increased as the mammographic breast density decreased. CONCLUSION: MRI appears to assess the size of DCIS better than mammography by limiting the number of under- and over-estimations compared to histopathology findings.</docText>

        <docText>Feline immunodeficiency virus vector as a tool for preventative strategies against human breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common type of neoplasia in women. Currently 90% cases are sporadic whereas up to 10% are hereditary and likely due to germ-line mutations in specific genes. Eighty percent hereditary breast cancers are associated with inactivation of breast cancer-associated genes (BRCA) type 1 and 2 by sequential mutations. Loss of functionality of one or both genes greatly increases the risk to develop breast cancer and set the basis for the design of strategies to restore BRCA functions or replace the inactive gene(s) before the emergence of the neoplasia. We have produced a lentiviral vector from the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) to transduce wild type BRCA1 into primary mammary cells with a non-functional gene. The system was set up and optimized in tumor cells expressing a truncated gene. Transduced BRCA1 was expressed efficiently and fully functional as demonstrated by the restored ability to repair DNA damages upon exposure of transduced cells to ionizing radiations. This work sets the basis for innovative gene therapy strategies against human breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Overexpression of cell division cycle 7 homolog is associated with gene amplification frequency in breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Overexpression of cell division cycle 7 homolog is associated with gene amplification frequency in breast cancer.

Cell division cycle 7 is a widely expressed protein kinase implicated in cell division, cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms, and cancer progression. To determine the relationship of cell division cycle 7 protein expression with tumor phenotype, molecular features and prognosis, 2197 highly characterized breast carcinomas were analyzed on a tissue microarray. Detectable cell division cycle 7 expression was found in 1088 (57%) of breast cancer specimens and 228 (11.9%) exhibited a moderate or strong expression. High levels of cell division cycle 7 expression were significantly related to medullary histotype (P &lt; .0001); high tumor grade (P &lt; .0001); negative estrogen receptor status (P &lt; .0001); high Ki67 expression level (P &lt; .0001); p53 and p16 overexpression (P &lt; .0001); and amplification of HER2 (P &lt; .0001), c-myc (P &lt; .0001), MDM2 (P = .043), CCND1 (P = .0084), and ESR1 (P = .0012) as well as with the number of amplified genes (P &lt; .0001). There was also a tendency towards worse prognosis in cell division cycle 7 positive as compared to negative breast cancers. The relationship between cell division cycle 7 and number of amplifications was independent from tumor proliferation raising the possibility of a direct influence of cell division cycle 7 expression for amplification development. In conclusion, cell division cycle 7 is a replication associated protein with relationships to gene amplification and genomic instability in breast carcinomas. These data support the potential utility of newly developed small molecule cell division cycle 7 inhibitors as a therapeutic alternative in at least a subset of breast carcinomas.</docText>

        <docText>Invasive ductal breast cancer within a malignant phyllodes tumor: case report and assessment of clonality.

Invasive carcinomas arising within fibroepithelial tumors represent an uncommon manifestation of breast cancer. We report the case of a 70-year-old woman who underwent mastectomy for a malignant phyllodes tumor measuring 6 cm. Histological workup of the specimen revealed a high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma 2.5 cm in diameter within the phyllodes tumor. DNA was isolated from microdissected epithelial and stromal components of the phyllodes tumor as well as from the invasive ductal carcinoma cells. Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, a comparative allelotyping was performed with a panel of 11 microsatellite markers. The malignant stroma of the phyllodes tumor showed loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 16q23, 17q12, 17q25, and 22q13; the epithelial tumor component shared the loss of 16q23; whereas the invasive carcinoma had lost divergent alleles at 16q23, 17q12, and 17q25, indicating a lack of clonality between phyllodes tumor and invasive ductal carcinoma. Although our data are compatible with a previously postulated common origin of epithelial and stromal components of phyllodes tumors, the coexisting invasive ductal carcinoma appears to represent a true collision tumor.</docText>

        <docText>"Scarless" surgery in the treatment of breast cancer.

So-called "scarless" surgery in the treatment of breast cancer consists of a group of procedures with a double aim: local control of the oncological process and maintaining the body image of the woman by making incisions that will not be visible. This article describes four approach routes for scarless surgery (periareolar, axillary, submammary, lateral chest) in different contexts of the oncological breast disease. The application of these incisions in the conservative treatment of breast cancer requires making a wide subcutaneous dissection over the tumour location, and a local reconstruction with adjacent breast tissue, so as not to deform the breast contour, as well as moving the nipple with its areola, thus avoiding the surgical modification of the other breast to maintain symmetry between both. We describe the use of hidden incisions to perform mastectomies that try to conserve as much skin as possible, together with the nipple, as well the dissection, with the aid of an endoscope of the latissimus dorsi muscle, in the immediate breast reconstruction.</docText>

        <docTitle>Efficacy of dexmethylphenidate for the treatment of fatigue after cancer chemotherapy: a randomized clinical trial.</docTitle>
        <docText>Efficacy of dexmethylphenidate for the treatment of fatigue after cancer chemotherapy: a randomized clinical trial.

Cancer and its treatment can induce subjective and objective evidence of diminished functional capacity encompassing physical fatigue and cognitive impairment. Dexmethylphenidate (D-MPH; the D-isomer of methylphenidate) was evaluated for treatment of chemotherapy-related fatigue and cognitive impairment. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated the potential therapeutic effect and safety of D-MPH in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related fatigue. Change from baseline in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-F) total score at Week 8 was the primary outcome measure. One hundred fifty-four patients (predominantly with breast and ovarian cancers) were randomized and treated. Compared with placebo, D-MPH-treated subjects demonstrated a significant improvement in fatigue symptoms at Week 8 in the FACIT-F (P=0.02) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores (P=0.02), without clinically relevant changes in hemoglobin levels. Cognitive function was not significantly improved. There was a higher rate of study drug-related adverse events (AEs) (48 of 76 [63%] vs. 22 of 78 [28%]) and a higher discontinuation rate because of AEs (8 of 76 [11%] vs. 1 of 78 [1.3%]) in D-MPH-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects. The most commonly reported AEs independent of study drug relationship in D-MPH-treated subjects were headache, nausea, and dry mouth, and in placebo-treated subjects were headache, diarrhea, and insomnia. D-MPH produced significant improvement in fatigue in subjects previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Further studies with D-MPH or other agents to explore treatment response in chemotherapy-associated fatigue should be considered.</docText>

        <docText>AMPK-independent down-regulation of cFLIP and sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by AMPK activators.

The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a TNF superfamily member that is being considered as a new strategy in anticancer therapy because of its ability to induce apoptosis, alone or in combination with other stimuli, in many cancer cells. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis that protects the cell from energy depletion and stress by activating several biochemical pathways that lead to the conservation, as well as generation, of ATP. Here we report that a number of AMPK activators, including the small molecule activator A-769662, markedly sensitize TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, silencing AMPKalpha1 expression with siRNA or over-expression of DN-AMPKalpha1 does not inhibit AICAR, glucose deprivation, phenformin or A-769662-induced sensitization to TRAIL. Furthermore, the expression of constitutively active AMPK subunits does not sensitize resistant breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The cellular FLICE-inhibitory proteins (cFLIP(L) and cFLIP(S)) were significantly down-regulated following exposure to AMPK activators through an AMPK-independent mechanism. Furthermore, in cells over-expressing cFLIP(L), sensitization to TRAIL by AMPK activators was markedly reduced. In summary, our results indicate that AMPK activators facilitate the activation by TRAIL of an apoptotic cell death program through a mechanism independent of AMPK and dependent on the down-regulation of cFLIP levels.</docText>

        <docText>Anti-tumoral activity of imidazoquines, a new class of antimalarials derived from primaquine.

The growth inhibitory activity of imidazoquines, antimalarial imidazolidin-4-ones derived from primaquine, on human cancer cell lines HT-29, Caco-2, and MCF-7 has been evaluated. Primaquine, N-dipeptidyl-primaquine derivatives, and other quinolines have been included in the study for comparison purposes. Primaquine and some of its derivatives were significantly active against the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, so these compounds might represent useful leads targeted at the development of novel specific agents against breast cancer. Conversely, all compounds were generally inactive against HT-29, with only one of the imidazoquines having IC(50) below 50 microM. Activities against the Caco-2 cell line were modest and did not follow any defined trend.</docText>

        <docText>Good reasons to implement quality assurance in nationwide breast cancer screening programs in Croatia and Serbia: Results from a pilot study.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the need for and the possible achievements of a comprehensive QA programme and to look at effects of simple corrective actions on image quality in Croatia and in Serbia. The paper focuses on activities related to the technical and radiological aspects of QA. The methodology consisted of two phases. The aim of the first phase was the initial assessment of mammography practice in terms of image quality, patient dose and equipment performance in selected number of mammography units in Croatia and Serbia. Subsequently, corrective actions were suggested and implemented. Then the same parameters were re-assessed. Most of the suggested corrective actions were simple, low-cost and possible to implement immediately, as these were related to working habits in mammography units, such as film processing and darkroom conditions. It has been demonstrated how simple quantitative assessment of image quality can be used for optimisation purposes. Analysis of image quality parameters as OD, gradient and contrast demonstrated general similarities between mammography practices in Croatia and Serbia. The applied methodology should be expanded to larger number of hospitals and applied on a regular basis.</docText>

        <docText>Colorectal breast carcinoma metastasis diagnosed as an obstructive colonic primary tumor. A case report and review of the literature.

Common sites of colorectal breast carcinoma metastasis are bones, lungs, the central nervous system and the liver. Metastases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are rare and especially involve the stomach rather than the colon. Clinical or radiological features usually cannot differentiate them from a primary colorectal tumor, resulting in inappropriate treatment. In some cases, this lesion suggests multifocal spread of breast cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Colorectal breast cancer metastasis is a rare finding and there is no consensus on the management of these lesions. The present case report describes a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting as an obstructive tumor of the transverse colon.</docText>

        <docText>Selective death of human breast cancer cells by lytic immunoliposomes: Correlation with their HER2 expression level.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin) targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast and ovarian cancers carrying a bad prognosis. Our purpose was to target HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells with pegylated immunoliposomes bearing trastuzumab and containing melittin, which has recently shown anticancer properties. Using a panel of human breast cancer cells with different HER2 expression levels, these immunoliposomes decreased cancer cells viability in a dose-response manner and in correlation to their level of HER2 expression. Specific binding of the immunoliposomes to SKBr3 breast cancer cells was shown by ImageStream-based analysis. The morphological changes observed in the treated cells suggested a cytolytic process. This preclinical approach may suppose an effective strategy for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing tumors, and can support the development of an early phases I-II clinical trial. Trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells (JIMT-1), can also be targeted using this approach.</docText>

        <docText>DNA mismatch repair and the transition to hormone independence in breast and prostate cancer.

The molecular basis for the progression of breast and prostate cancer from hormone dependent to hormone independent disease remains a critical issue in the management of these two cancers. The DNA mismatch repair system is integral to the maintenance of genomic stability and suppression of tumorigenesis. No firm consensus exists regarding the implications of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies in the development of breast or prostate cancer. However, recent studies have reported an association between mismatch repair deficiency and loss of specific hormone receptors, inferring a potential role for mismatch repair deficiency in this transition. An updated review of the experimental data supporting or contradicting the involvement of MMR defects in the development and progression of breast and prostate cancer will be provided with particular emphasis on their implications in the transition to hormone independence.</docText>

        <docText>Conspicuity of microcalcifications on digital screening mammograms using varying degrees of monitor zooming.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: American College of Radiology guidelines suggest that digital screening mammographic images should be viewed at the full resolution at which they were acquired. This slows interpretation speed. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of various levels of zooming on the detection and conspicuity of microcalcifications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six radiologists viewed 40 mammographic images five times in different random orders using five different levels of zooming: full resolution (100%) and 30%, 61%, 88%, and 126% of that size. Thirty-three images contained microcalcifications varying in subtlety, all associated with breast cancer. The clusters were circled. Seven images contained no malignant calcifications but also had randomly placed circles. The radiologists graded the presence or absence and visual conspicuity of any calcifications compared to calcifications in a reference image. They also counted the microcalcifications. RESULTS: The radiologists saw the microcalcifications in 94% of the images at 30% size and in either 99% or 100% of the other tested levels of zooming. Conspicuity ratings were worst for the 30% size and fairly similar for the others. Using the 30% size, two radiologists failed to see the microcalcifications on either the craniocaudal or mediolateral oblique view taken from one patient. Interobserver agreement regarding the number of calcifications was lowest for the 30% images and second lowest for the 100% images. CONCLUSIONS: Images at 30% size should not be relied on alone for systematic scanning for microcalcifications. The other four levels of magnification all performed well enough to warrant further testing.</docText>

        <docText>Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-26 in multiple human cancer tissues and smooth muscle cells.

Background and Objective: Elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been found in multiple carcinoma tissues. MMP-26 is highly expressed in prostate and breast cancer tissues, and promotes the invasion of human prostate cancer cells not only through the cleavage of fibronectin and type IV collagen but also by the activation of pro-MMP-9, a powerful gelatinase. This study was to present a comprehensive protein expression profile of MMP-26 in multiple human cancer tissues. Methods: The protein expression pattern of MMP-26 was examined using immunohistochemistry and multiple-tissue microarray. MMP-26 mRNA expression in coronary artery smooth muscle cells was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The expression of MMP-26 in breast, colon, lung, brain, head and neck, prostate cancer, and melanoma tissues was significantly elevated when compared with parallel normal tissues (P&lt;0.05), while not significantly elevated in kidney cancer, ovarian cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (P&gt;0.05). MMP-26 was also detected to express in gastric, rectal, thyroid, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers. MMP-26 protein was expressed in smooth muscle cells of the prostate and associated blood vessels. MMP-26 mRNA was also detected to express in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Conclusions: MMP-26 expression may be associated with multiple human carcinomas, and it may serve as a molecular marker for the early diagnosis of these carcinomas. MMP-26 may also contribute to smooth muscle function in the human prostate and cardiovascular system.</docText>

        <docText>Comparison of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assessment for Her-2 status in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: The concordance rate between IHC and FISH according to clinical performance is still controversial. We report a prospective study to reflect the concordance between IHC and FISH in Guilin city, People's Republic of China. METHODS: Fifty cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of breast tested by IHC and scored as 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+ by pathologists were further analyzed by FISH using a commercially available double-color probe, and the FISH findings were compared with IHC test results. RESULTS: A total concordance of 82.0% was observed with a Kappa coefficient of 0.640 (P&lt;0.001). A high discordance was observed in 30.0% of the patients with IHC 2+, 7.1% in IHC 3+, 19.2% overall in IHC 0 and 1+. CONCLUSION: The IHC can be used firstly to screen the HER-2 status, and FISH can be used as a supplementary role to IHC and 2+ and some negative cases. And only those cases with Her-2 status of IHC 3+ or FISH positive should be treated with Herceptin.</docText>

        <docText>Why Taranaki women choose to have a mastectomy when suitable for breast conservation treatment.

BACKGROUND: Breast conservation treatment (BCT) rate is recognized as a marker of surgical practice. An historically low BCT rate may reflect the requirement for Taranaki women to travel for adjuvant radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the reasons Taranaki women with breast cancer choose mastectomy or BCT. METHODS: Prospective information, on all women presenting with breast cancer between May 2004 and December 2006, was collected on a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: BCT was offered to 68% (140 of 206), but chosen by only 46% (n = 64) of suitable patients. If radiotherapy had been available locally, 23% (17 of 73) of patients who chose mastectomy would have instead opted for BCT. A quarter of each group of women thought they knew their surgeon's treatment preference and most chose this option. Fear of local recurrence and need for further surgery were significantly more important to those choosing mastectomy over BCT whereas what the surgeon was perceived to prefer was more important to those choosing BCT. CONCLUSION: The rate of BCT in Taranaki is low, despite it being offered by surgeons to the majority of patients.

        <docText>Antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of soy phytoestrogen on 7,12-dimethylbenzalphaanthracene-induced mammary tumors following ovariectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats.

Soy phytoestrogen is often used as hormone replacement therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause in postmenopausal women. Since estrogen has been considered as an important risk factor for the development of breast carcinoma, we need to know whether it is safe for these postmenopausal women with breast cancer to take soy foods that are rich in phytoestrogen. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of soy phytoestrogen on tumor proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in mammary tumors that had already formed in ovariectomized rats. We found that soy phytochemical extraction inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and it demonstrated better antitumor effects than single phytoestrogen. Soy phytochemical extraction also produced surprisingly good antiangiogenic effects, which were evidenced by lower microvascular density, reduced plasma vascular endothelial growth factor, and increased plasma endostatin levels. Our findings suggest that soy phytochemical extraction exerts significant antitumor and antiangiogenic activity in a postmenopausal animal model with breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Modulation of tumorigenesis and estrogen receptor-alpha expression by cell culture condition in a stem cell-derived breast epithelial cell line.

Background information. The common phenotypes of cancer and stem cells suggest that cancers arise from stem cells. Estrogen is one of few most important determinants in breast cancer as shown by several convincing evidence. We have previously reported a human breast epithelial cell type (Type 1 HBEC) with stem cell characteristics and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression. A tumorigenic cell line, M13SV1R2, was developed from this cell type following SV40 large T-antigen transfection and X-ray irradiation. The cell line, however, was not responsive to estrogen for cell growth or tumor development. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that deprivation of growth factors and hormones may change tumorigenicity and estrogen response of this cell line. Results. The M13SV1R2 cells lost its tumorigenicity after culturing in a growth factor/hormone-deprived medium for &lt;10 passages (referred to as R2d cells) concomitant with the expression of two tumor suppressor genes, maspin and alpha-6 integrin. However, these cells acquired estrogen responsiveness in cell growth and tumor development. By immunocytochemistry, western blotting and flow cytometry analysis, estrogen treatment of R2d cells was found to induce many important effects related to breast carcinogenesis, i.e. 1) the emergence of a subpopulation of cells expressing CD44+/high/CD24-/low breast tumor stem cell markers; 2) the induction of EMT; 3) the acquisition of metastatic ability; and 4) the expression of COX-2 through CD44-mediated mechanism. Conclusion. Estrogen responsive cell line with ERalpha and CD44+/CD24-/low expression can be derived from breast epithelial stem cells. The tumorigenicity and estrogen response of these cells could depend on cell culture condition. The findings of this study have implications in regard to the origins of 1) ERalpha-positive breast cancers, 2) CD44+/CD24-/low breast tumor stem cells and 3) metastatic ability of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>p53 and gamma radiation in the normal breast.

PURPOSE: With the increasing use of radiation as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer, the effects of gamma radiation on the remaining normal breast are of increasing importance. The complexities of multiple cellular types within breast tissues and the role of the pleiotropic Tumour Protein 53 (TP53, p53) protein with its downstream transcriptional targets and cellular processes may be central to the effects on residual normal breast tissues. CONCLUSION: While a detailed understanding of p53 protein-mediated responses in normal breast tissues remains elusive, p53 appears to have a pivotal role in the effects of gamma radiation on normal breast epithelium, but not stromal cells, which may account for the differing clinical effects of gamma radiation in women treated for breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>beta1 integrin targeting to enhance radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is mediated by the integrin family and has been known to modify radiation sensitivity and resistance in several cell types, including cancer cells. In particular, beta1 integrin signaling has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers and has been shown to facilitate resistance to radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: In this mini-review, we provide a brief overview of integrin targeting in radiation therapy. We specifically focus on the updated findings of beta1 integrin-mediated signaling pathways after exposure to ionising radiation (IR) using in vitro and in vivo experimental models, which could represent promising therapeutic targets for breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Lapatinib plus letrozole for postmenopausal patients with advanced HER2(+)/HR(+) breast cancer.

Lapatinib is an oral, small-molecule dual inhibitor of human EGF receptor 1 (EGFR/erbB1) and 2 (HER2/erbB2). Lapatinib has recently been approved, in combination with capecitabine, for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients failing trastuzumab therapy. Data from clinical trials are consistently showing the key role of this agent in the management of HER2-positive disease. Moreover, interesting data are suggesting a key role of lapatinib in enhancing endocrine responsiveness and/or restoring endocrine sensitivity in hormone receptor-positive disease. The present article will summarize the main data leading to the clinical development of the combination of lapatinib and the aromatase inhibitor letrozole.</docText>

        <docText>Delayed radiotherapy for breast cancer patients in integrated delivery systems.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with delayed radiotherapy (RT) in older women with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: We studied 541 women age &gt;or=65 years diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in 1990-1994 at 5 integrated healthcare delivery systems and treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT, but not chemotherapy. We examined whether demographic, tumor, or treatment characteristics were associated with RT delays of &gt;8 weeks postsurgery using chi(2) tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-six women (14%) had delayed RT, with a median delay of 14 weeks. Even though they had insurance and access to care, nonwhite and Hispanic women were much more likely than white women to have delayed RT (odds ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7, 10) in multivariable analyses that controlled for demographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: Timely RT should be facilitated through physician and patient education, navigation, and notification programs to improve quality of care. Queues for RT appointments should be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure adequate access. Future research should examine modifiable barriers to RT timeliness and whether delays impact long-term outcomes.</docText>

        <docText>Relationship between plasma progesterone, estradiol and prolactin concentrations and breast cancer in pre and postmenopausal women.

Hormones such as estrogen, progesterone and prolactin are implicated in anumber of ways as possible causes of breast cancer. Throughout women life cycle, breast development and function depend on complex critical interplay of these hormones. The acknowledged gaps in our understanding concerning progesterone, estrogen and prolactin hormones involvement in human breast cancer has exposed the need to conduct this study for better understanding of the role played by these hormones in breast cancer during pre and post menopause status in order to influence prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Ninety women were enrolled, (80%) of them were breast cancer patients and the other (20%) were breast benign lesion patients. At attending King Hussein Medical Center, blood samples were collected and analyzed for plasma estradiol, prolactin and progesterone. Of the 72 breast cancer patients (66.6% and 33.4%), and of the 18 breast benign patients (27.8% and 72.2%) were in menopause and premenopausal, respectively. Of the breast cancer and benign patients groups, 55.6% of each had an association with either high plasma estradiol, prolactin or progesterone concentrations. Of the breast cancer patients that had association with high plasma hormonal concentrations, 47.5% had high plasma estradiol concentrations (155.0+/-36 pg/ml) and 89.5% of these were in menopause. Of the breast benign patients, 60% had high plasma prolactin concentrations (55.2+/-10.6 ng/ml). Menopausal breast cancer is associated with high plasma estradiol concentrations, while premenopausal breast benign were associated high plasma prolactin concentrations which indicate that high plasma estradiol in menopause is arisk factor for breast cancer development while high prolactin in premenopausal is arisk factor for breast benign. Therefore, breast cancer and benign are highly hormonal dependent. Keywords: breast cancer, premenopausal and postmenopausal, plasma hormones.</docText>

        <docText>A twisted kiss: in vitro and in vivo evidence of genetic variation and suppressed transcription of the metastasis-suppressor gene KiSS1 in early breast cancer.

KiSS-1 is ametastasis suppressor gene, its inactivation linked to advanced tumor stage and dismal prognosis. We studied its mutational status ,transcription and protein expression in human cancer cell lines and patients with early breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Tumor tissue DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) of KiSS1 exons III and IV from the human cancer cell lines Hela, Jurkat, A549, W138t, MCF-7 and from formalin-fixed resected breast adenocarcinomas from 50 women were analysed by means of PCR-SSCP, RT-PCR and sequencing. Tumor tissue was stained for KiSS1 protein expression by means of the streptavidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase assay. Presence of KiSS1 mutation, mRNA levels and protein staining were examined for correlations with patient/tumor characteristics. &lt;br /&gt;A transversion in exon IVa replacing cytosine with guanine was identified 242 base pairs from the translation start site (242C&gt;G) in the cell lines MCF-7, A549 and in 5/50 tumors (10%), resulting in substitution of proline by arginine (P81R) and alteration of the protein tertiary structure. As the substitution was present in germ-line DNA in 3/5 breast cancer patients harbouring the polymorphism in their tumor, the incidence of tumour-specific somatic mutation was 4% among the 50 patiens with early breast cancer. Although the P81R substitution was associated with reduced KiSS1 protein immunoreactivity (56% in wild-type tumors versus 20% in KiSS1-variant tumours) and with axillary nodal involvement (55% in wild-type versus 80% in KiSS1-variant tumors), the correlations did not reach statistical significance. KiSS1 mRNA was detected in only 15/48 tumours (31%) and showed no correlation with mutation or protein expression. Twenty-six tumors stained for KiSS1 protein, in contrast to the universal strong staining seen in normal breast parenchyma and placental tissues. At amedian follow-up of 38 months, relapses occurred in 20% of women with non wild-type tumors versus 13% of women with wild-type KiSS1 tumors (p=0.7). Presence of KiSS1 mutation, mRNA levels and protein expression did not have prognostic significance for relapse-free survival.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, altered nucleotide sequence and repression of transcription are two potential mechanisms of suppression of the anti-metastatic effects of KiSS1 in early breast cancer: Confirmation in larger cohorts and study of functional effects of the 242C&gt;G exon IVa mutation are warranted.

        <docText>Hypermethylation of the GSTP1 promoter region in breast cancer is associated with prognostic clinicopathological parameters.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer affecting women and the recent research is focused on identifying new genetic and epigenetic prognostic and predictive factors. Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is abiotransformation enzyme expressed in normal breast epithelial cells which can be epigenetically inactivated in breast cancer. We have shown, that application of nested two-stage methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is asuitable method for analysis of epigenetically silenced GSTP1 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from breast cancer patients. Of 45 breast tumors, 11 (24, 4%) were found to have methylated GSTP 1promoter region. We were able to demonstrate the correlation between the hypermethylation of the GSTP1 promoter region and histological grade of the tumor (p Keywords: breast cancer, prognostic factors, hypermethylation, GSTP1, methylation-specific PCR.</docText>

        <docText>Comparative study of the immunohistochemical expression of metalloproteinases 2, 7and 9between clearly invasive carcinomas and "in situ" trophoblast invasion.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases considered to participate in the transient invasive property of trophoblastic cells during embryo implantation and placentation. The same molecules play an important role in the invasive and metastatic potential of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to compare the immunohistochemical expression of MMP2, 7and 9between clearly invasive carcinomas and "in situ" trophoblast invasion in an effort to illuminate their distinct roles in uncontrolled and controlled invasion. &lt;br /&gt;We performed an immunohistochemical analysis of 45 clearly invasive carcinomas of various organs (colorectal, gastric, breast, pulmonary, renal) and 40 first trimester gestation specimens (before the 9th week of gestation). The markers expression was evaluated semiquantitavely, seperately in cancer parenchymal and gestational trophoblastic cells as well as cancer stromal and decidual cells, according to apercentage scale (0 %, 50% of cells) and according to staining intensity (0, +, ++, +++). &lt;br /&gt;MMP9 was expressed more often in the malignant parenchymal as well as in the malignant stromal component of carcinomas than in the trophoblastic (p=0, 0118) and decidual (p=0,017) component of gestations respectively. Although all carcinomas and almost all gestation specimens stained for MMP2 and MMP7, the immunostaining for both molecules was statistically more extensive and intense in trophoblasts and decidual cells by comparison to cancerous elements.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, although there seems to be adirect link between cancer invasion and MMP9 immunohistochemical expression, the role of MMP2 and MMP7 appears to be more complicated underlining the complexity of the mechanisms involved in cancer spreading.

        <docText>Diagnosing breast cancer using Raman spectroscopy: prospective analysis.

We present the first prospective test of Raman spectroscopy in diagnosing normal, benign, and malignant human breast tissues. Prospective testing of spectral diagnostic algorithms allows clinicians to accurately assess the diagnostic information contained in, and any bias of, the spectroscopic measurement. In previous work, we developed an accurate, internally validated algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis based on analysis of Raman spectra acquired from fresh-frozen in vitro tissue samples. We currently evaluate the performance of this algorithm prospectively on a large ex vivo clinical data set that closely mimics the in vivo environment. Spectroscopic data were collected from freshly excised surgical specimens, and 129 tissue sites from 21 patients were examined. Prospective application of the algorithm to the clinical data set resulted in a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 36%, and a negative predictive value of 99% for distinguishing cancerous from normal and benign tissues. The performance of the algorithm in different patient populations is discussed. Sources of bias in the in vitro calibration and ex vivo prospective data sets, including disease prevalence and disease spectrum, are examined and analytical methods for comparison provided.</docText>

        <docTitle>Estimates of overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer associated with screening mammography.</docTitle>
        <docText>Estimates of overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer associated with screening mammography.

PURPOSE: To estimate the extent of overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer associated with screening in New South Wales, Australia, a population with a well-established mammography screening program which has achieved full geographic coverage. METHODS: We calculated overdiagnosis as the observed annual incidence of invasive breast cancer in NSW in 1999-2001 (a screened population) minus the expected annual incidence in this population at the same time, as a percentage of the expected incidence. We estimated expected incidence without screening in 1999-2001 from the incidence of invasive breast cancer in: (1) women in unscreened age groups (interpolation method); and (2) women in all age groups prior to the implementation of screening (extrapolation method). We then adjusted these estimates for trends in major risk factors for breast cancer that may have coincided with the introduction of mammography screening: increasing obesity, use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and nulliparity. Finally, we adjusted for lead time to produce estimates of expected incidence in 1999-2001. These were compared with the observed incidence in 1999-2001 to calculate overdiagnosis of breast cancer associated with screening. RESULTS: Overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer among 50-69 year NSW women was estimated to be 42 and 30% using the interpolation and extrapolation methods, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer attributable to mammography screening appears to be substantial. Our estimates are similar to recent estimates from other screening programmes. Overdiagnosis merits greater attention in research and in clinical and public health policy making.</docText>

        <docText>Demonstration of anti-tumor activity of oncolytic measles virus strains in a malignant pleural effusion breast cancer model.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of malignant effusions in cancer patients. Pleural effusion indicates incurable disease with limited palliative treatment options and poor outcome. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of measles virus (MV) vaccine strain derivative against malignant pleural effusion in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model of advanced breast cancer. Both systemic intravenous (i.v.) and intrapleural (t.t.) administered virus caused massive infection and syncytia formation in the pleural tumor deposits. Intrapleural administration of 1.5 x 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU) total dose of MV significantly improved median survival by approximately 80% compared to the control animal group. Furthermore, we tested human dendritic cells as carriers for delivery of oncolytic MV infection to breast cancer pleural metastases. Carrier-delivered MV infection prevented accumulation of the pleural exudate and also significantly improved the survival of the treated mice. This is the first demonstration of the therapeutic potential of oncolytic virotherapy against malignant pleural effusions in a pre-clinical model of advanced breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>The cognitive effects of chemotherapy in post-menopausal breast cancer patients: a controlled longitudinal study.

Studies suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer (BC) is associated with cognitive impairment related to attention, memory, and visuospatial functioning. However, other studies have failed to confirm that relationship. We report one of the first longitudinal, controlled studies of cognitive effects of chemotherapy in older post-menopausal women. Sixty-one post-menopausal women with non-metastatic BC were administered neuropsychological tests before adjuvant therapy (Time1), six months after treatment (Time2), and at a final 6-month follow-up (Time3). Thirty women were treated with chemotherapy; thirty-one women who received no chemotherapy were controls. Cognitive domains measured included motor, language, attention/concentration/working memory, visuospatial, and memory (verbal and visual). Time-by-treatment interaction was significant in the motor domain (P = 0.007) with poorer performance in women treated with chemotherapy. For the other domains, scores did not significantly vary over time by group. In post-menopausal women, chemotherapy was not associated with changes in cognitive function in areas reported by BC survivors: attention, memory, and information processing. Motor slowing in women treated with chemotherapy could be secondary to peripheral neuropathy rather than an indication of more general declines in cognitive processing. Future studies should control for the independent effects of slowed motor functioning when looking to study possible chemotherapy related cognitive processing deficits.</docText>

        <docText>Identification and comprehensive characterization of large genomic rearrangements in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

Large genomic rearrangements are estimated to account for approximately 5-10% of all disease-causing mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). We use MRC-Holland Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to screen for such rearrangements in patients with HBOC and as a first step in our genetic testing workflow. The technique was applied to a set of 310 independent patients and detected eight different copy number alterations, corresponding to 2.6% of the studied samples. MLPA was also found to identify point mutations located in probe sequences. As commercial MLPA tests are not suitable for determining the specific breakpoints or for defining the exact extent of rearrangements, we applied a set of different complementary techniques to characterize these genetic alterations with greater precision. Long-range PCR amplification, RNA analysis, SNP-array chips, non-commercial MLPA probes, and FISH analysis were used to fully define the extent and mechanism of each alteration. In BRCA1, six rearrangements were characterized: deletion of E22, duplication of E9-E24, deletion of E16-E23, deletion of E1-E13, deletion of E1-E2 and duplication of E1-E2. In BRCA2, we studied a deletion of E15-E16 and a deletion of E1-E24. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of the nature and underlying molecular causes of these mutational events in the BRCA1/2 genes.</docText>

        <docText>Reductions in use of hormone replacement therapy: effects on Swedish breast cancer incidence trends only seen after several years.

Studies from Western countries have found evidence of a recent decline in breast cancer incidence rates in postmenopausal women, findings which have been hypothesized to reflect a reduced use of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). We examined breast cancer incidence trends in Sweden between 1997 and 2007, a period characterized by a drop in the use of HRT. Incidence trends were assessed using data from three population-based Regional Clinical Registries on breast cancer covering 2/3 of the Swedish population. Information on HRT sales was obtained from national pharmacy data. The prevalence of HRT use in age group 50-59 years decreased from a peak of 36% in 1999 to 27% in 2002 and further to 9% in 2007. Incidence rates of breast cancer in women 50 years and older increased between 1997 and 2003. A significant decrease in incidence between 2003 and 2007 was confined to women 50-59 years of age, the group in which the prevalence of HRT use has been highest and the decrease in use most pronounced. As opposed to the immediate effects reported from the United States and other regions, there was a time lag between the drop in HRT use and clear reductions in breast cancer incidence. This may reflect between country differences with regard to types of HRT used, and the rate, magnitude and pattern of change in use. The present findings give further support to the notion that HRT use is a driver of breast cancer incidence trends on the population level.</docText>

        <docTitle>SLC37A1 Gene expression is up-regulated by epidermal growth factor in breast cancer cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>SLC37A1 Gene expression is up-regulated by epidermal growth factor in breast cancer cells.

Phospholipid biosynthesis exerts an important role in the proliferation of tumor cells; however, the regulation of the proteins involved in this context still remains to be fully evaluated. SLC37A1 protein belongs to a small family of sugar-phosphate/phosphate exchangers. The sequence homology with the bacterial glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (30%) suggests that SLC37A1 might be able to catalyze an exchange of glycerol-3-phosphate against phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate, found in different cellular compartments, is a fundamental substrate in phospholipid biosynthesis. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that epidermal growth factor (EGF) transactivates SLC37A1 promoter sequence and induces SLC37A1 mRNA, and protein expression through the EGFR/MAPK/Fos transduction pathway in ER-negative SkBr3 breast cancer cells. These findings were corroborated by comparable results obtained in ER-positive endometrial Ishikawa tumor cells. Interestingly, we also show that SLC37A1 protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum, hence supporting its possible involvement in phospholipid biosynthesis. On the basis of our data, the up-regulation of SLC37A1 gene expression should be included among the well-known stimulatory action exerted by EGF in breast cancer cells. In addition, further studies are required to provide evidence concerning the potential role of EGF-mediated SLC37A1 induction in breast tumor cells.</docText>

        <docTitle>Code Status Documentation in the Outpatient Electronic Medical Records of Patients with Metastatic Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Code Status Documentation in the Outpatient Electronic Medical Records of Patients with Metastatic Cancer.

BACKGROUND: Advanced care planning (ACP) is considered an essential component of medical care in the United States, especially in patients with incurable diseases. However, little is known about clinical practices in outpatient oncology settings related to discussing end-of-life care and documenting code status preferences in ambulatory medical records. OBJECTIVE: To assess the rate of documentation of code status in the electronic longitudinal medical records (LMR) of patients with metastatic cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 2,498 patients with metastatic solid tumors at an academic cancer center. An electronic patient database and the LMR were queried to identify demographic information, cancer type, number of clinic visits, and documentation of code status. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of adult patients with metastatic prostate, breast, ovarian, bladder kidney, colorectal, non-colorectal gastrointestinal (GI), and lung cancers. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was the percentage of documented code status in the LMR. MAIN RESULTS: Among the 2,498 patients, 20.3% had a documented code status. Code status was designated most frequently in patients with non-colorectal GI (193/609, 31.7%) and lung (179/583, 30.7%) cancers and least frequently in patients with genitourinary malignancies [bladder/kidney (4/89, 4.5%), ovarian (4/93, 4.3%), and prostate (7/365, 1.9%) cancers]. Independent predictors of having documented code status included religious affiliation, cancer type, and a greater number of visits to the cancer center. Younger patients and black patients were less likely to be designated as DNR/DNI. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the incurable nature of metastatic cancer, only a minority of patients had a code status documented in the electronic medical record.</docText>

        <docText>FDG hepatic superscan caused by massive breast cancer invasion.

A 46-year-old woman who was treated in the past for locally advanced breast cancer, presented with signs of acute liver failure. FDG PET revealed a massive hot liver with increased activity without any pathologic FDG uptake elsewhere in the body. Therefore, the term hepatic superscan was chosen because intense diffuse hepatic FDG uptake was seen in combination with a surprisingly low cardiac and in minor degree of low brain uptake, similar to the superscan pattern encountered in conventional skeletal scintigraphy. This very unusual finding was the indicator of extensive hepatic involvement caused by breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Hierarchy structuring for mammography technique by interpretive structural modeling method

Participation in screening mammography is currently desired in Japan because of the increase in breast cancer morbidity. However, the pain and discomfort of mammography is recognized as a significant deterrent for women considering this examination. Thus quick procedures, sufficient experience, and advanced skills are required for radiologic technologists. The aim of this study was to make the point of imaging techniques explicit and to help understand the complicated procedure. We interviewed 3 technologists who were highly skilled in mammography, and 14 factors were retrieved by using brainstorming and the KJ method. We then applied Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to the factors and developed a hierarchical concept structure. The result showed a six-layer hierarchy whose top node was explanation of the entire procedure on mammography. Male technologists were related to as a negative factor. Factors concerned with explanation were at the upper node. We gave attention to X-ray techniques and considerations. The findings will help beginners improve their skills.</docText>

        <docText>Down-Regulation of FXYD3 Expression in Human Lung Cancers. Its Mechanism and Potential Role in Carcinogenesis.

FXYD3 is a FXYD-containing Na,K-ATPase ion channel regulator first identified as a protein overexpressed in murine breast tumors initiated by oncogenic ras or neu. However, our preliminary study revealed that FXYD3 expression was down-regulated in oncogenic KRAS-transduced airway epithelial cells. This contradiction led us to investigate the role of FXYD3 in carcinogenesis of the lung. FXYD3 mRNA and protein levels were lower in most of the lung cancer cell lines than in either the noncancerous lung tissue or airway epithelial cells. Protein levels were also lower in a considerable proportion of primary lung cancers than in nontumoral airway epithelia; FXYD3 expression levels decreased in parallel with the dedifferentiation process. Also, a somatic point mutation, g55c (D19H), was found in one cell line. Forced expression of the wild-type FXYD3, but not the mutant, restored the well-demarcated distribution of cortical actin in cancer cells that had lost FXYD3 expression, suggesting FXYD3 plays a role in the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity. However, no association between FXYD3 expression and its promoter's methylation status was observed. Therefore, inactivation of FXYD3 through a gene mutation or unknown mechanism could be one cause of the atypical shapes of cancer cells and play a potential role in the progression of lung cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Are women getting relevant information about mammography screening for an informed consent: a critical appraisal of information brochures used for screening invitation in Germany, Italy, Spain and France.

BACKGROUND: The aim was to find out if information brochures on mammography screening in Germany, Italy, Spain and France contain more information to facilitate informed consent than in similar studies carried out over the last few years in Sweden, Canada, USA and the UK, countries with different medical cultures. METHODS: We generated a list of essential information items on mammography screening for the purpose of informed consent. We mostly used the same items of information as had been used in previous studies and analysed the information brochures of major national initiatives in Germany and France, and three brochures each from regionalized programmes in Italy and Spain. We cross-checked which of our items were covered in the brochures and if correct numbers were given. RESULTS: We found that the information brochures contained only about half of the information items we defined. Six of the eight brochures mentioned the reduction in breast-cancer fatalities. Four of the eight provided information on false positives, and four of the brochures highlighted the side-effects of radiation. The information on side-effects and risks provided by the brochures was generally of poor quality, and none of them referred to over diagnosis. When numbers were given, they were only indicated in terms of relative numbers. CONCLUSION: The information brochures currently being used in Germany, Italy, Spain and France are no better than the brochures analysed some years ago. Our results suggest that the providers of mammography screening programmes continue to conceal information from women that is essential when making an informed decision.</docText>

        <docText>Alternative Splicing and Molecular Characterization of Splice Site Variants: BRCA1 c.591C&gt;T as a Case Study.

BACKGROUND: Deleterious mutations in BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset; MIM 113705) increase human breast and ovarian cancer [HB(O)C] risk; however, many variants cannot be readily classified as deleterious or neutral. Unclassified variants (UVs) pose serious problems in genetic counseling. RNA-splicing analysis is essential for the assessment of many UVs. METHODS: Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to genotype the BRCA1 c.591C&gt;T variant in 685 index cases of HB(O)C families, 326 sporadic breast cancer cases, and 450 healthy controls from Spain. In silico tools were used to predict the effect of the c.591C&gt;T variant on splicing. In vitro splicing analysis was performed in 7 c.591C&gt;T carriers and 10 noncarriers. cDNAs were PCR-amplified with primers designed to detect BRCA1 alternative splicing isoforms. The products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Peak areas were used to quantify the relative abundance of each isoform. Sequencing through exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) enabled us to discriminate wild-type and variant transcripts. RESULTS: c.591C&gt;T was detected in HB(O)C cases (1.5%), breast cancer cases (0.3%), and controls (0.9%). c.591C&gt;T induced BRCA1 exon 9 skipping and modified the relative expression of Delta(9,10), Delta(9,10,11B), Delta11B, and full-length isoforms. The mean ratio of Delta(9,10) to the full-length isoform increased from 0.25 in noncarriers to 1.5 in carriers. The mean Delta(9,10,11B)/Delta11B ratio increased from 0.2 to 4. Overall expression levels of c.591C&gt;T and wild-type alleles were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a nonpathogenic role for the BRCA1 c.591C&gt;T variant. Naturally occurring alternative splicing isoforms need to be considered when assessing the role of BRCA1 UVs on splicing.</docText>

        <docText>How cancer survivors experience their changed body encountering others.

BACKGROUND: Psychosocial cancer research illustrates how women treated for breast cancer experience physical changes in their bodies and the way they perceive, that, others see their body. But how patients with other types of cancer have experienced changes in their bodies and how this affects their relationship with others is less researched. OBJECTIVES: To explore how cancer survivors with different types of cancer and cancer treatment, experience and handle their changed body, especially when meeting others, and how this influences their everyday life of survivorship, i.e. long after treatment has been completed. METHODS: Participant observation at a Cancer Rehabilitation Centre (CRC). Of the observed participants 23 were selected and interviewed twice. RESULTS: Many participants had a changed body due to the cancer and its treatment. When the cancer survivors meet others they experience that their changed body means that they are avoided, looked at in specific ways, or greeted with a specific compliment. The verbal and nonverbal language that the cancer survivors are met with indicates the existence of a specific discursive aesthetic in relation to the disease and the changed body. This discursive aesthetic represents a silence and secrecy about cancer, which makes it impossible for survivors to talk about their experiences with cancer and a changed body. CONCLUSION: The changed body not only represents the physical sign of cancer, it also represents the social presence and representation of cancer. The analysis gives an insight into general questions of meaning related to the changed body in late modernity.</docText>

        <docText>The Portuguese version of the Body Image Scale (BIS) - psychometric properties in a sample of breast cancer patients.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyse the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the body image scale (BIS; Hopwood, P., Fletcher, I., Lee, A., Al Ghazal, S., 2001. A body image scale for use with cancer patients. European Journal of Cancer, 37, 189-197). This is a brief and psychometric robust measure of body image for use with cancer patients, independently of age, cancer type, treatment or stage of the disease and it was developed in collaboration with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Study Group. METHOD: The sample is comprised of 173 Portuguese postoperative breast cancer patients that completed a battery of measures that included the BIS and other scales of body image and quality of life, in order to explore its construct validity. RESULTS: The Portuguese version of BIS confirmed the original unidimensional structure and demonstrated adequate internal consistency, both in the global sample (alpha=.93) as in surgical subgroups (mastectomy=.92 and breast-conserving surgery=.93). Evidence for the construct validity was provided through moderate to largely sized correlations between the BIS and other related measures. In further support of its discriminant validity, significant differences in BIS scores were found between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent breast-conserving surgery, with the former presenting higher scores. Age and time since diagnosis were not associated with BIS scores. CONCLUSIONS: The Portuguese BIS proved to be a reliable and valid measure of body image concerns in a sample of breast cancer patients, allowing a brief and comprehensive assessment, both on clinical and research settings.</docText>

        <docText>An exploratory study of positive life changes in Turkish women diagnosed with breast cancer.

PURPOSE: The present study explored the prevalence of positive changes in Turkish women with breast cancer and the possible relationships between these changes and patient variables such as socio-demographic and illness-related information. It also explored the nature of positive life changes reported by Turkish women with breast cancer. METHODS AND SAMPLE: The study was conducted at Hacettepe University Oncology Hospital in Ankara. Participants were 84 women with breast cancer and open-ended questionnaires eliciting patient narratives were primarily used to collect the data. Socio-demographic and illness characteristics, as well as any positive changes in the participants' life after the breast cancer diagnosis was also collected. For the participants who indicated positive changes a further open-ended question was asked: "Could you write down the positive changes that occurred in your life after being diagnosed with breast cancer?". Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data gathered from the participants who mentioned a positive change in their life following the breast cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Positive life changes were reported by 50% (n=42) of the women and these changes were found to increase only with an increase in the patients' educational level. Qualitative analysis of the data indicated four main themes of positive changes: self-perception, empowerment, greater appreciation of life, and changes in interpersonal relations. CONCLUSION: If nurses are aware of positive changes following the illness, they can help their patients to understand, adapt better and cope with their illness.</docText>

        <docText>Pregnancy after breast cancer: The importance of active counselling and planning.

AIM: To investigate the effect of breast cancer, its treatment and counselling on future pregnancy and fertility. METHOD: Three hundred and four women 45 years and younger at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer were identified from one breast unit from 1997 to 2006. A questionnaire was sent to all patients asking about pregnancy, counselling and fertility issues. RESULTS: Of 304 women, 248 were still alive and not lost to follow up. The questionnaire response rate was 66% and the average follow up was 60 months. By questionnaire response, 39 women had wanted children before diagnosis, and 24 still wanted them post treatment, giving a successful pregnancy rate of 75%. Eighteen patients have become pregnant, 4 with more than one pregnancy. 107 patients were specifically counselled about fertility prior to breast cancer treatment. The mortality due to breast cancer was 10% in non-pregnant patients and 6% in patients who became pregnant after breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy after breast cancer does not confer a poor prognosis. A higher rate of pregnancy than expected was found after treatment, possibly due to newer treatments including fertility preservation and also possibly due to the active counselling programme in this unit. Patients should have active counselling about fertility when planning treatment and fertility conservation can then be incorporated into a treatment plan.</docText>

        <docText>Worsened oncologic outcomes for women of lower socio-economic status (SES) treated for locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) in Pakistan.

Two hundred and thirty-seven women, undergoing multimodality treatment for locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), were retrospectively analyzed for age, menopausal status, socio-economic status (SES), tumor size, nodal involvement, tumor grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER, PR) status and tumor stage. Primary purpose was to assess outcomes of these patients treated in a low-income country as defined by the World Bank and using limited-level treatment resources as defined by Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) guidelines. Secondary objectives included correlation of predictive and prognostic features with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5years. Predictors of decreased EFS or OS included lower SES [P=0.05 (95%CI 0.34-1.0) and P=0.1 (CI 0.29-1.14)], larger tumor size [P=0.01 (95%CI 1.06-1.59) and P=0.3 (CI 0.86-1.50)] and positive lymph node status [P=0.04 (95% CI 1.0-1.55) and P&lt;0.0001 (CI 1.37-2.64). In women diagnosed with LABC in Pakistan, patients with lower SES had larger, more aggressive tumors with worsened survival outcomes. Optimal breast cancer care warrants consideration for health care policies that address access to diagnostic and treatment services for financially disadvantaged women.</docText>

        <docText>Colorectal cancer screening in a Spanish population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Public compliance of recommended screening tests is a key element for increasing participation in colorectal cancer screening campaigns. We intended to investigate the use of the recommended screening tests for colorectal cancer detection in a sample of average-risk subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study with random selection of participants. We included 953 average-risk consecutive participants of a colorectal cancer-screening program who fulfilled a questionnaire to determine their previous use of diagnostic procedures for colorectal cancer detection, use with screening intention and use in the recommended intervals. RESULTS: In total 44% individuals were aware of any screening test for colorectal cancer. A recommended test had ever been received by 13%, but in less than 1% the indication was screening. Use of procedures for colorectal cancer detection was scarce compared with those for breast cancer detection (95%) and prostate cancer detection (47%). Use of a recent colorectal cancer procedure was also lower (8%) than a breast cancer (81%) or prostate cancer procedure (28%). CONCLUSION: Use of colorectal cancer screening and compliance of the recommended guidelines seems suboptimal in the Spanish population. Efforts are warranted for increasing colorectal cancer screening in this population.</docText>

        <docText>Physiotherapy management of axillary web syndrome following breast cancer treatment: discussing the use of soft tissue techniques.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Axillary web syndrome (AWS) is becoming increasingly recognised as a sequela of breast cancer treatment. There are currently no formal guidelines on which to base therapy interventions. This case study discusses the physiotherapy management of a patient with AWS, highlighting a soft tissue mobilisation approach. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old hairdresser experienced sudden loss of shoulder movement and development of axillary cords 22 days after mastectomy and axillary dissection. The management included manual therapy, mostly using soft tissue treatment techniques, combined with education and advice. OUTCOMES: Pre-morbid range of movement was achieved within 11 treatments, spread over 3 weeks. The patient returned to full-time employment after the seventh treatment by a physiotherapist, within 2 weeks of starting treatment, progressing to full range of shoulder movement with no cords or pain by 16 weeks post surgery. DISCUSSION: Previous theories on the pathophysiology of AWS may need to be revised. Physiotherapy intervention for these patients may prove beneficial in limiting subsequent shoulder dysfunction. Further research is needed to develop a standardised treatment approach for AWS.</docText>

        <docTitle>A non-catalytic function of the Src family tyrosine kinases controls prolactin-induced Jak2 signaling.</docTitle>
        <docText>A non-catalytic function of the Src family tyrosine kinases controls prolactin-induced Jak2 signaling.

The cytokine prolactin (PRL) plays important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland and it has been implicated in tumorigenesis. The prolactin receptor (PRLR) is devoid of catalytic activity and its mitogenic response is controlled by cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Src (SFK) and Jak families. How PRLR uses these kinases for signaling is not well understood. Previous studies indicated that PRLR-induced Jak2 activation does not require SFK catalytic activity in favor of separate signaling operating on this cellular response. Here we show that, nevertheless, PRLR requires Src-SH2 and -SH3 domains for Jak2 signaling. In W53 lymphoid cells, conditional expression of two c-Src non-catalytic mutants, either SrcK295M/Y527F or SrcK, whose SH3 and SH2 domains are exposed, controls Jak2/Stat5 activation by recruiting Jak2, avoiding its activation by endogenous active SFK. In contrast, the kinase inactive SrcK295M mutant, with inaccessible SH3 and SH2 domains, does not. Furthermore, all three mutants attenuate PRLR-induced Akt and p70S6K activation. Accordingly, PRLR-induced Jak2/Stat5 signaling is inhibited in MCF7 breast cancer cells by Src depletion, expression of SrcK295M/Y527F or active Src harboring an inactive SH2 (SrcR175L) or SH3 domain (SrcW118A). Finally, Jak2/Stat5 pathway is also reduced in Src(-/-) mice mammary glands. We thus conclude that, in addition to Akt and p70S6K, SFK regulate PRLR-induced Jak2 signaling through a kinase-independent mechanism.</docText>

        <docText>Activated protein C enhances cell motility of endothelial cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by intracellular signal transduction.

Activated protein C (APC), an anticoagulant serine protease, has been shown to have non-hemostatic functions related to inflammation, cell survival, and cell migration. In this study we investigate the mechanism by which APC promotes angiogenesis and breast cancer invasion using ex vivo and in vitro methods. When proteolytically active, APC promotes cell motility/invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells. Ex vivo aortic ring assays verify the role of APC in promoting angiogenesis, which was determined to be dependent on EGFR and MMP activation. Given the capacity of APC to promote angiogenesis and the importance of this process in cancer pathology, we investigated whether the mechanisms by which APC promotes angiogenesis can also promote motility and invasion in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Our results indicate that, extracellularly, APC engages EPCR, PAR-1, and EGFR in order to increase the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells. APC activation of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) -2 and/or -9 is necessary but not sufficient to increase invasion, and APC does not utilize the endogenous plasminogen activation system to increase invasion. Intracellularly, APC activates ERK, Akt, and NFkappaB, but not the JNK pathway to promote MDA-MB-231 cell motility. Similar to the hemostatic protease thrombin, APC has the ability to enhance both endothelial cell motility/angiogenesis and breast cancer cell migration.</docText>

        <docTitle>Hes-6, an inhibitor of Hes-1, is regulated by 17beta-estradiol and promotes breast cancer cell proliferation.</docTitle>
        <docText>Hes-6, an inhibitor of Hes-1, is regulated by 17beta-estradiol and promotes breast cancer cell proliferation.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Hes-6 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, and its overexpression has been reported in metastatic cancers of different origins. Hes-6 has been described as an inhibitor of Hes-1 during neuronal development, although its function in cancer is not known. In this study, we investigated the function of Hes-6 in breast cancer and tested the hypothesis that Hes-6 enhances breast cancer cell proliferation and is regulated by estrogen. METHODS: To investigate the function of Hes-6, T47D cells stably expressing Hes-6 were generated by lentiviral transduction, and conversely, siRNA also was used to knock down Hes-6 expression in breast cancer cells. The Hes-6-expressing T47D cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to study effects on tumor growth. RESULTS: We found that Hes-6 expression was significantly higher in the high-grade, estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-negative SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells compared with the ERalpha-positive, non-metastasizing T47D and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, the level of Hes-6 mRNA was 28 times higher in breast cancer samples compared with normal breast samples. In Hes-6-expressing T47D cells, Hes-6 ectopic expression was shown to stimulate cell proliferation in vitro as well as breast tumor growth in xenografts. Moreover, expression of Hes-6 resulted in induction of E2F-1, a crucial target gene for the transcriptional repressor Hes-1. Consistently, silencing of Hes-6 by siRNA resulted in downregulation of E2F-1 expression, whereas estrogen treatment caused induction of Hes-6 and downstream targets hASH-1 and E2F-1 in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together, the data suggest that Hes-6 is a potential oncogene overexpressed in breast cancer, with a tumor-promoting and proliferative function. Furthermore, Hes-6 is a novel estrogen-regulated gene in breast cancer cells. An understanding of the role and regulation of Hes-6 could provide insights into estrogen signaling and endocrine resistance in breast cancer and, hence, could be important for the development of novel anticancer drugs.</docText>

        <docText>A selective eradication of human nonhereditary breast cancer cells by phenanthridine-derived polyADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: PARP-1 (polyADP-ribose polymerase-1) is known to be activated in response to DNA damage, and activated PARP-1 promotes DNA repair. However, a recently disclosed alternative mechanism of PARP-1 activation by phosphorylated externally regulated kinase (ERK) implicates PARP-1 in a vast number of signal-transduction networks in the cell. Here, PARP-1 activation was examined for its possible effects on cell proliferation in both normal and malignant cells. METHODS: In vitro (cell cultures) and in vivo (xenotransplants) experiments were performed. RESULTS: Phenanthridine-derived PARP inhibitors interfered with cell proliferation by causing G2/M arrest in both normal (human epithelial cells MCF10A and mouse embryonic fibroblasts) and human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA231. However, whereas the normal cells were only transiently arrested, G2/M arrest in the malignant breast cancer cells was permanent and was accompanied by a massive cell death. In accordance, treatment with a phenanthridine-derived PARP inhibitor prevented the development of MCF-7 and MDA231 xenotransplants in female nude mice. Quiescent cells (neurons and cardiomyocytes) are not impaired by these PARP inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These results outline a new therapeutic approach for a selective eradication of abundant nonhereditary human breast cancers.</docText>

        <docText>The relationship between tumour size and expression of prognostic markers in benign and malignant canine mammary tumours.

Tumour size is considered one of the most important determinants of clinical staging in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to assess the value of tumour size as an indicator of the differentiation of mammary neoplasias in female dogs. The tumour, nodes metastates (TNM) system, based on primary lesion size, the extent of its dissemination to regional lymph nodes and the presence or absence of distant metastases, was applied to 120 female dogs diagnosed with mammary neoplasias. Paraffin blocks from 38 cases were selected and studied by immunohistochemical staining for prognostic and predictive markers of breast cancer. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was estimated for 110 female dogs. Larger tumours (T3) were mostly malignant and showed lower expression of progesterone receptor and higher expression of cellular proliferation markers. Global survival time was shorter in female dogs with large tumour masses. This study highlights the importance of tumour size as a prognostic indicator of mammary neoplasias in female dogs.</docText>

        <docText>Protein phosphatase 2A subunit gene haplotypes and proliferative breast disease modify breast cancer risk.

BACKGROUND:: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major cellular phosphatase and plays key regulatory roles in growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Women who are diagnosed with benign proliferative breast disease are at increased risk for the subsequent development of breast cancer. METHODS:: The authors evaluated genetic variation of PP2A holoenzyme subunits for their potential contribution to breast cancer risk. A nested case-control investigation was performed on a cohort of women who had a history of benign breast disease. The women were followed for an average of 18 years, and DNA prepared from the original archival benign breast biopsy (1954-1995) was available for 450 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer on follow-up and for 890 of 900 women in a control group who were matched on race, age, and year of entry biopsy. RESULTS:: Single allele-based and haplotype-based tests of association were conducted with assessment of significance by permutation testing. Significant risk and protective haplotypes of the PP2A structural/regulatory subunit A alpha isoform (PPP2R1A) were identified and had odds ratios of 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.1) and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.41-0.76), respectively. These odds ratios remained significant after the analysis was adjusted for multiple comparisons. Women who had both the PPP2R1A risk haplotype and a history of proliferative breast disease had an odds ratio of 2.44 (95% CI, 1.7-3.5) for the subsequent development of breast cancer. The effects of haplotypes for 2 PP2A regulatory subunit genes, PP2 regulatory subunit B alpha isoform (PPP2R2A) and PP2A regulatory subunit B' epsilon isoform (PPP2R5E) on breast cancer risk were nominally significant but did not remain significant after the analysis was adjusted for multiple comparisons.

        <docText>Genomic instability and the selection of treatments for cancer.

A critical link exists between DNA mutation and chromosomal rearrangements (genomic instability) and cancer development. This genomic instability can manifest itself as small changes at the nucleotide level or as gross chromosomal alterations. Mutations in the genes that encode DNA damage response proteins are responsible for a variety of genomic instability syndromes including hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma, Bloom's syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, BRCA-associated breast and ovarian cancers and Fanconi anaemia. Similarly, epigenetic silencing of genes associated with the maintenance of genomic stability have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer. Here, we discuss how different tumours may be classified not only by tumour site but also by the type of underlying genetic instability. This type of classification may assist in the optimization of existing treatment regimens as well as informing the development of new therapeutic approaches.

        <docText>Antiproliferative Activity of Korean Wild Vegetables on Different Human Tumor Cell Lines.

This study was conducted to determine the antiproliferative activity of 24 Korean wild vegetables. The methanol extracts of these wild vegetables were used against lung, breast, colon and gastric cancer cells, and the results were assessed by MTT assay. It was found that at the extract concentration of 400 mgL(-1) 14 plants exercised antiproliferative activity over 80% against the lung cancer cells, one plant among six-against breast cancer cells, and two plants among six-against colon cancer cells, respectively. Eighteen wild vegetables had the hyperplasia inhibition activity against gastric cancer cells over 23.6% at all extract concentrations, however, only six plants had the antiproliferative activity over 80% in 600 mgL(-1). It was found that the extracts from Youngia sonchifolia, Synurus deltoides, Syneilesis palmata, and Cephalonoplos segetum, in concentration of 400 mgL(-1) inhibited the hyperplasia of lung cancer cells over 95% and Angelica gigas-both lung and colon cancer cells over 95%. In conclusion, the studied wild vegetables' methanol extracts possess dose dependent antiproliferative properties, based on their bioactive compounds, mainly polyphenols, but some of them as Hypericum ascyron against lung cancer are not effective and even course harm.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluation of breast cancer service screening programme with a Bayesian approach: mortality analysis in a Finnish region.

Evaluation of long-term effectiveness of population-based breast cancer service screening program in a small geographic area may suffer from self-selection bias and small samples. Under a prospective cohort design with exposed and non-exposed groups classified by whether women attended the screen upon invitation, we proposed a Bayesian acyclic graphic model for correcting self-selection bias with or without incorporation of prior information derived from previous studies with an identical screening program in Sweden by chronological order and applied it to an organized breast cancer service screening program in Pirkanmaa center of Finland. The relative mortality rate of breast cancer was 0.27 (95% CI 0.12-0.61) for the exposed group versus the non-exposed group without adjusting for self-selection bias. With adjustment for selection-bias, the adjusted relative mortality rate without using previous data was 0.76 (95% CI 0.49-1.15), whereas a statistically significant result was achieved [0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.93)] with incorporation of previous information. With the incorporation of external data sources from Sweden in chronological order, adjusted relative mortality rate was 0.67 (0.55-0.80). We demonstrated how to apply a Bayesian acyclic graphic model with self-selection bias adjustment to evaluating an organized but non-randomized breast cancer screening program in a small geographic area with a significant 27% mortality reduction that is consistent with the previous result but more precise. Around 33% mortality was estimated by taking previous randomized controlled data from Sweden.</docText>

        <docText>TNF superfamily gene polymorphism as prognostic factor in early breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Since apoptosis may play a role in the prognosis of breast cancer, the present study analyzed the polymorphisms of apoptosis-related genes and their impact on the survival of 240 patients with early invasive ductal breast cancer. METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor-free tissue or blood, and 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 11 apoptosis-related genes in the apoptosis pathway determined using a Sequenom MassARRAY system. RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 53.4 (range 2.9-205.9) months, 37 relapses and 22 deaths occurred. Among the target polymorphisms, the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 10 gene polymorphism (TNFSF10 rs1131532) in a recessive model of the T allele and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 gene polymorphism (PTGS2 rs5275) in a dominant model of the C allele were associated with survival in a log-rank test. The TT genotype of TNFSF10 (rs1131532) was also significantly correlated with a lower disease-free, distant disease-free, and overall survival in a multivariate analysis (HR = 3.304, 4.757, and 6.459; P = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.009, respectively), while PTGS2 rs5275 was only associated with a higher distant disease-free survival (HR = 0.302; P = 0.041). No clinicopathologic difference was observed according to the genotypes of these two polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The TNFSF10 (rs1131532) polymorphism was identified as a possible prognostic factor of survival in patients with operated invasive breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>The clinical and imaging characteristics of breast cancers in patients with interstitial mammoplasty.

PURPOSE: The aims of this study are to demonstrate the clinical characteristics and various imaging findings of breast cancers in patients with interstitial mammoplasty. METHODS: A total of six patients, who had breast cancer and had received liquid silicone or paraffin injection for augmentation, were included in this study. Mammography, ultrasonography, dynamic breast MRI, and PET/CT were performed for 5, 3, 6, and 2 patients, respectively. The clinical course was reviewed, and the imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated according to the ACR BI-RADS((R)) atlas. RESULTS: The mean maximal diameter of the detected breast cancers on enhanced breast MRI was 5.5 cm (range 4.8-7.1 cm). Although the breast cancers were all of a large size, subjective breast symptoms exhibited in only four of six patients. Mammographic examinations exhibited variable associate findings such as skin thickening, ipsilateral volume increase, and increase densities, but could not demonstrate main breast masses. A few sonographic examinations exhibited masses with associate findings such as skin thickening. On breast MRI, enhancing breast cancers with associate findings were detected in all the patients. On PET-CT, breast cancers and distant metastases were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancers in these patients were detected at the advanced stage. Dynamic breast MRI was useful for detecting breast cancer in these patients. Mammography failed to demonstrate the breast cancer, but cancer detection was facilitated by associated findings: skin thickening, asymmetric volume increase, and increased density.</docText>

        <docText>Influence of additional breast ultrasound on cancer detection in a cohort study for quality assurance in breast diagnosis-analysis of 102,577 diagnostic procedures.

PURPOSE: To determine the value of a breast ultrasound (US) examination in addition to mammography in cases of American College of Radiology (ACR) tissue pattern III and IV in symptomatic women and women at risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort was initiated between 2001 and 2005 with a total of 59,514 patients and 102,744 mammograms. Documentation was available for 102,557 diagnostic procedures. Breast US was indicated in all women with ACR III and IV in addition to a suspicious clinical examination and in cases of masses and focal asymmetries in mammography. RESULTS: In total, 62,006 additional USs were performed, in which 116 mammographically and clinically occult breast cancers were diagnosed (detection rate: 1.9/1,000 examinations), while mammography alone (40,551 examinations) revealed 903 cancers (22.3/1,000). Of all 1,019 breast cancer findings, 12.8% were detected because of the combination of mammography and US. In the group with ACR III/IV, 15.9% of cancers were found by supplemental US compared with mammography alone. CONCLUSION: The addition of US to mammography vs. mammography alone resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in breast cancer detection rate.</docText>

        <docTitle>Pin1 as an anticancer drug target.</docTitle>
        <docText>Pin1 as an anticancer drug target.

Pin1 specifically catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro bonds and plays an important role in many cellular events through the effects of conformational change on the function of its biological substrates, including cell division cycle 25 C (Cdc25C), c-Jun and p53. Pin1 is overexpressed in many human cancer tissues, including breast, prostate and lung cancer. Its expression correlates with cyclin D1 levels, which contribute to cell transformation. Overexpression of Pin1 promotes tumor growth, while inhibition of Pin1 causes tumor cell apoptosis. Pin1 plays an important role in oncogenesis and therefore may serve as an effective anticancer target. Many inhibitors of Pin1 have been discovered, including several classes of designed inhibitors (alkene isosteres, reduced amides, indanyl ketones) and natural products (juglone, pepticinnamin E analogues, PiB and its derivatives obtained from a library screen). Pin1 inhibitors could be used as a novel type of anticancer drug by blocking cell cycle progression. Therefore, Pin1 represents a new diagnostic and therapeutic anticancer drug target.</docText>

        <docText>Epigenetic targeting in breast cancer: Therapeutic impact and future direction.

Breast carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving both genetic and epigenetic changes. Epigenetics is defined as a reversible and heritable change in gene expression that is not accompanied by alteration in gene sequence. DNA methylation and histone modifications are the two major epigenetic changes that influence gene expression in cancer. The interaction between methylation and histone modification is intricately orchestrated by the formation of repressor complexes. Several genes involved in proliferation, antiapoptosis, invasion and metastasis have been shown to be methylated in various malignant and premalignant breast neoplasms. The histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDi) have emerged as an important class of drugs to be used synergistically with other systemic therapies in the treatment of breast cancer. Since epigenetic changes are potentially reversible processes, much effort has been directed toward understanding this mechanism with the goal of finding novel therapies as well as more refined diagnostic and prognostic tools in breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Mothers' Intentions to Teach Adolescent Daughters about Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Activities: The Influence of Self-Efficacy, Response Efficacy, &amp; Personal Responsibility.

The current study examined whether self-efficacy (SE), response efficacy (RE), and personal responsibility (PR) affect mothers' intentions (N=139) to teach their adolescent and pre-adolescent daughters about breast cancer risk reduction measures such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising on a regular basis, and avoiding chemical exposures. Results showed that both SE and RE were related to mothers' intentions to teach their daughters how to maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular exercise behavior, and avoid chemical exposures. However, PR was not related to any behavioral intention. Implications for breast cancer message development for communication campaigns are discussed.</docText>

        <docText>Facilitating Akt clearance via manipulation of Hsp70 activity and levels.

Members of the 70-kDa heat shock family can control and manipulate a host of oncogenic client proteins. This role of Hsp70 in both the folding and degradation of these client proteins makes it a potential drug target for certain forms of cancer. The phenothiazine family of compounds, as well as the flavonoid, myricetin, was recently shown to inhibit Hsp70-ATPase activity, while members of the dihydropyrimidine family stimulated ATPase function. Akt, a major survival kinase, was found to be under the regulation of Hsp70 and when the ATPase activity of Hsp70 was increased or decreased by these compounds, Akt levels respectively followed. Also, increasing Hsp70 levels concurrent with inhibition of its ATPase function synergistically reduced Akt levels to a greater extent than either manipulation alone, providing new insights about client fate decisions. Akt reductions mediated by Hsp70 inhibitors were prevented when Hsp70 expression was silenced with siRNA. Inhibiting Hsp70 ATPase function produced cytotoxic events only in breast cancer cell lines where Akt dysfunction was previously shown, suggesting therapeutic specificity depending on the Hsp70 client profile. Thus increasing Hsp70 levels combined with inhibiting its ATPase function may serve to dramatically reduce Akt levels and facilitate cell death in certain types of cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Daidzein induces MCF-7 breast cancer cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.

BACKGROUND: In order to study the anticancer effects and cellular apoptosis pathways induced by daidzein. Materials and methods: We used the human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line as a model and examined the apoptosis by Hoechst-propidium iodide staining fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our data indicated that daidzein induces antiproliferative effects in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We demonstrated that daidzein-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was initiated by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, we showed that this daidzein-induced ROS generation was accompanied by disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, down-regulation of bcl-2, and up-regulation of bax, which led to the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria into the cytosol, which, in turn, resulted in the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-7, and ultimately in cell death. The induction of the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway was confirmed by pretreatment with pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. CONCLUSION: Accordingly, daidzein could induce breast cancer cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial caspase-dependent cell death pathway.</docText>

        <docText>Assessing HER2 gene amplification as a potential target for therapy in invasive urothelial bladder cancer with a standardized methodology: results in 1005 patients.

BACKGROUND: This study assessed the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) protein expression and its relationship with gene amplification in invasive bladder carcinoma, using the same criteria than for breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 1005 patients, paraffin-embedded tissues of transurethral resection or cystectomy were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), using antibodies against HER2. All samples with a 2+ or 3+ HER2 overexpression were evaluated by FISH. RESULTS: HER2 overexpression was observed in 93 (9.2%) tumors (2+: 42 tumors and 3+: 51 tumors). Using FISH, all HER2 3+ tumors had a gene amplification, whereas no amplification was found in 2+ tumors. Intratumoral heterogeneity was observed in 35% of cases. These tumors showed the same heterogeneous pattern, with adjacent 3+ positive and negative areas by both IHC and FISH. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 5.1% of invasive bladder carcinomas had a HER2 gene amplification. These findings may have clinical implications for the management of patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, as they could be potential candidates for targeted therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Adult height and cancer mortality in Asia: the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration.

BACKGROUND: The observation that taller people experience an increased risk of selected cancers is largely restricted to Caucasian cohorts. These associations may plausibly differ in Asian populations. For the first time, we make direct comparison in the same analyses of the associations between height and a series of malignancies in Australasian (Caucasian) and Asian populations. METHODS: Analyses were based on the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration of 506 648 study participants (408 381 Asia, 98 267 Australasia) drawn from 38 population-based cohort studies. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the relationship between height and cancer rates. RESULTS: A total of 3 272 600 person-years of follow-up gave rise to 7497 cancer deaths (4415 in Asia; 3082 in Australasia). After multiple adjustments and left censoring, taller individuals experienced increased rates of carcinoma of the intestine (men and women); all cancers, liver, lung, breast, 'other' malignancies (all women); and cancers of the prostate and bladder (men). No consistent regional (Asia versus Australasia) or sex differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, taller men and women had an elevated risk of selected malignancies. These associations did not differ appreciably between Asian and Caucasian populations.</docText>

        <docText>Consultation support for rural women with breast cancer: Results of a community-based participatory research study.

OBJECTIVE: This study asked: (1) What do rural women with breast cancer need to make the most out of their major medical appointments? and (2) What can the community resource centers do to best support those needs? METHODS: We interviewed 12 doctors, 12 breast cancer survivors and 10 community agency staff, including those who provide services to Latinos and Native Americans. Interviews generated success factors and barriers related to meeting patient information needs. Examples were categorized into themes. RESULTS: Success factors included making sure patients review high quality educational materials before the visit; and that someone is available to take notes. Doctors felt that a patient list of questions was productive, but some survivors felt doctors did not always respond productively to the list. Respondents did not mention audiorecording unless prompted. Most then endorsed it. CONCLUSION: Educational materials, question lists, and note-takers can help rural women with breast cancer and their doctors achieve their goals during treatment discussions. Audiorecording may be an implicit but not explicit need. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Other cancer resource centers and support agencies should consider offering information, question-listing, and note-taking services. They should assess whether audiorecording is an implicit need in their settings.</docText>

        <docText>Circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and their complex MMP-9/NGAL in breast cancer disease.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) expression is induced in many types of human cancer, while detection of its complex with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is correlated with cancer disease status. We aim to evaluate the serum expression of MMP-9, NGAL and their complex (MMP-9/NGAL) during the diagnostic work-up of women with breast abnormalities and investigate their correlation with disease severity. METHODS: The study included 113 women with non-palpable breast lesions undergoing vacuum-assisted breast biopsy for histological diagnosis, and 30 healthy women, which served as controls. Expression levels of MMP-9, NGAL and their complex MMP-9/NGAL were determined in peripheral blood samples with immunoenzymatic assays. RESULTS: Women with invasive ductal carcinoma exhibited significantly increased levels of MMP-9, NGAL and MMP-9/NGAL compared to healthy controls (MMP-9: p &lt; 0.003, NGAL: p &lt; 0.008 MMP-9/NGAL: p &lt; 0.01). Significant correlations were observed between MMP-9 and NGAL serum levels and breast disease severity score (r = 0.229, p &lt; 0.006 and r = 0.206, p &lt; 0.01, respectively), whereas a non-significant correlation was found for their complex. MMP-9, NGAL and their complex MMP-9/NGAL levels were not correlated with either Body Mass Index (BMI) or age of patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the serum measurement of MMP-9 and NGAL may be useful in non-invasively monitoring breast cancer progression, while supporting their potential role as early biomarkers of breast disease status.</docText>

        <docText>Update on the use of aromatase inhibitors in early-stage breast cancer.

ABSTRACT: Aromatase inhibitors are currently included in the 'optimal' management of early-stage breast cancer. Uncertainty remains, however, as to the most appropriate treatment strategy, particularly for newly diagnosed women as they seek to trade off the cost, toxicities and efficacy of the treatment options. Recent publications provide conflicting advice on the role of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. This review provides updates on the clinical trials of aromatase inhibitors in early breast cancer and tries to provide practical clinical guidance on their optimal use.</docText>

        <docText>Androgens and the breast.

ABSTRACT: Androgens have important physiological effects in women while at the same time they may be implicated in breast cancer pathologies. However, data on the effects of androgens on mammary epithelial proliferation and/or breast cancer incidence are not in full agreement. We performed a literature review evaluating current clinical, genetic and epidemiological data regarding the role of androgens in mammary growth and neoplasia. Epidemiological studies appear to have significant methodological limitations and thus provide inconclusive results. The study of molecular defects involving androgenic pathways in breast cancer is still in its infancy. Clinical and nonhuman primate studies suggest that androgens inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth while conventional estrogen treatment suppresses endogenous androgens. Abundant clinical evidence suggests that androgens normally inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth. Suppression of androgens using conventional estrogen treatment may thus enhance estrogenic breast stimulation and possibly breast cancer risk. Addition of testosterone to the usual hormone therapy regimen may diminish the estrogen/progestin increase in breast cancer risk but the impact of this combined use on mammary gland homeostasis still needs evaluation.</docText>

        <docTitle>Patterns of Surgical Treatment for Women with Breast Cancer in Relation to Age.</docTitle>
        <docText>Patterns of Surgical Treatment for Women with Breast Cancer in Relation to Age.

Although treatment recommendations have been advocated for all women with early breast cancer regardless of age, it is generally accepted that different treatments are preferred based on the age of the patient. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of breast cancer surgery after adjusting for other major prognostic factors in relation to patient age. Data on cancer characteristics and surgical procedures in 31,298 patients with early breast cancer reported to the National Breast Cancer Audit between 1999 and 2006 were used for the study. There was a close association between age and surgical treatment pattern after adjusting for other prognostic factors, including tumor size, histologic grade, number of tumors, lymph node positivity, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and extensive intraduct component. Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) was highest among women aged &lt;/=40 years (OR = 1.140; 95% CI: 1.004-1.293) compared to women aged 51-70 years (reference group). BCS was lowest in women aged &gt;70 years (OR = 0.498, 95% CI: 0.455-0.545). Significantly more women aged &lt;/=50 years underwent more than one operation for breast conservation (20.4-24.8%) compared with women aged &gt;50 years (11.4-17.0%). Women aged &gt;70 years were more likely to receive no surgical treatment, 3.5% versus 1.0-1.3% in all other age groups (&lt;/=40, 41-50 51-70 years). There is an association between patient age and the type of breast cancer surgery for women in Australia and New Zealand. Women age &lt;/=40 years are more likely to undergo BCS despite having adverse histologic features and have more than one procedure to achieve breast conservation. Older women (&gt;70 years) more commonly undergo mastectomy and are more likely to receive no surgical treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Time to First Tumor Progression as Outcome Predictor of a Second Trasuzumab-Based Therapy beyond Progression in HER-2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.

In a previous analysis performed on a cohort of 37 HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients treated with trastuzumab beyond progression, we found that a second trastuzumab-based therapy is associated with a considerable response rate and preserved time to progression as compared with a first trastuzumab-based therapy. In the present study, we extended the analysis to a total of 69 patients treated in four different italian Institutions, also trying to identify clinical predictors of sensitivity to a second trastuzumab-based therapy beyond progression. Efficacy results on the overall population confirmed that a second trastuzumab-based therapy beyond progression is an active regimen (27.5% of responses and 6.5 months of time to progression, respectively). Median time to progression to the first trastuzumab therapy (TTP1) identified two groups of patients with different sensitivity to trastuzumab beyond progression (group A, TTP1 &gt;/= 8 months and group B, TTP1 &lt; 8 months) in terms of time to second progression and post-progression survival (group A versus group B showed respectively a time to second progression of 7.6 versus 4.7 months, p = 0.05, and a post-progression survival of 31.7 months versus 21.8 months, p = 0.04). In the multivariate analysis, only TTP1 was a predictor of time to second progression and post-progression survival. Despite the recent approval of lapatinib plus capecitabine for trastuzumab-progressing patients, it is still reasonable to offer trastuzumab beyond progression to HER-2 positive MBC patients, because these data confirm the potential utility of such a conduct. In the clinic, time to first tumor progression may represent a useful tool to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from trastuzumab beyond progression.</docText>

        <docTitle>Obesity is a Risk Factor for Developing Postoperative Lymphedema in Breast Cancer Patients.</docTitle>
        <docText>Obesity is a Risk Factor for Developing Postoperative Lymphedema in Breast Cancer Patients.

Lymphedema (LE) is a well-known postoperative complication after axillary node dissection (ALND). Although, sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) involves more focused surgery and less disruption of the axilla, early reports show up to 13% of patients experience some symptoms of LE. The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of arm LE in our patients under going SLND with or without an ALND. One hundred and thirty-seven breast cancer patients were treated at a comprehensive cancer center. Prospective measurement of arm volume was carried every 6 months from date of diagnosis. This data base was retrospectively reviewed for tumor stage, treatment, and subjective complaints of LE. Objective LE was defined as a change greater than 200 mL compared with the control arm. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Arm volume changes were measured over 24 months (median follow-up 20 months) in 137 women: 82 stage I, 48 stage II, and 5 stage III; median age 56 years. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 133 patients. All patients underwent SLND for axillary staging and for 52 patients this was the only axillary staging procedure. All node-positive patients (31) and 54 node-negative patients under went an immediate completion ALND, the latter as part of a study protocol. At 24 months, 16 (11.6%) patients were found to have objective LE (&gt;200 mL increase). Patient age, tumor size, number of nodes harvested, or adjuvant chemotherapy was not found to be predictive of LE by univariate analysis. The risk of developing postoperative LE was primarily and significantly related to the patients' BMI (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed patients with a BMI &gt;30 (obese) had an odds ratio of 2.93 (95% CI 1.03-8.31) compared with those with a BMI of &lt;25 of having LE. Symptomatic LE (SLE), as defined by patient complaints was recorded in six of the above 16 patients, no SLE was recorded in patients without objective signs of edema. Univariate subgroup analysis compared the symptomatic to the nonsymptomatic patients and revealed the median number of nodes removed was higher in the symptomatic patients (17 verses 9, p = 0.045); however, these patients had a lower BMI (p = 0.0012). The mean change in arm volume was not significantly different between the groups. SLE occurs in one third of patients with objective arm swelling and most likely is multi-factorial in etiology. Although patients undergoing SLN were recorded as having objective LE, none reported SLE. The development of LE within 2 years of surgery is associated with the patient's BMI and this should be considered in preoperative counseling.</docText>

        <docText>Breast Cancer Prevention: Patient Decision Making and Risk Communication in the High Risk Setting.

The purpose of this study was to investigate prevention decision making among women at high risk for breast cancer, including patient preferences for preventive interventions, patient understanding of disease risk, and patient preferences for risk communication methods, and the corresponding physician understanding of these factors. A prospective interview and survey study was conducted of consecutive new patients seen at a cancer risk and prevention clinic and their physicians. One hundred and forty-six of 217 eligible patients participated and completed all components of the study (67%), and they were seen by a four physicians. Women's preferences for prevention intervention varied widely across women but were stable across time. Physicians were very often unable to predict their patients' preferences for prevention efforts. Patients overestimated their risk of disease, and physicians overestimated the decrease in perceived risk resulting from counseling (p &lt; 0.001). As risk stratification for breast cancer improves, and prevention options become more tolerable, it becomes increasingly important to appropriately counsel women considering such options. This study provides insight into the decision making process of women at high risk for breast cancer and highlights the importance of addressing patient preferences for interventions and risk perception during risk assessment and counseling consultations.</docText>

        <docText>2Am-DNT induces cell death and apoptosis in human cells.

During microbial or mammalian cell metabolism, TNT (2,4,6-tinitrotoluene) is reduced to 2Am-DNT (2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene), 4Am-DNT, or 2,4-diamino-NT (2,4-diaminonitrotoluelne) depending on the specific organism. The metabolite 2Am-DNT is the most common of the TBT biotransformation pathways in bacterial and fungal species studied to date. in the mammalian liver cells, TNT is metabolized to 2Am-DNT by the P450 enzyme system. Apoptosis is rapidly emerging as a relevant endpoint for detecting low-dose toxin exposure. We report in this study that 2Am-DNT treatment of mammalian cells causes cell death by apoptosis. Cell death was assayed by the Trypan Blue method. Apoptotic changes, such as DNA break down, were detected in treated cells by the production of a dark-brown DAB (diaminobenzidine) signal using the Fragel Klenow DNA fragment detection system, by immunohistochemical techniques with fluorescence microscopy, and by using a microplate reader for a single-stranded DNA binding assay. All of these results showed that 2am-DNT is toxic to mammalian cells and induces apoptosis.</docText>

        <docText>Satraplatin: leading the new generation of oral platinum agents.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, JM-216/satraplatin (GPC Biotech, Inc.) has emerged as a novel oral platinum analogue with a better toxicity profile than cisplatin. Since satraplatin is more hydrophobic than cisplatin or oxaliplatin, it appears to demonstrate efficacy in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. The preclinical and clinical evaluation of satraplatin stimulated this review of the pharmacology and clinical trial data of this agent. METHODS: A literature review was conducted in the MEDLINE database from 1985 to present using the keywords 'satraplatin' or 'JM-216'. The abstracts regarding satraplatin reported at the 2007 - 2009 American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings were also reviewed. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Satraplatin has a favorable toxicity profile, and appears to have clinical activity against a variety of malignancies such as breast, prostate and lung cancer. The oral route of administration and the intermittent schedule makes it very convenient for clinical use. Despite this, a FDA-approved indication has not yet been achieved. The only Phase III trial with satraplatin was conducted in pretreated metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), revealing an improvement in progression-free survival but no overall survival benefit. Future development would have to include designing trials in docetaxel-refractory metastatic CRPC, or in other malignancies where cisplatin is of benefit.</docText>

        <docText>Information technology facilitates cost-effectiveness analysis in developing countries: an observational study of breast cancer chemotherapy in taiwan.

Health information technology offers a powerful tool to monitor the performance of a healthcare system. Advances in computer technology and capacity combined with lower start-up costs will allow developing countries to achieve greater impact when they initiate electronic health information systems. We focused on the integrated health information system that was established in Taiwan in conjunction with the launch of the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. We used data from that health information system to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of chemotherapy use among breast cancer patients. We then used this analysis to discuss what policy makers can learn from this type of analysis. We identified a cohort of patients in the NHI Research Database who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 and had received chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumour. We followed these patients for 3 years and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer's perspective. Using the net benefit regression approach, we compared the cost effectiveness of the two most commonly prescribed first-line chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of breast cancer in 2001 in Taiwan. The dependent variable of the regression model was the individual-level net benefit, and the independent variables included a binary variable indicating the choice of chemotherapy regimen, the patients' age, co-morbidity, type of surgery, geographic region and type of treatment facility. We employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches in our net benefit regression analyses. In the Bayesian analysis, we applied non-informative priors to all parameters in the base-case analyses. We then explored the use of informative priors in the sensitivity analysis, using cost-effectiveness data published in the literature to form the prior distributions for the relevant parameters. Over 60% of surgically treated breast cancer patients received either CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil). A comparison of patient characteristics indicated that patients in the CEF group tended to be younger (47.8 vs 49.1 years; p = 0.016), and were significantly more likely to have undergone a mastectomy (84% vs 76%; p &lt; 0.001) and to have been treated in a teaching hospital (26% vs 13%; p &lt; 0.001). We also observed significant variations in geographic region of the location of facilities between treatment groups. On average, CEF was not cost effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer in Taiwan, although analyses stratified by geographic region suggested a wide variation across regions. At a societal willingness to pay (WTP) of new Taiwanese dollar ($NT)1 500 000 ($US80 000), the probability that CEF was more cost effective than CMF was 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 3.9% for the Taipei metropolitan area, and the north, middle and the combined south and east region, respectively; the probability became 0.6%, 0.0%, 1.3% and 54.5%, respectively, at a WTP of $NT5 000 000 ($US270 000). After co-variate adjustments, the probabilities were 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively at a WTP of $NT1 500 000, and were 0.0%, 0.0%, 1.4% and 34.7% at $NT5 000 000. Sensitivity analyses showed that CEF potentially could have been more cost effective than CMF within a reasonable range of societal WTP (i.e. $NT1 000 000-3 000 000 or $US55 000-160 000) had the optimal dosage level for CEF been established for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. A population-based, fully integrated electronic health information system provides useful data to assess the cost effectiveness of competing treatments and interventions in current practice. This research may potentially inform policy makers of modifications that can be instituted to improve the cost effectiveness of a new therapy. However, findings from this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study provided information only on the short-term cost effectiveness (i.e. 3 years) of CEF compared with CMF. It is possible that a future analysis will reach a different conclusion when more years of follow-up data become available.</docText>

        <docText>Antioxidant and Biological Properties of Bioactive Phenolic Compounds from Quercus suber L.

Phenolic compounds, namely, hydrolyzable tannins and low molecular weight phenolic compounds, were isolated and purified from Portuguese cork from Quercus suber L. Some of these compounds were studied to evaluate their antioxidant activity, including free-radical scavenging capacity (DPPH method) and reducing capacity (FRAP method). All compounds tested showed significant antioxidant activity, namely, antiradical and reducing properties. The antiradical capacity seemed to increase with the presence of galloyl groups. Regarding the reducing capacity, this structure-activity relationship was not so clear. These compounds were also studied to evaluate the growth inhibitory effect on the estrogen responsive human breast cancer cell line (ER+) MCF-7 and two other colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29). Generally, all the compounds tested exhibited, after a continuous exposure during a 48 h period, a dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. Relative inhibitory activity was primarily related to the number of phenolic hydroxyl groups (galloyl and HHDP moieties) found in the active structures, with more groups generally conferring increased effects, except for HHDP-di-galloyl-glucose. Mongolicain B showed a greater potential to inhibit the growth of the three cell lines tested, identical to the effect observed with castalagin. Since these compounds are structurally related with each other, this activity might be based within the C-glycosidic ellagitannin moiety.</docText>

        <docText>Serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF binding protein-3 in relation to breast cancer among Hispanic and white, non-Hispanic women in the US Southwest.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) have been positively associated with breast cancer, especially among premenopausal women. Hispanic women have lower levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 than non-Hispanic white (NHW) women, although no studies have adequately assessed the relationship among IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and breast cancer in Hispanic women. We investigated the association among IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and breast cancer within a subset of participants (n = 184 cases, 522 controls) of a population-based case-control study of women living in the U.S. Southwest. Serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured in fasting blood samples, and associations among IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and breast cancer were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, study center, ethnicity, education, recent hormone exposure, body mass index, parity, total energy expenditure, total calories, and cholesterol. Both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were statistically significantly associated with breast cancer overall (highest vs. lowest quartile (Q4 vs. Q1) for IGF-1: odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-3.43); for IGFBP-3: OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.63-5.67). Positive associations were observed for both premenopausal breast cancer and postmenopausal breast cancer. IGF-1 was associated with breast cancer in NHW women (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.36-5.83), but not in Hispanic women (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.29-2.27). IGFBP-3 was associated with breast cancer in both ethnic groups (Q4 vs. Q1 for NHW: OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.45-7.60; Q4 vs. Q1 for Hispanics: OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 0.76-6.04). In conclusion, the association between IGF-1 and breast cancer differed by ethnicity, while no ethnic differences were observed in IGFBP-3-associated breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Cytokine levels correlate with immune cell infiltration after anti-VEGF therapy in preclinical mouse models of breast cancer.

The effect of blocking VEGF activity in solid tumors extends beyond inhibition of angiogenesis. However, no studies have compared the effectiveness of mechanistically different anti-VEGF inhibitors with respect to changes in tumor growth and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. In this study we use three distinct breast cancer models, a MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, a 4T1 syngenic model, and a transgenic model using MMTV-PyMT mice, to explore the effects of various anti-VEGF therapies on tumor vasculature, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine levels. Tumor vasculature and immune cell infiltration were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Cytokine levels were evaluated using ELISA and electrochemiluminescence. We found that blocking the activation of VEGF receptor resulted in changes in intra-tumoral cytokine levels, specifically IL-1beta, IL-6 and CXCL1. Modulation of the level these cytokines is important for controlling immune cell infiltration and ultimately tumor growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 with r84 is more effective at controlling tumor growth and inhibiting the infiltration of suppressive immune cells (MDSC, Treg, macrophages) while increasing the mature dendritic cell fraction than other anti-VEGF strategies. In addition, we found that changes in serum IL-1beta and IL-6 levels correlated with response to therapy, identifying two possible biomarkers for assessing the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy in breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Circulating tumour cells are associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism in metastatic breast cancer patients.

Background:Cancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are an independent predictor of survival in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that CTCs are associated with the risk of VTE in MBC patients.Methods:This retrospective study included 290 MBC patients treated in the MD Anderson Cancer Center from January 2004 to December 2007. Circulating tumour cells were detected and enumerated using the CellSearch system before starting new lines of therapy.Results:At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, 25 patients experienced VTE and 53 patients died without experiencing thrombosis. Cumulative incidence of thrombosis at 12 months was 8.5% (95% confidence interval (CI)=5.5%, 12.4%). Patients with CTCs &gt;/=1 and &gt;/=5 had a higher incidence of VTE compared with patients with 0 and &lt;5 CTCs (12-month estimate, 11.7 and 11.6% vs 3 and 6.6%; P=0.006 and P=0.076, respectively). In the multivariate model, patients with CTCs&gt;/=1 had a hazard ratio of VTE of 5.29 (95% CI=1.58, 17.7, P=0.007) compared with patients with no CTCs.Conclusion:These results suggest that CTCs in MBC patients are associated with increased risk of VTE. These patients should be followed up more closely for the risk of VTE.</docText>

        <docTitle>Comparison of Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 Expression by 2 Monoclonal Antibodies in Pulmonary and Nonpulmonary Primary Tumors.</docTitle>
        <docText>Comparison of Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 Expression by 2 Monoclonal Antibodies in Pulmonary and Nonpulmonary Primary Tumors.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a transcription factor that plays a role in the development and physiology of the thyroid and lungs. Expression of TTF-1 is used as a marker of lung and thyroid clinically. Commercially available clones of TTF-1 monoclonal antibodies, 8G7G3/1 and SPT24, have been reported to have different sensitivities for the detection of neoplasms of different origins. Although they are used extensively in daily practice, a comprehensive comparative study of these antibodies in a wide variety of neoplasms is lacking. We examined TTF-1 expression in primary tumors of the lung, prostrate, pancreas, stomach, salivary glands, breast, bladder, colon, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and compared the results obtained with both TTF-1 clones. The SPT24 clone detected more primary lung tumors of all histologic subtypes. Importantly, the SPT24 clone detected a significantly higher number of squamous cell carcinomas and carcinoid tumors of the lung. Among nonpulmonary primary tumors, a significant number of invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (5.1%) was TTF-1 positive. In addition, a small proportion of prostate (1.2%), stomach (0.9%), salivary gland (1.8%), and colon (2.5%) carcinomas were positive with both clones. Of note, both clones stained the same nonpulmonary tumors with similar intensity and distribution. Carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were negative with both clones. In summary, the SPT24 clone detected a higher number of pulmonary non-small cell tumors of all histologic subtypes whereas both clones stained a similar proportion of nonpulmonary tumors.</docText>

        <docText>Capecitabine in the routine treatment of advanced breast cancer: results from a non-interventional observational study in 870 patients.

BACKGROUND: This observational study evaluated patient characteristics, treatment schedule and setting, efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine in routine clinical practice in Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with or ineligible for anthracycline-containing therapy were treated with capecitabine. Data were collected until disease progression or completion of 12 cycles (with long-term follow-up in progression-free patients). RESULTS: 846 of the 870 patients enrolled between 2002 and 2007 were eligible. Capecitabine was administered as monotherapy in 64% (median starting dose 1,070 mg/m(2) bis in diem (b.i.d.)) and combination chemotherapy (typically with vinorelbine or docetaxel) in 36% (median starting dose 987 mg/m(2) b.i.d.). Capecitabine was given as first-line therapy in 35% of patients. Objective response rate was 41% and median progression-free survival was 7.5 months. Good performance status at baseline was a significant predictor of efficacy. The most common non-hematological toxicity was hand-foot syndrome (all grades: 54%; grade 3: 7%). Myelosuppression and alopecia were substantially less common with capecitabine monotherapy than with capecitabine combination regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine, alone or in combination, is a feasible, effective treatment for breast cancer. Our findings in real-life clinical practice compare favorably with results from interventional studies, perhaps reflecting the longer treatment duration possible at more tolerable doses.</docText>

        <docText>Diagnostic profiles and prescribing patterns in everyday anthroposophic medical practice--a prospective multi-centre study.

BACKGROUND: Although anthroposophic medicine has been used for more than 80 years and global interest in complementary treatments is increasing, a comprehensive and long-term description of everyday anthroposophic care is still lacking. Our study aims to evaluate how anthroposophic medicine is practised under everyday conditions. METHODS: A total of 38 primary-care physicians in Germany participated in this prospective, multi-centre observational study. Prescriptions, diagnoses, and non-pharmacological therapies were reported for each consecutive patient. RESULTS: In 2005, 95,116 prescriptions for 32,839 patients (56.2% children, 57.3% female) were recorded. The median duration of consultation depended on physician specialization (general practitioners: 9.5 min; paediatricians: 8.1 min). The most frequent single diagnoses were acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), otitis media, and bronchitis in children; hypertension, breast cancer, and depressive episodes in adult females; and hypertension, URTI, and asthma in adult males. Anthroposophic remedies accounted for 41.8% of all drugs prescribed. The odds ratio (OR) for receiving an anthroposophic remedy was very high for cancer (OR = 4.5; 95% CI: 4.2-4.8) and &gt;1 for dorsopathies (OR = 1.5; CI: 1.3-1.6), otitis media (OR = 1.3; CI: 1.2-1.3), and URTI (OR = 1.1; CI: 1.1-1.2). Of the 5,289 therapeutic procedures prescribed, 27% were anthroposophic. CONCLUSION: A broad range of anthroposophic remedies and non-pharmacological therapies are prescribed for a specific set of diseases in everyday anthroposophic practice. Particularly, patients &lt;60 years received anthroposophic care. Our findings will help in the planning and implementation of further studies.</docText>

        <docText>BRCA1 Regulates Acetylation and Ubiquitination of Estrogen Receptor-{alpha}

Inherited mutations of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 confer a high risk for breast cancer development. The (300)RXKK and (266)KXK motifs have been identified previously as sites for acetylation of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), and (302)K was also found to be a site for BRCA1-mediated mono-ubiquitination of ER-alpha in vitro. Here we show that ER-alpha proteins with single or double lysine mutations of these motifs (including K303R, a cancer-associated mutant) are resistant to inhibition by BRCA1, even though the mutant ER-alpha proteins retain the ability to bind to BRCA1. We also found that BRCA1 overexpression reduced and knockdown increased the level of acetylated wild-type ER-alpha, without changing the total ER-alpha protein level. Increased acetylation of ER-alpha due to BRCA1 small interfering RNA was dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and on up-regulation of the coactivator p300. In addition, using an in vitro acetylation assay, we found that in vitro-translated wild-type BRCA1 but not a cancer-associated point mutant (C61G) inhibited p300-mediated acetylation of ER-alpha. Furthermore, BRCA1 overexpression increased the levels of mono-ubiquitinated ER-alpha protein, and a BRCA1 mutant that is defective for ubiquitin ligase activity but retains other BRCA1 functions (I26A) did not ubiquitinate ER-alpha or repress its activity in vivo. Finally, ER-alpha proteins with mutations of the (300)RXKK or (266)KXK motifs showed modest or no BRCA1-induced ubiquitination. We propose a model in which BRCA1 represses ER-alpha activity, in part, by regulating the relative degree of acetylation vs. ubiquitination of ER-alpha.</docText>

        <docText>Lipid rafts and caveolin-1 are required for invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation by human breast cancer cells.

Invadopodia are ventral membrane protrusions through which invasive cancer cells degrade the extracellular matrix. They are thought to function in the migration of cancer cells through tissue barriers, which is necessary for cancer invasion and metastasis. Although many protein components of invadopodia have been identified, the organization and the role of membrane lipids in invadopodia are not well understood. In this study, the role of lipid rafts, which are cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains, in the assembly and function of invadopodia in human breast cancer cells was investigated. Lipid rafts are enriched, internalized, and dynamically trafficked at invadopodia sites. Perturbation of lipid raft formation due to depleting or sequestering membrane cholesterol blocked the invadopodia-mediated degradation of the gelatin matrix. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a resident protein of lipid rafts and caveolae, accumulates at invadopodia and colocalizes with the internalized lipid raft membranes. Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a matrix proteinase associated with invadopodia, is localized at lipid raft-enriched membrane fractions and cotrafficked and colocalized with Cav-1 at invadopodia. The small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Cav-1 inhibited the invadopodia-mediated and MT1-MMP-dependent degradation of the gelatin matrix. Furthermore, Cav-1 and MT1-MMP are coexpressed in invasive human breast cancer cell lines that have an ability to form invadopodia. These results indicate that invadopodia are the sites where enrichment and trafficking of lipid rafts occur and that Cav-1 is an essential regulator of MT1-MMP function and invadopodia-mediated breast cancer cell invasion.</docText>

        <docText>Repression of NHE1 expression by PPARgamma activation is a potential new approach for specific inhibition of the growth of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

Ligand-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) inhibits proliferation in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo; however, the downstream targets remain undefined. We report the identification of a peroxisome proliferator response element in the promoter region of the Na(+)/H(+) transporter gene NHE1, the overexpression of which has been associated with carcinogenesis. Exposure of breast cancer cells expressing high levels of PPARgamma to its natural and synthetic agonists resulted in downregulation of NHE1 transcription as well as protein expression. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of activated PPARgamma on tumor colony-forming ability was abrogated on overexpression of NHE1, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing of NHE1 significantly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to growth-inhibitory stimuli. Finally, histopathologic analysis of breast cancer biopsies obtained from patients with type II diabetes treated with the synthetic agonist rosiglitazone showed significant repression of NHE1 in the tumor tissue. These data provide evidence for tumor-selective downregulation of NHE1 by activated PPARgamma in vitro and in pathologic specimens from breast cancer patients and could have potential implications for the judicious use of low doses of PPARgamma ligands in combination chemotherapy regimens for an effective therapeutic response.</docText>

        <docText>Mammary tumor development in dogs is associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Breast cancer is a major contributor to overall morbidity and mortality in women. Several genes predisposing to breast cancer have been identified, but the majority of risk factors remain unknown. Even less is known about the inherited risk factors underlying canine mammary tumors (CMT). Clear breed predispositions exist, with 36% of English springer spaniels (ESS) in Sweden being affected. Here, we evaluate 10 human breast cancer genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ERBB2, FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, RCAS1, TOX3, and TP53) for association with CMTs. Sixty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; four to nine SNPs per gene) were genotyped by iPLEX in female ESS dogs, 212 CMT cases and 143 controls. Two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were significantly associated with CMT (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.005 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Borderline association was seen for FGFR2. Benign and malignant cases were also analyzed separately. Those findings supported the association to BRCA1 and BRCA2 but with a stronger association to BRCA1 in malignant cases. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 showed odds ratios of approximately 4. In conclusion, this study indicates that BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute to the risk of CMT in ESS, suggesting that dogs may serve as a good model for human breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Inhibition of rho-associated kinase signaling prevents breast cancer metastasis to human bone.</docTitle>
        <docText>Inhibition of rho-associated kinase signaling prevents breast cancer metastasis to human bone.

Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling plays a fundamental role in regulating cell morphology, adhesion, and motility. Aberrant expression of ROCK is related to tumor metastases and poor clinical outcome. Here, we show that ROCK expression is increased in metastatic human mammary tumors and breast cancer cell lines compared with nonmetastatic tumors and cell lines. Overexpression of ROCK confers a metastatic phenotype on the nonmetastatic MCF-7 cell line. Inhibition of ROCK activity, by either a specific ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) or ROCK-targeted small interfering RNAs, reduces cell migration and proliferation in vitro and metastasis to bone in vivo using a novel "human breast cancer metastasis to human bone" mouse model. Expression of the c-Myc-regulated miR-17-92 cluster is shown to be elevated in metastatic breast cancer cells compared with nonmetastatic cells and diminished by Y27632 treatment. Furthermore, blockade of miR-17 is shown to decrease breast cancer cell invasion/migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that augmented ROCK signaling contributes to breast cancer metastasis. The effects of ROCK on tumor cell invasion/motility and growth may derive from regulating cytoskeletal actin-myosin contraction and modulating the c-Myc pathway, including c-Myc-dependent microRNAs. Inhibition of ROCK or the pathway it stimulates, therefore, may represent a novel approach for treatment of breast cancer metastases.</docText>

        <docText>Retinoblastoma family proteins have distinct functions in pulmonary epithelial cells in vivo critical for suppressing cell growth and tumorigenesis.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for more deaths than breast, colon, and prostate cancer combined. The retinoblastoma (Rb)/p16 tumor suppressive pathway is deregulated in most cancers. Loss of p16 occurs more frequently than Rb loss, suggesting that p16 suppresses cancer by regulating Rb as well as the related proteins p107 and p130. However, direct evidence demonstrating that p130 or p107 cooperate with Rb to suppress epithelial cancers associated with p16 loss is currently lacking. Moreover, the roles of p130 and p107 in lung cancer are not clear. In the present studies, Rb ablation was targeted to the lung epithelium in wild-type, p107, or p130 null mice to determine unique and overlapping Rb family functions critical in tumor suppression. Rb ablation during development resulted in marked epithelial abnormalities despite p107 upregulation. In contrast, p130 and p107 were not required during development but had distinct functions in the Rb-deficient epithelium: p107 was required to suppress proliferation, whereas a novel proapoptotic function was identified for p130. Adult Rb-ablated lungs lacked the epithelial phenotype seen at birth and showed compensatory p107 upregulation and p16 induction in epithelial cell lineages that share phenotypic characteristics with human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that frequently show p16 loss. Importantly, Rb/p107-deficient, but not Rb/p130-deficient, lungs developed tumors resembling NSCLC. Taken together, these studies identify distinct Rb family functions critical in controlling epithelial cell growth, and provide direct evidence that p107 cooperates with Rb to protect against a common adult cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Inhibition of lipocalin 2 impairs breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Lipocalin 2 (LCN2; also known as NGAL) is a secreted glycoprotein and its elevated expression has been observed in breast cancers. However, the importance of LCN2 in breast tumorigenesis is unclear. Here, we employed a spontaneous mammary tumor mouse model showing that MMTV-ErbB2(V664E) mice lacking mouse LCN2 had significantly delayed mammary tumor formation and metastasis with reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the blood. LCN2 expression is upregulated by HER2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/NF-kappaB pathway. Decreasing LCN2 expression significantly reduced the invasion and migration ability of HER2(+) breast cancer cells. Furthermore, injecting an anti-mouse LCN2 antibody into mice bearing established murine breast tumors resulted in significant blockage of lung metastasis. Our findings indicate that LCN2 is a critical factor in enhancing breast tumor formation and progression possibly in part by stabilizing matrix metalloproteinase-9. Our results suggest that inhibition of LCN2 function by an inhibitory monoclonal antibody has potential for breast cancer therapy, particularly by interfering with metastasis in aggressive types of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Ubiquitination and downregulation of BRCA1 by ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2T overexpression in human breast cancer cells.

Breast cancer is generated through a multistep genetic and epigenetic process including activations of oncogenes and inactivations of tumor suppressor genes. Here, we report a critical role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2T (UBE2T), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, in mammary carcinogenesis. Immunocytochemical staining and in vitro binding assay revealed that UBE2T interacted and colocalized with the BRCA1/BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1) complex. Knocking down of UBE2T expression with small interfering RNA drastically suppressed the growth of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, in vivo ubiquitination assay indicated BRCA1 to be polyubiquitinated by incubation with wild-type UBE2T protein, but not with C86A-UBE2T protein, an E2 activity-dead mutant, in which the 86th residue of cysteine was replaced with alanine. Furthermore, knocking down of UBE2T protein induced upregulation of BRCA1 protein in breast cancer cells, whereas its overexpression caused the decrease of the BRCA1 protein. Our data imply a critical role of UBE2T in development and/or progression of breast cancer through the interaction with and the regulation of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex.</docText>

        <docText>Beta1-integrin circumvents the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive breast cancer.

Resistance to trastuzumab, the monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), is a major concern for HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. To date, HER-2 status is the only available biomarker for selecting patients for trastuzumab-based therapy. Beta(1)-integrin, an adhesion molecule involved in cell survival and drug resistance, shares common downstream signaling elements with HER-2, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways. The significance of beta(1)-integrin expression in HER-2-positive breast cancer and its involvement in a patient's response to trastuzumab-based therapy are unknown. We show here that overexpression of beta(1)-integrin is an independent negative prognostic factor for tumor progression of HER-2-positive MBC patients treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. Enforced overexpression of beta(1)-integrin, its small interfering RNA-induced knockdown or treatment with a beta(1)-integrin-blocking antibody in HER-2-positive breast cancer cells, identified a strong inverse relationship between expression level of beta(1)-integrin and in vitro sensitivity to trastuzumab. Notably, beta(1)-integrin overexpression increased the phosphorylation of Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2, thereby promoting survival and mitogenic signals to bypass the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab. Our findings show that beta(1)-integrin provides a novel independent prognostic biomarker of trastuzumab response in HER-2-positive MBC patients and suggest a new target to augment the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab.</docText>

        <docTitle>Involvement of the HER2 pathway in repair of DNA damage produced by chemotherapeutic agents.</docTitle>
        <docText>Involvement of the HER2 pathway in repair of DNA damage produced by chemotherapeutic agents.

HER2 (ErbB2) is overexpressed in up to 30% of human breast cancers. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest synergy between some chemotherapeutic agents and the humanized anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). This study investigated the effects of etoposide and cisplatin on the repair of DNA damage in breast cancer cell lines. We examined the potential significance of HER2 nuclear expression in DNA repair. MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with cisplatin and etoposide. Repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) and strand breaks, following incubation with cisplatin and etoposide, respectively, were quantitated by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Intrastrand crosslinks produced by cisplatin were assessed by ELISA. The effects of trastuzumab were measured in combination with these drugs. Similar experiments were done using HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with HER2 and a construct lacking the nuclear localization sequence. Incubation of breast cancer cell lines with trastuzumab delayed the repair of ICL produced by cisplatin. There were no effects on the repair of intrastrand crosslinks produced by cisplatin, or repair of DNA strand breaks following etoposide treatment. Transfection of HER2 into MDA-MB-468 cells inhibited the repair of cisplatin-induced ICL, whereas transfection of a HER2 construct lacking the nuclear localization sequence did not affect DNA repair. These results indicate that HER2 expression modulates the repair of specific DNA lesions produced by chemotherapy. The effect on ICL repair requires nuclear expression of HER2. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between DNA-interacting agents and HER2 inhibitors will inform the design of clinical trials and optimize the therapeutic effects of these combinations.</docText>

        <docTitle>Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists inhibit tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists inhibit tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer.

Cannabinoids have been reported to possess antitumorogenic activity. Not much is known, however, about the effects and mechanism of action of synthetic nonpsychotic cannabinoids on breast cancer growth and metastasis. We have shown that the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are overexpressed in primary human breast tumors compared with normal breast tissue. We have also observed that the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231, MDA-MB231-luc, and MDA-MB468 express CB1 and CB2 receptors. Furthermore, we have shown that the CB2 synthetic agonist JWH-133 and the CB1 and CB2 agonist WIN-55,212-2 inhibit cell proliferation and migration under in vitro conditions. These results were confirmed in vivo in various mouse model systems. Mice treated with JWH-133 or WIN-55,212-2 showed a 40% to 50% reduction in tumor growth and a 65% to 80% reduction in lung metastasis. These effects were reversed by CB1 and CB2 antagonists AM 251 and SR144528, respectively, suggesting involvement of CB1 and CB2 receptors. In addition, the CB2 agonist JWH-133 was shown to delay and reduce mammary gland tumors in the polyoma middle T oncoprotein (PyMT) transgenic mouse model system. Upon further elucidation, we observed that JWH-133 and WIN-55,212-2 mediate the breast tumor-suppressive effects via a coordinated regulation of cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 signaling pathways and induction of apoptosis. These results indicate that CB1 and CB2 receptors could be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies against breast cancer growth and metastasis.</docText>

        <docTitle>Experimental cancer therapy using restoration of NAD+ -linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase expression.</docTitle>
        <docText>Experimental cancer therapy using restoration of NAD+ -linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase expression.

Preclinical and clinical evidence shows that cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-mediated prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) overexpression plays an important role in tumor growth, metastasis, and immunosuppression. It has been shown that expression of NAD(+)-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), a key enzyme responsible for PGE(2) inactivation, is suppressed in the majority of cancers, including breast and colon carcinoma. We have developed adenoviral vectors (Ad) encoding the 15-PGDH gene under control of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1/flt-1; Adflt-PGDH) and the Cox-2 (Adcox-PGDH) promoters. The purpose of this study was to investigate cytotoxicity in vitro and therapeutic efficacy in vivo of 15-PGDH-mediated cancer therapy. The levels of PGE(2) and VEGF expression were correlated with PGE(2) receptor and Cox-2 and flt-1 expression in cancer cells. The in vitro study showed that Ad-mediated 15-PGDH expression significantly decreased proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Animal breast and colon tumor therapy studies showed that 15-PGDH gene therapy produced a significant delay in 2LMP and LS174T tumor growth. Combined therapy using 15-PGDH and anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) significantly increased inhibition of growth of LS174T tumor xenografts in comparison with agents alone. These results suggest that 15-PGDH-mediated regulation of PGE(2) catabolism in the tumor microenvironment represents a novel approach for therapy of human breast and colon cancer.</docText>

        <docText>A phase I trial of paclitaxel and trastuzumab in combination with interleukin-12 in patients with HER2/neu-expressing malignancies.

Our preclinical work showed a dramatic synergy between interleukin-12 (IL-12) and trastuzumab for stimulation of natural killer cell cytokine secretion. We aimed to determine the safety profile of IL-12 when given in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel to patients with metastatic HER2-overexpressing cancers. Paclitaxel was given i.v. at 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Trastuzumab was given on day 1 each week (4 mg/kg initially and 2 mg/kg thereafter) in combination with injections of IL-12 on days 2 and 5 starting in cycle 2. This trial accrued 21 patients with metastatic HER2-positive tumors (breast, 7; colon, 6; esophagus, 4; stomach, 2; pancreas, 1; thyroid, 1). The IL-12 component was dose-escalated in cohorts of three patients. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue at the 300 ng/kg dose level in two patients. The recommended phase II dose was 200 ng/kg administered s.c. There was one complete response in a patient with breast cancer, partial responses in 4 patients (breast, 2; esophageal, 2), and stabilization of disease lasting 3 months or greater (SD) in 6 other patients. All but one response occurred in patients with HER2 3+ disease. Two SD patients completed 1 year of therapy. Ten patients had progressive disease. There was increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased levels of IFN-gamma and several chemokines in patients with clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or SD), but not in patients with progressive disease. IL-12 in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel therefore exhibits an acceptable toxicity profile and has activity in patients with HER2-overexpressing cancers.</docText>

        <docTitle>Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma: Clinicopathologic Features and Prognostic Value of Triple Negativity.</docTitle>
        <docText>Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma: Clinicopathologic Features and Prognostic Value of Triple Negativity.

OBJECTIVE: Metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBC) are a rare type of breast cancer and are generally characterized by hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity. There is a paucity of information on prognosis according to hormone receptor and HER2 expression for these rare tumors. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical features and prognosis between triple-negative metaplastic carcinoma (TNMC) and non-triple-negative metaplastic carcinoma (NTNMC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed MBC patients treated at Seoul National University Hospital between 1996 and 2006. The medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were identified. At a median follow-up of 40.8 months, the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 75.5% and 86.3%, respectively. Non-triple negativity (P = 0.012) correlated significantly with OS in multivariate analysis. Of the 51 patients, 41 (80.4%) had TNMC and 10 (19.6%) had NTNMC. The two groups did not differ significantly by age, tumor size or nodal status. In patients with NTNMC, the positivity rates for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 were 20.0%, 30.0% and 80.0% in NTNMC. The 3-year OS rates in patients with TNMC and NTNMC were 93.4% and 58.2%, respectively (P = 0.007). With respect to DFS, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with TNMC and those with NTNMC (P = 0.149). CONCLUSIONS: In MBC, the non-triple-negative group had a poor prognosis compared with the triple-negative group, which is contrary to what has been reported in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of breast. Further research exploring the mechanism underlying this result is needed.</docText>

        <docText>Capecitabine Monotherapy is Efficient and Safe in All Line Settings in Patients with Metastatic and Advanced Breast Cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Capecitabine is effective and well tolerated in patients with anthracycline- and/or taxane-pre-treated metastatic breast cancer. We compared the efficacy and safety of capecitabine monotherapy between 1st, 2nd, 3rd and &gt;/=4th line settings for advanced and metastatic breast cancer pre-treated with/without anthracycline and taxanes. METHODS: Subjects comprised 84 patients with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic breast cancer and at least one measurable metastatic lesion. We evaluated time to disease progression (TTP), response rate (RR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) for 1st (n = 17), 2nd (n = 28), 3rd (n = 23) and &gt;/=4th (n = 16) line setting treatments of capecitabine monotherapy. RESULTS: Median number of cycles of capecitabine monotherapy was 12 cycles in 1st line, 11 cycles in 2nd line, 9 cycles in 3rd line and 11 cycles in &gt;/=4th line. RR and CBR were 23.5% and 58.8% in 1st line, 21.4% and 53.6% in 2nd line, 21.7% and 52.2% in 3rd line, and 18.8% and 50.0% in &gt;/=4th line, respectively. No significant differences in TTP were seen between each line setting (P = 0.843). CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine monotherapy is effective and well tolerated in all line settings of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or advanced breast cancer, and is suitable for outpatient therapy.</docText>

        <docTitle>Microarray-based determination of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status in breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Microarray-based determination of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status in breast cancer.

PURPOSE: The level of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 aids in the determination of prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry is currently the predominant method for assessment, but differences in methods and interpretation can substantially affect the accuracy, resulting in misclassification. Here, we investigated the association of microarray-based mRNA expression levels compared with immunohistochemistry. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microarray mRNA quantification of ER, PR, and HER2 was done by the developed TargetPrint test and compared with immunohistochemical assessment for breast tumors from 636 patients. Immunohistochemistry was done in a central laboratory and in an independent reference laboratory according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines for 100 cases. For HER2 immunohistochemistry 2+ cases, additional chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was used to determine the final status. RESULTS: ER concordance between microarray and central immunohistochemistry was 93% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 91-95%]. Only 4% of immunohistochemistry-positive samples were classified negative using microarray, whereas 18% of immunohistochemistry-negative samples showed a positive microarray ER status. Concordance for PR was 83% (95% CI, 80-86%) and 96% of all samples showed an identical classification of HER2 status by microarray and immunohistochemistry/CISH (95% CI, 94-98%). Nine percent of immunohistochemistry HER2-positive samples showed a negative microarray classification. Detailed review of 11 cases with discordant classifications by American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists and central immunohistochemistry indicated that microarray assessment was likely to add additional information in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: Microarray-based readout of ER, PR, and HER2 shows a high concordance with immunohistochemistry/CISH and provides an additional, objective, and quantitative assessment of tumor receptor status in breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Activation of host wound responses in breast cancer microenvironment.</docTitle>
        <docText>Activation of host wound responses in breast cancer microenvironment.

PURPOSE: Cancer progression is mediated by processes that are also important in wound repair. As a result, cancers have been conceptualized as overhealing wounds or "wounds that do not heal," and gene expression signatures reflective of wound repair have shown value as predictors of breast cancer survival. Despite the widespread acknowledgment of commonalities between host responses to wounds and host responses to cancer, the gene expression responses of normal tissue adjacent to cancers have not been well characterized. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using RNA extracted from histologically normal breast tissue from 107 patients, including 60 reduction mammoplasty patients and 47 cancer patients, we measured whole genome expression profiles and identified a gene expression signature that is induced in response to breast cancer. RESULTS: This signature represents an in vivo "wound response" signature that is differentially expressed in the normal tissue of breast cancer patients compared with those without disease and is highly accurate (at least 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity) in distinguishing diseased and nondiseased. The in vivo wound response signature is highly prognostic of breast cancer survival, and there is a strong association between the groups identified by this signature and those identified using serum-treated fibroblasts and other microenvironment-derived or microenvironment-related signatures. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the wound response signature in histologically normal tissue adjacent to breast cancer suggests that microenvironment response is an important variable in breast cancer progression and may be an important target for clinical interventions.</docText>

        <docTitle>Randomized biomarker trial of anastrozole or low-dose tamoxifen or their combination in subjects with breast intraepithelial neoplasia.</docTitle>
        <docText>Randomized biomarker trial of anastrozole or low-dose tamoxifen or their combination in subjects with breast intraepithelial neoplasia.

PURPOSE: In the Anastrozole, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination trial, the combination arm was inferior to anastrozole alone in terms of disease-free survival possibly due to an adverse pharmacokinetic interaction or a predominant estrogenic effect of tamoxifen under estrogen deprivation. We assessed whether the addition of a lower dose of tamoxifen influenced anastrozole bioavailability and favorably modulated biomarkers of bone fracture, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial cancer risk. The influence of CYP2D6 genotype on tamoxifen effects was also determined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventy-five postmenopausal women with breast intraepithelial neoplasia were randomly allocated to either 1 mg/d anastrozole or 10 mg/wk tamoxifen or their combination for 12 months. Study endpoints were plasma drug concentrations and changes of C-telopeptide, osteocalcin, estradiol/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) ratio, estrone sulfate, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)/insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), C-reactive protein, antithrombin-III, endometrial Ki-67 expression, and thickness. RESULTS: Anastrozole concentrations were not affected by the combination with low-dose tamoxifen, whereas endoxifen levels were lower in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. C-telopeptide increased by 20% with anastrozole and decreased by 16% with tamoxifen and by 7% with their combination (P &lt; 0.001); osteocalcin showed similar changes. Compared with anastrozole, the combination arm showed lower IGF-I/IGFBP-3 levels (-17% versus -9%; P = 0.004) and lower estradiol/SHBG and estrone sulfate reductions (-15% versus -29% and -30% versus 38%, respectively). However, IGF-I/IGFBP-3 and estradiol/SHBG did not decrease in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Endometrial thickness was not greater in the combination than in the anastrozole arm. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a weekly tamoxifen administration did not impair anastrozole bioavailability and modulated favorably its safety profile, providing the rationale for further studies.</docText>

        <docTitle>Beyond Trastuzumab: Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in HER-2-Positive Breast Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Beyond Trastuzumab: Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in HER-2-Positive Breast Cancer.

HER-2 is a transmembrane, tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor whose overexpression is associated with adverse prognosis in breast cancer. The biological effects of HER-2 are mediated by kinase activity causing phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor molecule, leading to activation of downstream growth-promoting pathways. Antibody-mediated inhibition by trastuzumab as well as TK inhibition are clinically effective anti-HER-2 strategies. Kinase inhibitors offer some potential therapeutic advantages over antibody-based therapies. Being small molecules, TK inhibitors (TKIs) have oral bioavailability and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because of their different mode of action, TKIs may be able to overcome some of the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance. Preclinical, and limited clinical data also suggest that TKIs and trastuzumab have synergistic activity. Lapatinib is the only TKI available for clinical use at present, but several molecules with anti-HER-2 activity have been identified and are undergoing evaluation. These differ in the spectrum of kinases that they inhibit, potency of HER-2 inhibition, pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity profiles, and are at various stages of clinical development. In this article we summarize selected HER-2 TKIs approved for clinical use or in development for which clinical data are available.</docText>

        <docTitle>Prevalence of mental health conditions in cancer patients in acute care--a meta-analysis.</docTitle>
        <docText>Prevalence of mental health conditions in cancer patients in acute care--a meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: To what extent is professional psychosocial care of cancer patients in acute hospitals necessary? In a previous meta-analysis, prevalence of psychological sequelae was found to be the same as in the general population. New studies with advanced methodology have been published since; therefore, an updated meta-analysis was needed. METHODS: We systematically reviewed studies assessing the prevalence of mental health conditions in acute care hospitals with comprehensive structured clinical interviews. RESULTS: Of 46 retrieved manuscripts, eight were deemed eligible for this meta-analysis. Within the studies, 1448 cancer patients had been assessed, whereby 456 were diagnosed having a mental health disorder. The prevalence rates ranged from 23% (breast cancer patients in Turkey) to 53% (elderly cancer patients in Uganda). The combined prevalence estimate is 32% (95% confidence interval 27% to 37%). CONCLUSION: One-third of the cancer patients in acute care hospitals is suffering from mental health disorders and need appropriate treatment.</docText>

        <docTitle>Expression of androgen receptors in primary breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Expression of androgen receptors in primary breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinicopathological significance of androgen receptor (AR) expression in primary breast cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated AR using immunohistochemistry from 413 whole sections from January 2008 to March 2009 and analyzed the relationship between AR and clinicopathological parameters. Tumors with &gt;/=10% nuclear-stained cells were considered to be positive for AR. The differences among variables were calculated by chi-square test. RESULTS: The expression rate of AR was 72.9% higher than those of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors. AR expression was significant in patients with no elevated preoperative serum cancer antigen 15-3 levels, smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade and hormone receptor-positive and non-triple-negative breast cancer. However, AR expression was observed in 35% of triple-negative cancers. Metaplastic, medullary and mucinous types of carcinomas showed less AR expression. In the ER-negative subgroup, AR was significantly correlated with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER-2) overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: AR is expressed in a significant number of breast cancers and is associated with lower tumor burden and favorable differentiation. There are many issues to be further investigated such as whether AR is an independent prognostic factor, whether it is a therapeutic target for the triple-negative breast cancers and whether it is associated with HER-2 signaling in ER-negative tumors.</docText>

        <docText>Addressing cancer disparities through community engagement: improving breast health among Haitian women.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe processes for fostering community engagement among Haitian women to facilitate breast health education and outreach that are consonant with Haitians' cultural values, literacy, and linguistic skills. DATA SOURCES: Existing breast cancer education and outreach efforts for Haitian immigrant communities were reviewed. Local community partners were the primary source of information and guided efforts to create a series of health-promoting activities. The resultant partnership continues to be linked to a larger communitywide effort to reduce cancer disparities led by the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network. DATA SYNTHESIS: A systematic framework known as the CLEAN (Culture, Literacy, Education, Assessment, and Networking) Look Checklist guided efforts for improved communications. CONCLUSIONS: Community engagement forms the foundation for the development and adaptation of sustainable breast education and outreach. Understanding and considering aspects of Haitian culture are important to the provision of competent and meaningful care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should expand their skills, knowledge, and competencies to better address the changing demographics of their communities. Nurses also can play a critical role in the development of outreach programs that are relevant to the culture and literacy of Haitian women by forming mutually beneficial partnerships that can decrease health disparities in communities.</docText>

        <docTitle>Delay in diagnostic testing after abnormal mammography in low-income women.</docTitle>
        <docText>Delay in diagnostic testing after abnormal mammography in low-income women.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with diagnostic delay after an incomplete or abnormal mammogram among women participating in a state mammography screening program. RESEARCH APPROACH: Retrospective case-control design using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to explore the associations between age, race, ethnicity, marital status, breast cancer history, and self-reported breast symptoms and delay. SETTING: A statewide program of free screening mammography for women who are under- or uninsured. PARTICIPANTS: 11,460 women enrolled in a free, statewide screening program from 2002-2006. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Using the Tennessee Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program database, further analyses were conducted. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: The outcome measure was delay in completion of all diagnostic tests and was defined as women who did not complete testing within 60 days.Findings: Thirty-seven percent of women required follow-up, and of a subset used in the analysis, 30% experienced delay of more than 60 days. Controlling for marital status, age, and breast cancer history, women who experienced delay were more likely to be African American versus Caucasian (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13, 1.85) or Hispanic (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.55, 0.93) and to have self-reported breast symptoms (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.27, 1.77). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of women with low income needing mammography follow-up, delay was associated with three intrapersonal variables, potentially reducing the effectiveness of mammography screening for women who were African American, or Hispanic, or had self-reported breast symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Nurses providing cancer screening examinations are uniquely positioned to assess the knowledge, beliefs, and resources of women using the program and to navigate women through barriers to completion. Knowledge of factors associated with delay is valuable for planning interventions and allocating program resources.</docText>

        <docText>The effects of religiosity, spirituality, and social support on quality of life: a comparison between Korean American and Korean breast and gynecologic cancer survivors.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the differences in religiosity, spirituality, and quality of life (QOL) between Korean American and Korean breast and gynecologic cancer survivors and investigate the effect of religiosity, spirituality, and social support on QOL. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: Participants were recruited from hospitals and community-based support groups in the areas of Southern California and Seoul, Korea. SAMPLE: 161 women diagnosed with breast and gynecologic cancer (110 Koreans and 51 Korean Americans). METHODS: Participants completed a mailed questionnaire. To identify the QOL outcomes, religiosity, spirituality, and social support, four standardized measures were used. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: QOL outcomes, religiosity, spirituality, religious involvement, and social support. FINDINGS: Religiosity and spirituality were related to some QOL outcomes in different patterns in Korean American and Korean breast and gynecologic cancer survivors. The effect on QOL, however, was not strong after controlling for covariates. Social support partially mediated the effect of spirituality on QOL but only among the Korean American cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence that the effect of religiosity and spirituality on QOL varied between Korean American and Korean survivors. The mediating effect of social support between spirituality and QOL for Korean Americans also was demonstrated. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The results present nursing practice and research implications that religiosity, spirituality, and social support need to be considered in developing services for enhancing QOL of immigrant cancer survivors.</docText>

        <docText>Urogenital atrophy in breast cancer survivors.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To review the symptoms of urogenital atrophy in breast cancer survivors, influencing factors, and their effects on performance. DATA SOURCES: Review of qualitative and quantitative research data that describe pain, function, satisfaction, and quality of life related to urologic, genital, and sexual function. DATA SYNTHESIS: Breast cancer treatment can induce or exacerbate symptoms related to urogenital atrophy. The lower urinary and genital tracts are affected by physiologic alterations, the potential abrupt onset of menopause, and treatment side effects. Symptoms of urogenital atrophy often are more prevalent and severe in women treated for breast cancer than in age-matched women without breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms related to urogenital atrophy are common in breast cancer survivors and can be affected by physiologic, situational, and psychological influences with negative effects on performance. Research is essential to the understanding of how transient or permanent hormonal alterations affect the urogenital system and the role of these symptoms on quality of life. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses must listen with sensitivity to breast cancer survivors and their descriptions of these significant and life-altering symptoms. Personalized discussion enables the nurse to explore issues, assess symptoms, recommend interventions, and evaluate at follow-up visits. Nurses are integral to the provision of survivorship care planning that can address the short- and long-term effects of a cancer diagnosis and related treatments.</docText>

        <docText>Breast cancer in the context of intimate partner violence: a qualitative study.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer while also encountering intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV was determined by scores on the Women's Experience With Battering Scale and the Abuse Assessment Screen. RESEARCH APPROACH: Qualitative interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of seven women. Data were analyzed with a hermeneutic phenomenologic approach. SETTING: Community settings in central Virginia and Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: 7 participants ranging in age from 37-63 years (X = 50 years); age at diagnosis ranged from 36-58 years (X = 46 years). All were in relationships with men, and relationship length ranged from 2-29 years (X = 12 years). METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Each participant had one semistructured qualitative interview. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Experiences of women simultaneously experiencing breast cancer and IPV. FINDINGS: A number of themes emerged, including: (a) reassessing life, (b) believing that stress from the relationship caused the cancer, (c) valuing support from others, and (d) the significance of the breast. CONCLUSIONS: For all of the participants, the breast cancer diagnosis changed their intimate relationships in some way. The cancer was an opportunity for the women to engage in life review, focus inward, and, in some cases, change the relationship status. INTERPRETATION: Increased awareness and screening for IPV are needed in oncology clinical settings. Women with cancer are members of a vulnerable population and use the diagnosis to reassess their intimate relationships.</docText>

        <docTitle>Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.</docTitle>
        <docText>Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To review trastuzumab-related cardiotoxic effects in the breast cancer adjuvant setting, present a system for pretreatment screening for cardiovascular risk factors, describe monitoring recommendations, provide a tool to facilitate adherence to monitoring guidelines, and discuss implications for patient education. DATA SOURCES: Literature regarding cardiotoxicity and trastuzumab in breast cancer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Trastuzumab was approved in 2006 for use in the adjuvant setting. A small percentage of women (approximately 4%) developed heart failure during or after treatment. However, the trials excluded women with cardiac disease. Current screening for cardiotoxicity relies on sequential left ventricular function measurements with either echocardiography or multigated acquisition scanning at baseline and every three months. Treatment modifications are recommended if changes from baseline are detected. Long-term and late effects have yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Although a small number of women experienced cardiotoxicity in the adjuvant setting, an increase may be seen because women with preexisting heart disease receive this treatment. Guidelines and tools will be helpful for appropriate and consistent screening of cardiac risk factors and disease prior to initiation of trastuzumab and for monitoring during and after administration. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses are instrumental in assessing, monitoring, and treating women receiving trastuzumab. Implementing guidelines to promote adherence to recommended monitoring is important in the early detection of cardiotoxicity in this population. Educating women about their treatment and side effects is an important aspect of care.</docText>

        <docText>Cancer as perceived by a middle-aged Jewish urban population in Israel.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify beliefs and attitudes of a Jewish urban population in Israel regarding cancer, in the context of the present medical knowledge among lay populations. RESEARCH APPROACH: Qualitative analysis of focus groups. SETTING: Israel. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women aged 50 years and older from the larger Tel-Aviv (Israel) metropolitan area. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Nine focus group discussions were conducted including 41 men and 41 women. A structured discussion guide was developed to ensure that the groups were facilitated consistently. The discussions were transcribed verbatim. FINDINGS: Medical knowledge expressed in the focus groups was high. Cancer was regarded as many distinct diseases, each one with different chances of early detection and cure. Breast cancer and skin cancer were regarded as diseases from which the chances of recovery were high, compared to colon cancer, which was regarded as fatal. Both traditional fatalistic beliefs and views regarding cancer as a chronic disease were expressed. Genetics was expressed as having a fatalistic role and as prompting early detection. Participants expressed great fear of cancer, particularly fear of treatments and death. CONCLUSIONS: The process of incorporating knowledge and experience into the present belief system of this Jewish, urban, middle-aged population has not eliminated barriers to early detection. INTERPRETATION: The notion of cancer as a chronic disease should be promoted. Interventions aimed at forming more positive attitudes toward colon cancer are needed to increase adherence to screening recommendations. Healthcare providers and the media should try to decrease fear of cancer treatments in general.</docText>

        <docText>Using medical imaging for a comprehensive breast cancer screening program.

We described here the national breast cancer-screening program that is used, in France, today. First we depict official rules and regulations along with the organization needed to screen a whole population. Then, a technical assessment is made on the efficacy and limits on mammography analyses leading to tumor classification. Finally, an evaluation of the program is discussed.</docText>

        <docTitle>Effective breast reconstruction in female veterans.</docTitle>
        <docText>Effective breast reconstruction in female veterans.

BACKGROUND: Despite increasing female veteran numbers, literature regarding reconstruction after breast cancer is lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine breast reconstruction referral rates and reconstruction outcomes at a tertiary Veterans Affairs hospital. METHODS: Female breast cancer patients (1997-2008) were identified. Demographics, tumor stage, oncologic therapies, reconstructive timings and procedures, and complications were noted. RESULTS: Eighty-two women underwent mastectomy (46%) or breast conservation (43%). The referral rates to plastic surgery were 61% (mastectomy) and 32% (overall). Reconstruction rates were 42% (mastectomy) and 22% (overall). Sixty-nine percent were suitable candidates and chose immediate (67%) or delayed (33%) reconstruction, with implant-based (44%), autologous (39%), or autologous plus implants (17%). There were complications (28%) but no mortalities. Comorbidities were not correlated with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Breast reconstruction can be effectively delivered within the Veterans Affairs system. It is essential that sufficient Veterans Affairs resources be deployed to address the increasing reconstructive needs of female veterans.</docText>

        <docTitle>A quantitative theoretical model for the development of malignancy in ductal carcinoma in situ.</docTitle>
        <docText>A quantitative theoretical model for the development of malignancy in ductal carcinoma in situ.

Mathematical models and clinical observations have demonstrated that microenvironmental hypoxia and acidosis are important selection factors during the later stages of the somatic evolution of breast cancer. The consequent promotion of constitutive upregulation of glycolysis and resistance to acid-induced cellular toxicity is hypothesized to be critical for the ability of cancer cells to invade host tissue. In this work we developed a 3D fixed lattice cellular automata model to study the role of these two phenotypes in determining morphology and the potential for invasion of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which in this work is defined as the erosion of a healthy epithelial cell layer and direct contact with the basement membrane. The model was conceived as a 40-cell wide epithelial duct surrounded by blood vessels and composed of a basement membrane and one internal layer of epithelial cells. Our results show that an increment in the order of 8-fold in glucose metabolism and an increase in acid resistance corresponding to pH thresholds of approximately 6.8 and 6.45 for quiescence and death, respectively, are required for the tumor to breach through the layer of healthy epithelial cells and reach the basement membrane as a first step for invasion. Our model also suggests correlations between classic morphologies and different values of hyperglycolytic and acid-resistant phenotypes, indicating that immunohistochemistry studies targeting these genes may improve the predictive power of morphological analyses of biopsies.</docText>

        <docText>Interaction of drugs of abuse and maintenance treatments with human P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2).

Drug interaction with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) may influence its tissue disposition including blood-brain barrier transport and result in potent drug-drug interactions. The limited data obtained using in-vitro models indicate that methadone, buprenorphine, and cannabinoids may interact with human P-gp; but almost nothing is known about drugs of abuse and BCRP. We used in vitro P-gp and BCRP inhibition flow cytometric assays with hMDR1- and hBCRP-transfected HEK293 cells to test 14 compounds or metabolites frequently involved in addiction, including buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, methadone, ibogaine, cocaine, cocaethylene, amphetamine, N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, nicotine, ketamine, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), naloxone, and morphine. Drugs that in vitro inhibited P-gp or BCRP were tested in hMDR1- and hBCRP-MDCKII bidirectional transport studies. Human P-gp was significantly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by norbuprenorphine&gt;buprenorphine&gt;methadone&gt;ibogaine and THC. Similarly, BCRP was inhibited by buprenorphine&gt;norbuprenorphine&gt;ibogaine and THC. None of the other tested compounds inhibited either transporter, even at high concentration (100 mum). Norbuprenorphine (transport efflux ratio 11) and methadone (transport efflux ratio 1.9) transport was P-gp-mediated; however, with no significant stereo-selectivity regarding methadone enantiomers. BCRP did not transport any of the tested compounds. However, the clinical significance of the interaction of norbuprenorphine with P-gp remains to be evaluated.</docText>

        <docText>Mitotic index of invasive breast carcinoma. Achieving clinically meaningful precision and evaluating tertial cutoffs.

CONTEXT: Mitotic figure counts are related to breast cancer behavior but have not been sufficiently reproducible to be accepted for clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: To improve reproducibility and accuracy of the mitotic count. DESIGN: Mitotic index (MI) was defined as the mitotic cell count per 10 high-power fields (HPFs), an area 0.183 mm(2). Two to 6 replicate sets of 10 HPFs were counted from 328 invasive breast carcinomas. Standard errors and coefficients of variation for mean MI were compared with expected results predicted by the binomial distribution. RESULTS: The boundaries for MI that separated the data into equal thirds (tertials) were 1.14 and 5.33. Standard errors and coefficients of variation for MI followed distributions predicted by binomial probability. Mean coefficient of variation was 147% for the low tertial, 72% for the midtertial, and 34.6% for the upper tertial. CONCLUSIONS: Standard errors for MI based on a single count of 10 HPFs are too broad and coefficients of variation too large to be acceptable for clinical use. This is explained as a binomial probability effect, possibly with a contribution from tumor heterogeneity. Errors can be reduced in proportion to the square root of the number of sets of 10 HPFs counted. Tertial cutoffs of MI of the Nottingham system currently used in breast carcinoma grading are too high to be applicable to the population we studied. We recommend validation of cutoffs before they are applied to a particular population of breast carcinomas. Counting 5 sets of 10 HPFs is necessary to accurately rank carcinomas with low MIs.</docText>

        <docText>Carcinoma of the breast with medullary-like features: diagnostic challenges and relationship with BRCA1 and EZH2 functions.

This case presentation reviews the histologic distinction between pure medullary carcinoma and breast carcinomas with medullary-like features. This particular case prompts us to analyze the relationship among medullary carcinoma, basal-like breast carcinomas and carcinomas associated with germline BRCA1 mutations. In addition to now well-defined features, such as expression of high-molecular-weight cytokeratins and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), basal-like tumors have a deficiency or dysfunction of BRCA1. This association in part explains the histologic features of BRCA1-associated breast cancers. Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrate that BRCA1 protein is regulated by a recently described gene, EZH2. These concepts illustrate the important relationships among histopathologic features; genomic profile; single gene abnormalities, such as BRCA1 and EZH2; and growth regulation in this subset of breast carcinomas.</docText>

        <docText>Apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ involving a sclerosing lesion with adenosis: report of a case.

Apocrine metaplasia is a ubiquitous component of the mammary fibrocystic change spectrum. Although mostly associated with cysts, apocrine metaplasia can also present as a proliferative lesion, rarely with cytologic atypism. Apocrine atypia is characterized by 3-fold nuclear enlargement, multiple nucleoli, and hyperchromatism and generally arises in florid adenosis or radial sclerosing lesions. Dramatic apocrine atypia may be very difficult to distinguish from apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ. The latter is distinguished from apocrine atypia by greater extent of the lesion (&gt;0.4 cm) and the presence of greater nuclear pleomorphism with nuclear membrane irregularity. The clinical significance of apocrine atypia is poorly understood and reflects the lack of published outcome studies. Herein, I report a case in which apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ presented as "atypical apocrine adenosis" in a needle core breast biopsy. It illustrates the problem of assessing apocrine atypia and apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ in small samples.</docText>

        <docTitle>Angiosarcoma, radiation-associated angiosarcoma, and atypical vascular lesion.</docTitle>
        <docText>Angiosarcoma, radiation-associated angiosarcoma, and atypical vascular lesion.

Angiosarcoma, one of the least common sarcomas, has become increasingly important because of its association with radiation therapy, especially for breast cancer. Most are sporadic, presenting as cutaneous tumors in the scalp/face of elderly patients. However, angiosarcoma has a wide anatomic distribution including soft tissue, visceral organ, and osseous locations. Predisposing conditions include environmental exposures to chemical or radioactive sources. Radiation-associated angiosarcoma typically presents as a cutaneous tumor several years posttherapy. The latency for radiation-associated mammary angiosarcoma is relatively short, sometimes less than 3 years. Atypical vascular lesion refers to a small, usually lymphatic-type vascular proliferation in radiated skin. Although most atypical vascular lesions pursue a benign course, they recur and very rarely progress to angiosarcoma. Distinguishing this lesion from well-differentiated angiosarcoma in a biopsy can be challenging, especially because areas indistinguishable from atypical vascular lesion are found adjacent to angiosarcoma. Recently, vascular-type atypical vascular lesion, which resembles hemangioma, has been described, thus expanding the definition of this entity.</docText>

        <docText>Update on selected salivary gland neoplasms.

CONTEXT: Malignancies of the salivary gland are uncommon and account for 0.3% of all malignancies. In addition to their rarity, diagnosing these tumors can be challenging given the histologic overlap among various subtypes, their morphologic heterogeneity, and the recent recognition of new entities. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of 4 salivary gland malignancies that we often see in consultation, with a focus on essential diagnostic features and the importance of reporting pertinent diagnostic information to ensure appropriate clinical management. DATA SOURCES: Review of the literature, supplemented by the personal experience of the authors, which is based on their respective institutional experiences and consultation services. CONCLUSIONS: When diagnosing carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, pathologists must report several important pieces of information to allow for optimal clinical management. In addition to histologic subtype, the degree of differentiation as well as the degree of invasion, if any, must be reported because all have prognostic relevance. Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma can be a challenging diagnosis on biopsy specimens. Evaluation of the tumor periphery and nuclear features should lead to the correct diagnosis in most cases. Salivary duct carcinoma is an aggressive malignancy characterized by histologic resemblance to breast carcinoma, high-grade cytologic features, and expression of androgen receptor. Benign and malignant myoepithelial neoplasms have a broad morphologic spectrum, and immunohistochemistry is important in reaching the correct diagnosis.</docText>

        <docText>Novel Anticancer Activity of the Autocleaved Ovotransferrin against Human Colon and Breast Cancer Cells.

Proteins of avian egg albumin have been suggested to play various biological roles during the development of chick embryo to confer protection. Recently, we have shown that ovotransferrin (OTf), the second major protein in egg albumin, undergoes thiol-linked autocleavage at distinct sites upon reduction. This study explores the physiological significance of OTf autocleavage by examining the effect of the reduced autocleaved OTf (termed rac-OTf) on modulation of cell proliferation, lethality, and apoptosis in two human cancer cell lines, colon cancer (HCT-116) and breast cancer (MCF-7). The rac-OTf was prepared by reduction of OTf with a non-thiol reductant (TCEP), to avoid reductive alkylation and produce highly soluble fragments. Unlike OTf, rac-OTf remarkably inhibited the proliferation of cancerous MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effect on HCT-116, but had no effect on normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Cytofluorometric and trypan blue exclusion analyses indicated that rac-OTf exhibits cytotoxicity to HCT-116 in a dose-dependent fashion. The cytotoxic mechanism of rac-OTf against cancer cells was found to be induction of apoptosis as judged by changes in cell morphology, annexin-V binding, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-9 and -6 activation, indicating the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. This finding is the first to describe the reduction-dependent autocleaved OTf as an anticancer molecule, providing insights into a novel physiological function of OTf, suggesting its therapeutic potential in the treatment of human cancers and health benefit in nutraceuticals.</docText>

        <docText>Screening for distress in women with breast cancer diagnosed for the first time: employment of HADS-D and PO-Bado

OBJECTIVES: In the context of an intensification of efforts to ensure sufficient psychooncological care for breast-cancer patients, the discussion concerning valid psychometric screening instruments gains a special relevance. METHODS: The discriminant and diagnostic validity of HADS-D and PO-Bado were investigated in a sample of 123 women with breast cancer diagnosed for the first time. RESULTS: An ROC analysis revealed a cut-off score of greater than 9 for the subscale anxiety (sensitivity: 50%; specificity: 90%) for the use of HADS-D among breast cancer patients, whereas the recommended cut-off value was greater than 7 (sensitivity: 56%; specificity: 80%) for the subscale depression. Based on the anxiety and depression scores measured by HADS-D, 74% of the clinical cases could be classified correctly. Scores for physical and mental distress measured with PO-Bado were significantly lower in the investigated sample than in the control sample. CONCLUSIONS: HADS-D has only a moderate sensitivity for the group at hand. PO-Bado is a comprehensive basic documentation for specific psychooncological distress, though without cut-off values it is not useful as a screening instrument.</docText>

        <docText>Role of loco-regional treatments for patients with breast cancer liver metastases

Breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM) are not uncommon (about 18% of cases): although some patients have been reported as still living after 25 months, median survival after hormonal- or chemotherapy is 6-14 months. In recent years, new chemotherapy regimens and molecular targeted therapies have given medical oncologists reason to believe that metastatic disease can be eradicated, or at least controlled for prolonged periods. In an attempt to improve survival, consideration has also been given to loco-regional treatments such as hepatic resection and radio-frequency ablation, which have been associated with better outcomes in selected patients. This review considers the role of two loco-regional approaches in a multidisciplinary perspective in the treatment of single or multiple breast cancer metastases limited to the liver. An expanded role for hepatic resection and ablation is being investigated. We assessed available data in the literature to determine their role on survival outcomes. They suggest that loco-regional treatments might be of significant benefit in a selected group of women with BCLM, but the role of these local treatments in multimodality treatment of liver metastases remains controversial. It can generally be said that loco-regional treatments can improve overall survival, with no mortality and less than 20% morbidity in patients at low surgical risk; however, they should only be considered cytoreductive treatments and, as such, always need to be integrated with systemic therapy.</docText>

        <docText>XRCC1 and XRCC3 DNA repair gene polymorphisms in breast cancer women from the Lodz region of Poland.

AIM: Genetic polymorphism in XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes may influence DNA repair capacity and, in turn, confer predisposition to breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present work the distribution of genotypes and frequency of alleles of the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphism of XRCC1 and Trp241 Met polymorphism in XRCC3 in breast cancer women were analysed. Blood samples were obtained from 150 women with breast cancer and controls (n = 106). The polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP methods. RESULTS: No association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln and Arg194Trp genotype and breast cancer risk was observed. The distribution of the genotypes of the Trp241 Met polymorphism of XRCC3 in both controls and patients did not differ significantly (p &gt; 0.05) from those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg distribution. There were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) in genotype distributions and allele frequencies between subgroups assigned to histological stage. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphism of the XRCC1 gene as well as Trp241 Met polymorphism in XRCC3 may not be linked with appearance and development of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>MRI versus ultrasonography and mammography for preoperative assessment of breast cancer.

Mammography and ultrasonography are traditional for preoperative estimation of breast cancer size; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more recent but not as well studied. We compared ultrasonography, mammography, and MRI for preoperative imaging of primary breast cancer presenting as a mass in patients treated at our center over a 2-year period. Of the 61 breast cancers with all three imaging modalities performed, 52 were infiltrating ductal cancer, 5 were infiltrating lobular cancer, 2 were ductal carcinoma in situ, and 2 were other histologic types. When pathologic size was used to determine the accuracy of imaging assessments, the Pearson correlation coefficient was better for MRI (r = 0.80) than ultrasonography (r = 0.57) or mammography (r = 0.26). Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm by mammography, 1.73 cm by ultrasonography, 2.65 cm by MRI, and 2.76 cm by pathology. MRI-based tumor size was within 1 cm of pathologic size in 44 (72%) tumors, &gt; 1 cm above pathologic size in 6 (10%) tumors, and &gt; 1 cm below pathologic size in 11 (18%) tumors. We conclude that MRI is more accurate than either ultrasonography or mammography for assessment of the size of primary breast cancer presenting as a mass.</docText>

        <docText>Increased use of MRI for breast cancer surveillance and staging is not associated with increased rate of mastectomy.

The use of MRI in preoperative staging of breast cancer has escalated recently. Breast MRI has greater sensitivity than mammography, ultrasound, and clinical examination in cancer detection. Because of its variable specificity, however, there has been concern that increased MRI use will result in increased rates of mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer. We postulated that mastectomy rates are not affected by trends in MRI use. We performed a retrospective analysis of imaging tests ordered by surgeons at our breast center from 2003 to 2007. We also reviewed all breast cancer cases reported to the National Cancer Database from our institution during the same time period and categorized them as having been treated with mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. From 2003 to 2007, the number of breast MRIs ordered annually by surgeons increased from 68 to 358. The rate of MRI use increased from 4.1 per every 100 patients seen to 5.7 and from 1.6 per every 100 new patients seen to 2.9. The percentage of women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer remained unchanged during this 5-year interval. Therefore, although MRI use in breast cancer staging and surveillance has increased, mastectomy rates have not.</docText>

        <docText>Squamous cell carcinoma of the breast: a review of 177 cases.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is an uncommon breast neoplasm. There are limited data about its epidemiology and few studies focusing on outcomes. This study aims to identify specific characteristics of patients with breast SCC, investigate its natural history, and determine its long-term prognosis. One hundred and seventy-seven cases of SCC of the breast were identified in the California Cancer Registry from the years 1988 to 2006. At the time of diagnosis, 53 per cent of patients had localized disease, 32 per cent of patients had regional lymph node or locally advanced disease, and 8 per cent of patients had distant disease. The relative cumulative survival of patients was 68.1 per cent at 5 years and 60.2 per cent at 10 years. This is significantly worse than the relative cumulative survival of patients with all other invasive breast tumors during the same time period. Squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare and aggressive disease, and it has significantly worse prognosis than other nonsquamous cell tumors of the breast. Clinicians should be aware of the aggressive nature of the tumor when counseling patients.</docText>

        <docText>Disparities in the surgical management of women with stage I breast cancer.

We sought to evaluate factors influencing the choice of surgery for women with early-stage breast cancer. Between 1996 and 2005, 47,837 women who were diagnosed with Stage I breast cancer underwent partial (PM) or total mastectomy (TM) in the California Cancer Registry. A total of 72.8 per cent of women underwent PM. Those treated in the most recent 5-year period were more likely to undergo PM than in the prior 5 years (76.5 vs 69.5%, P &lt; 0.0001). PM rates increased with increasing socioeconomic status (SES): 65.1 per cent of patients in the lowest SES quintile underwent PM versus 77.2 per cent in the highest SES quintile (P &lt; 0.0001). Forty- to 64-year-old women were more likely to receive PM compared with their older and younger counterparts (74.5 vs 71.2 and 67.0%, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001). Asian/Pacific Islander women were least likely to undergo PM (64.0%), whereas non-Hispanic black women were most likely to undergo PM (75.0%) (P &lt; 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, these demographic factors remained independent predictors of surgical treatment. PM rates have increased over time; however, significant differences in surgical management exist among women of different race/ethnic groups, ages, and SES. Further research is required to elucidate modifiable factors that impact the choice of surgery for women with early-stage breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Breast, colorectal and prostate cancer screening for cancer survivors and non-cancer patients in community practices.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors have cancer surveillance and preventive screening needs that require monitoring. Little is known regarding their patterns of care in community primary care practices. METHODS: Secondary analysis of 750 baseline patient surveys and medical record audits for patients ages 50+ years in 25 community-based primary care practices (N = 109 survivors and 641 noncancer patients). RESULTS: Patient self-reported screening rates for breast cancer (72%), colorectal cancer (81%) and prostate cancer (77%) were higher for cancer survivors compared to noncancer patients (69%, 67%, 53%, respectively). Screening rates documented in the primary care records were lower for all cancers. Cancer survivors were more likely than others to report having been screened for colorectal cancer (P = 0.002) even after excluding colorectal cancer survivors from the analysis (P = 0.034). Male cancer survivors were more likely to report being screened for prostate cancer than those without cancer (P &lt; 0.001), even after excluding prostate cancer survivors (P = 0.020). There were no significant differences in either self-reported or medical record report of breast cancer screening rates among cancer survivors and noncancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors were more likely to self-report receipt of cancer screening than noncancer patients. Medical record reports of cancer screening were lower than self-reports for cancer survivors and noncancer patients. Identifying factors that affect cancer screening among cancer survivors is important and has implications for intervention design.</docText>

        <docText>The potential of survivorship care plans in primary care follow-up of minority breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: When the clinical care of minority breast cancer survivors is transferred from oncology settings to primary care, quality of care may be compromised if their primary care providers do not have adequate cancer treatment records and follow-up care guidelines. Survivorship care plans (SCPs) given to survivors before they transition to primary care settings are designed to improve the transfer of this information. This study examined these issues in a sample of minority breast cancer survivors. DESIGN: During four focus groups with minority breast cancer survivors, data were collected about the types of information survivors remember receiving from their oncologists about follow-up health care needs. Survivors were also asked their opinions on the value and content of a survivorship care plan. RESULTS: Minority breast cancer survivors received variable amounts of information about their cancer treatments. They were dissatisfied with the amount of information they received on cancer-related side-effects, including race-specific information. The American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer survivorship care plan was viewed as important, but too highly technical and limited in information on side-effects and self-care approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Survivorship care plans may help increase information transfer from oncologists to patients and primary care providers, but the content of care plans needs to be adapted to minority patients' concerns. Primary care physicians may be challenged by survivors to explain recommended surveillance guidelines and to respond to untreated physical and psychosocial problems.</docText>

        <docText>Transitioning to breast cancer survivorship: perspectives of patients, cancer specialists, and primary care providers.

BACKGROUND: Limited research exists regarding views of patients, oncology specialists, and primary care providers (PCPs) concerning breast cancer survivorship care. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively explore the needs and priorities of breast cancer survivors, oncology specialists, and PCPs. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted of survivors (21 in 5 groups), PCPs (15 in 2 groups), and oncology specialists (16 in 2 groups). One survivor group consisted of four African-Americans. Discussions used a semi-structured guide, were transcribed verbatim, and were analyzed qualitatively. Groups explored transitions to follow-up, communication, patient needs, and provider roles. RESULTS: Survivors form intense relationships with specialists for reassurance and expertise. Many believed PCPs lacked necessary oncology expertise. Survivors reported psychosocial and communication issues. African-Americans cited concerns about access to care and clinical trials, as well as taboos to discussing cancer. Specialists reported that they struggle with discharging survivors due to protective relationships. PCPs were concerned about time and training to provide survivorship care and communication problems with oncologists. Written survivorship care plans were regarded by all groups as possibly helpful, but insufficient to ease the transition. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients may experience difficulties transitioning to survivorship, including ongoing psychosocial issues. African-American patients may face additional and unique barriers to successful survivorship. Oncology specialists may have concerns about discharging cherished patients. These findings suggest a psychological component that may influence the use of written survivorship care plans. PCPs may need additional training and greater access to specialists in order to care for survivors.</docText>

        <docTitle>The economic consequences of breast cancer adjuvant hormonal treatments.</docTitle>
        <docText>The economic consequences of breast cancer adjuvant hormonal treatments.

RATIONALE: Adjuvant hormone therapy (HT) based on tamoxifen (TX) or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) has become the standard of care for treating hormone receptor -positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC) over the past 20 years. Based on clinical trial results, AI use is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology for treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer. AIs, however, are significantly more expensive than TX, raising concerns about access and use of effective treatment among women of lower socio-economic status. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between adjuvant HT modality and experience of financial hardship among a cohort of older BC survivors. Also, to examine the extent to which financial concerns affect the probability of switching between adjuvant HT modalities. DESIGN: Population-based, prospective survey study. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly (65+) women who had an incident BC surgery in 2003 and who reported receiving adjuvant HT during the first 12 months post-surgery. METHODS: Multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Use of AIs was associated with a significantly higher probability of financial hardship. Women who had taken only an AI were more likely to experience financial difficulty than women who took only TX (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7), but women who switched between TX and AI were not more likely to experience financial difficulty. Breast cancer survivors with no drug coverage (OR = 4.5; 95% CI: 3.3-5.9) or partial drug coverage (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 2.8-4.5) were more likely to experience financial difficulty compared to those with full coverage. Lack of drug coverage was also the main factor associated with the likelihood that BC survivors did not switch adjuvant HT modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant HTs have important economic consequences for BC survivors. These consequences are ameliorated by full, but not partial, drug coverage.</docText>

        <docText>The expanding use of third-generation aromatase inhibitors: what the general internist needs to know.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients represent the largest group of adult cancer survivors in the US. Most breast cancers in women 50 years of age and older are hormone receptor positive. Third generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the newest class of drugs used in treating hormone responsive breast cancer. It is often during start of adjuvant hormone therapy that the breast cancer patient establishes (or reestablishes) close follow-up with their general internist. OBJECTIVE: Given the large numbers of breast cancer patients in the US and the increasing use of third generation AI's, general internists will need to have a clear understanding of these drugs including their benefits and potential harms. Currently there are three third generation aromatase inhibitors FDA approved for use in the US. All have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in disease free survival (DFS) in the treatment of both metastatic and early breast cancers. RESULTS: While the data on side effects is limited, AI (compared to tamoxifen) may result in higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures, more arthralgias, and increased vaginal dryness and dysparuenia. Limited information on their effects on the cardiovascular system and neuro-cognitive function are also available. Patient's receiving adjuvant hormone therapy are generally considered disease free or disease stable and require less intensive monitoring by their breast cancer specialist. CONCLUSIONS: In situations where patients experience significant negative side effects from AI therapy, discussions to discontinue treatment (and switch to an alternative endocrine therapy) should involve the cancer specialist and take into consideration the patient's risk for breast cancer recurrence and the impact of therapy on their quality of life. In some cases, patients may choose to never initiate AI treatment. In other cases, patients may choose to prematurely discontinue therapy even if therapy is well tolerated. In both settings increased knowledge by the general internists will likely facilitate discussions of risks versus benefits of therapy and possibly improve compliance to adjuvant hormone therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Disrupted sleep in breast and prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy: the role of coping processes.

Background: Sleep problems are a common complaint in cancer patients that have been understudied. Methods: This study examined changes in sleep in 33 breast cancer (BC) patients and 23 prostate cancer (PC) patients during radiation therapy and over a 6-month followup. Coping processes were examined as predictors of sleep. Self-reported sleep was assessed at eight time-points before, during, and after treatment using the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale. The COPE Scale was used to assess coping processes before treatment onset. Results: Mixed effects linear modeling analyses revealed that both BC and PC patients reported the most sleep problems prior to and during the early weeks of treatment. Coping strategies predicted sleep trajectories in both groups. In particular, approach coping predicted better sleep in PC patients, whereas avoidance coping predicted worst sleep in both PC and BC patients (p's&lt;0.05). Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of evaluating sleep in patients as they undergo treatment for cancer. Additionally, they suggest that interventions aimed at increasing the use of approach-oriented coping strategies may improve sleep and quality of life in these patients.

        <docText>Breast cancer risks in individuals testing negative for a known family mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in family members of individuals with known deleterious mutations can distinguish between patients at high risk of disease and those who are not. Some studies have suggested that individuals testing negative for known familial mutations (true negatives), may still have a higher risk of breast cancer (BC) than the general population. We have examined a prospectively followed cohort of true negative women in the US. Subjects were close relatives of known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who had undergone genetic testing, were negative for the known familial mutation, and were unaffected at the time of genetic testing. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using SEER incidence rates. Among 375 true negatives, two invasive and two in situ BC and no ovarian cancers were diagnosed with mean follow up of 4.9 years (total of 1,962 person-years). Four invasive BC were expected, whereas two were observed, for an age-adjusted SIR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.13-2.09). We observed more cases of in situ BC (n = 2) than were expected (n = 0.9; SIR = 2.30; 95% CI 0.57-9.19). There were no cases of ovarian cancer observed; 0.4 case was expected. In this prospective study of women who were unaffected at the time of genetic testing and who were negative for the known familial mutation in BRCA1/2, no excess risk of invasive BC was observed. Our data suggest that such women in the US should adhere to population-based guidelines for breast cancer screening.</docText>

        <docText>The impact of preoperative breast MRI on the re-excision rate in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast.

Re-excision rates after breast conserving surgery (BCS) of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) are high. Preoperative breast MRI has the potential to reduce re-excision rates, but may lead to an increased rate of mastectomies. Hence, we assessed the influence of preoperative breast MRI on the re-excision rate and the rate of mastectomies. We performed a retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of patients with ILC who presented in one of two dedicated tertiary cancer centers between 1993 and 2005. We assessed the initial type of surgery (BCS or mastectomy), the re-excision rate and the final type of surgery. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received preoperative MRI (MR+ group) and those who did not (MR- group). In the MR- group, 27% of the patients underwent a re-excision after initial BCS. In the MR+ group, this rate was significantly lower at 9%. The odds ratio was 3.64 (95% CI: 1.30-10.20, P = 0.010). There was a trend towards a lower final mastectomy rate in the MR+ group compared to the MR- group (48 vs. 59%, P = 0.098). In conclusion, preoperative MRI in patients with ILC can reduce re-excision rates without increasing the rate of mastectomies.</docText>

        <docText>Depression and cancer risk: 24 years of follow-up of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area sample.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to characterize the relationship between depression and incident cancer. Few studies have employed population-based prospective data on subtypes of cancer to address the question. METHOD: A population-based sample of 3,177 cancer-free adults from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study who have been followed for 24 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative hazards for both overall and subtype-specific cancers among those with a history of depression. RESULTS: The risk set contained 334 incident cancer cases and 40,530 person-years of observation. DIS/DSM-III major depression was associated with a higher hazard for overall cancer (HR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.0) and a statistically significant increased hazard for breast cancer (HR: 4.4, 95% CI: 1.08, 17.6) among women. There was a positive association between history of depression and prostate cancer, but confidence bounds included the null. No reliable associations were found between colon, lung, or skin cancers and depression. The pattern of results was similar for dysphoria, but not for phobia or any other mental disorder studied. CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal a specificity to the association between depression and hormonally mediated cancers, which provides support to hypotheses about a common biological pathway between depression and cancer. Further research can build on observational studies to examine the mechanisms through which our emotions affect our health.</docText>

        <docText>Effects of protein kinase Cdelta and phospholipase C-gamma1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in taxol-induced breast cancer cell death.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a CC chemokine that plays an important role in immune cell migration. It has been reported that chemokines, including MCP-1, are involved in angiogenesis and metastasis. However, the exact role of chemokines in cancer development is still obscure. We investigated the involvement of MCP-1 in taxol-induced breast cancer cell death. The anti-cancer drug taxol induced MCF-7 breast cancer cell death. Treatment with taxol increased the mRNA expression level of MCP-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Up-regulation of MCP-1 by taxol was augmented in cells treated with rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). In addition, taxol-induced MCP-1 expression was reduced by the ectopic expression of PKCdelta in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that PKCdelta plays a negative role in taxol-induced MCP-1 expression in MCF-7 cells. On the other hand, taxol-induced up-regulation of MCP-1 was reduced in cells treated with U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), and ectopic expression of PLC-gamma1 increased the expression of MCP-1 in taxol-treated MCF-7 cells, indicating that PLC-gamma1 functions as a positive regulator in taxol-induced MCP-1 expression. These results indicate that MCP-1 is involved in taxol-induced breast cancer cell death and we propose that taxol induces up-regulation of MCP-1 by affecting both positive and negative regulatory signaling pathways.</docText>

        <docTitle>Experimental study of the anti-cancer mechanism of tanshinone IIA against human breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Experimental study of the anti-cancer mechanism of tanshinone IIA against human breast cancer.

Tanshinone IIA is a widely used Chinese herbal medicine isolated from Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza). Recent studies indicate that tanshinone IIA may have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, as well as cytotoxic activities against multiple human cancer cell lines. This study was performed to determine the anti-cancer activity of tanshinone IIA on human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this activity. Human breast cancer cell lines (estrogen receptor-positive and -negative) were treated with tanshinone IIA and tamoxifen. The inhibitory effects of tanshinone IIA and tamoxifen on breast cancer cell proliferation were examined using MTT assays, BrdU incorporation, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Upon treatment with tanshinone IIA, breast cancer cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.25 microg/ml) and apoptotic cell populations increased, while tamoxifen inhibited only ER-positive breast cancer cells prominently and had no effect on ER-negative cells. In addition, tamoxifen had significantly weaker inhibitory effect than tanshinone IIA on ER-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, tanshinone IIA decreased the expression of P53 and bcl-2, but not of cerbB-2, in estrogen receptor-positive and negative xenografted nude mice. Our findings suggest that tanshinone IIA might have potential anti-cancer activity that is stronger than tamoxifen in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers. This function could be attributed in part to its inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis induction in cancer cells via the downregulation of multiple genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA synthesis.</docText>

        <docText>5-Fluorouracil combined with apigenin enhances anticancer activity through induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells.

We investigated the effects of combined treatment with 5-fluorouracil and apigenin on proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the underlying mechanism, in human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells. The MDA-MB-453 cells, which have been shown to overexpress ErbB2, were resistant to 5-fluorouracil; 5-fluorouracil exhibited a small dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect, with an IC50 of 90 microM. Interestingly, combined treatment with apigenin significantly decreased the resistance. Cellular proliferation was significantly inhibited in cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil at its IC50 and apigenin (5, 10, 50 and 100 microM), compared with proliferation in cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil alone. This inhibition in turn led to apoptosis, as evidenced by an increased number of apoptotic cells and the activation of caspase-3. To investigate the mechanism by which the combination of 5-fluorouracil and apigenin induces apoptosis, ErbB2 expression was analyzed. The level of ErbB2 was unchanged by 5-fluorouracil alone but was drastically reduced in cells treated with 5-fluorouracil plus apigenin. Moreover, compared with 5-fluorouracil alone, 5-fluorouracil in combination with apigenin at concentrations &gt;10 microM exerted a pro-apoptotic effect via the inhibition of Akt expression. Taken together, our results suggest that 5-fluorouracil acts synergistically with apigenin inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis via the down-regulation of ErbB2 expression and Akt signaling.</docText>

        <docText>Adipocyte culture medium stimulates invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cell via CCL20 production.

We explored whether adipocyte culture medium affects the secreted chemokine profile of tumor cells, because adipocytes stimulate progression or metastasis of breast cancer cells, and chemokines secreted from tumor cells are involved in these processes. CCL20 expression was dramatically increased, and an NF-kappaB blocker completely inhibited adipocyte culture medium-induced CCL20 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. We showed that adipocyte culture medium increased the production of TNF-alpha in MDA-MB-231 cells, which stimulated CCL20 expression in an autocrine fashion. Our data also showed that CCL20 increased the migration and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, but did not affect the proliferation of these cells.</docText>

        <docText>Gene polymorphisms in TYMS, MTHFR, p53 and MDR1 as risk factors for breast cancer: a case-control study.

Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease influenced by environmental and genetic factors. The disease has important genetic and environmental components, most of them are still unknown. An important role of gene polymorphisms related to the risk of developing BC has been reported. However, the results have been controversial. We investigated the association of TSER, MTHFR C677T, p53 codon 72 and MDR1 C3435T gene polymorphisms with breast carcinoma in women from Canary Islands (Spain). Blood samples collected from 135 patients with BC and 304 healthy controls all of them Caucasian, were analyzed through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Subsequently, a structured questionnaire including patient history and risk factors in relation to BC development was filled out. Allelic frequencies of these genetic variations were: TSER, (2) 0.55 and (3) 0.45 in cases, 0.49 and 0.51 respectively in controls (P=0.240); MTHFR C677T, (C) 0.63 and (T) 0.37 in cases, 0.60 and 0.40 respectively in controls (P=0.568); p53 Arg72Pro, (Arg) 0.74 and (Pro) 0.26 in cases and controls (P=0.910); MDR1 C3435T, (C) 0.52 and (T) 0.48 in cases, 0.55 and 0.45 respectively in controls (P=0.523). We did not observe any gene polymorphism as a risk factor to develop BC. A statistical association was observed between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and family history of breast cancer in both groups, as well as between MDR1 C3435T and smoking habits in cases (P&lt;0.05). Gene polymorphisms vary by regions. The present study contributes to the characterization of the genetic pattern of the Canary population.</docText>

        <docTitle>Novel 8-hydroxylquinoline analogs induce copper-dependent proteasome inhibition and cell death in human breast cancer cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Novel 8-hydroxylquinoline analogs induce copper-dependent proteasome inhibition and cell death in human breast cancer cells.

An elevated level of copper (Cu), which is necessary for the growth and metastasis of tumor cells, has been found in many types of cancer, including breast, prostate, lung and brain. Although its molecular basis is unclear, this tumor-specific Cu elevation has been proposed to be a novel target for developing selective anti-cancer therapies. We previously reported that 8-hydroxylquinoline (8-OHQ) is able to form a Cu complex that inhibits the proteasome and induces apoptosis in cultured cancer cells. Toward the goal of discovering novel 8-OHQ analogs as potential anti-copper and anti-cancer drugs, in the current study we synthesized several 8-OHQ analogs and their copper complexes and evaluated their biological activities in human breast cancer cells. We report that when substitutions are made on the hydroxyl group of 8-OHQ, their copper mixtures have profound effects on the proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing abilities in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, the proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities of 8-OHQ analog-copper mixtures are determined by both the polarity and position of the substituents. Finally, a synthetic complex of 8-OHQ analog-copper was able to inhibit the proteasome activity, induce cell death and suppress the growth selectively in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in normal immortalized human breast MCF-10A cells. Our results support the concept that human cancer cells and tissues, which contain an elevated copper level and are highly dependent on proteasome activity for their survival, should be sensitive to treatment with anti-copper drugs such as the novel 8-OHQ analogs described here.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cell density-dependent regulation of p73 in breast cancer cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cell density-dependent regulation of p73 in breast cancer cells.

Molecular regulation of p73, a p53 family member, remains unclear. Here we report that p73 expression is significantly regulated by cell densities. In particular, we found that p73alpha and p73beta are differentially regulated. While p73beta protein levels were inversely correlated with cell densities, p73alpha protein levels behaved oppositely. We further showed that density-dependent changes of p73alpha follow the same patterns as E2F-1 and TAp73 mRNA levels, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Our data also suggest that high levels of p73beta at lower densities may be due to increased protein stability. However, AIP-4/Itch appeared not to be involved in downregulation of p73beta at high densities. Moreover, we also found that subcellular location of p73 isoforms changes with the culture density increases. While high level of p73beta at low density was mainly presented in the nucleus, low levels of this protein at high densities were mainly in the cytosol. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that differentially regulates p73 isoforms and underscores the role of cell-cell interaction in p73 regulation, which may advance our understanding of p73 expression and function in human cancers.</docText>

        <docTitle>Fatty acid synthase activity regulates HER2 extracellular domain shedding into the circulation of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients.</docTitle>
        <docText>Fatty acid synthase activity regulates HER2 extracellular domain shedding into the circulation of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients.

Clinicopathological assessment of the functional relationship between the HER2 oncogene and tumor-associated fatty acid synthase (FASN) is largely precluded because immunohistochemical and/or mRNA studies should be performed in biopsies from breast cancer patients. We here sought to determine whether serum FASN (sFASN) could associate with circulating HER2 extracellular domain (HER2 ECD) in the blood of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. Concentrations of serum FASN and HER2 ECD were measured with ELISA in sera retrospectively obtained from 201 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and 31 healthy subjects. Mechanistical in vitro studies were performed using pharmacological inhibitors of HER2 and FASN as well as cultured cancer cells engineered to overexpress HER2 and FASN human genes. When the upper limit of normal sFASN was defined as the mean + 2SD of the control group, sFASN was elevated above this cut-off (12 ng/ml) in 70 MBC patients (35%). Eighty-nine MBC patients (44%) had elevated levels of HER2 ECD (HER2 ECD cut-off = 15 ng/ml). HER2 ECD-positive MBC patients slightly increased their sFASN levels compared with HER2 ECD-negative MBC patients. sFASN-positive MBC patients had significantly increased levels of HER2 ECD when compared with sFASN-negative MBC patients (mean HER2 ECD=34 ng/ml, 95% CI 26-41 ng/ml and 18 ng/ml -95% CI 15-21 ng/ml, respectively; p=0.002). Sixty percent of sFASN-positive patients concurrently exhibited high levels of HER2 ECD whereas 64% of sFASN-negative patients were negative for circulating HER2 ECD. In vitro studies revealed that BC cells bearing HER2 gene-amplification released higher levels of extracellular FASN than HER2-negative BC cells. Trastuzumab-induced blockade of HER2 ECD shedding failed to prevent FASN release and retrovirally-induced HER2 overexpression in MCF-7 cells did not increase extracellular FASN. Of note, pharmacological inhibition of FASN activity significantly decreased HER2 ECD levels in the supernatant of HER2-overexpressing BC cells while transient overexpression of FASN gene in HBL100 cells promoted FASN protein release and concomitantly increased HER2 ECD shedding into the extracellular milieu. Subsequent studies should explore if quantitative determination of FASN molecules in blood could become a rapid and accurate non-invasive test to monitor disease progression and survival in HER2-overexpressing MBC undergoing HER2-targeted therapies.</docText>

        <docText>Novel 1D chain Fe(III)-salen-like complexes involving anionic heterocyclic N-donor ligands. Synthesis, X-ray structure, magnetic, (57)Fe Mössbauer, and biological activity studies.

The iron(III) salen-type complexes [Fe(salen)(L)](n) (1-6) involving heterocyclic N-donor ligands HL {HL = 1H-imidazole (Himz), 1H-tetrazol-5-amine (Hatz), 5-methyl-1H-tetrazole (Hmtz), 1H-benzimidazole (Hbimz), 1H-1,2,4-triazole (Htriz) and 1H-benzotriazole (Hbtriz)} have been prepared and characterised by elemental analysis, FT IR, CI mass and (57)Fe Mössbauer spectroscopies, and variable temperature magnetic measurements. Single crystal X-ray analysis of [Fe(salen)(btriz)](n) (6) revealed a 1D chain-polymeric structure of the complex with the btriz anion as a bridging ligand. Magnetic data for all complexes were fitted using Fisher's model (for S = 5/2) and also using a heptanuclear closed ring model showing a weak antiferromagnetic interaction (J approximately -1 to -2 cm(-1)), and moreover, molecule-based magnet properties have been observed in the case of [Fe(salen)(atz)](n) (2). The exponential correlation between the magnetic properties (the isotropic exchange parameter J) and the basicity of the free ligands (K(b)) has been found. The antiferromagnetic ordering as well as a moderate structural dissimilarity in the vicinity of iron atoms has been proved by the (57)Fe Mössbauer low-temperature (2 K) in-field (7 T) experiments in the case of (2), in which two sextets with the line intensities (3/4/1/3/4/1) have been observed. The compounds have been tested for their SOD-like activity, DNA cleavage activity, and in vitro cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines: chronic myelogenous erythroleukemia (K562) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7).

        <docText>Metastatic gastric linitis plastica from bladder cancer mimicking a primary gastric carcinoma: a case report.

Primary gastric carcinoma is the most common cause of linitis plastica. Less frequently, metastatic gastric cancer from the breast, omental metastases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the stomach have been reported to show similar radiographic findings as for linitis plastica. A metastatic gastric cancer from bladder cancer is extremely rare. We present an unusual case, the first to our knowledge, of gastric linitis plastica that resulted from a metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.</docText>

        <docText>Usefulness of a small-field digital mammographic imaging system using parabolic polycapillary optics as a diagnostic imaging tool: a preliminary study.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy for spatial resolution and radiation dose of a small-field digital mammographic imaging system using parabolic polycapillary optics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a small-field digital mammographic imaging system composed of a CCD (charge coupled device) detector and an X-ray source coupled with parabolic polycapillary optics. The spatial resolution and radiation dose according to various filters were evaluated for a small-field digital mammographic imaging system. The images of a test standard phantom and breast cancer tissue sample were obtained. RESULTS: The small-field digital mammographic imaging system had spatial resolutions of 12 lp/mm with molybdenum and rhodium filters with a 25-microm thickness. With a thicker molybdenum filter (100 microm thick), the system had a higher spatial resolution of 11 lp/mm and contrast of 0.48. The radiation dose for a rhodium filter with a 25-microm thickness was 0.13 mGy within a 10-mm-diameter local field. A larger field image greater than 10 mm in diameter could be obtained by scanning an object. On the small-field mammographic imaging system, microcalcifications of breast cancer tissue were clearly observed. CONCLUSION: A small-field digital mammographic imaging system with parabolic polycapillary optics may be a useful diagnostic tool for providing high-resolution imaging with a low radiation dose for examination of local volumes of breast tissue.</docText>

        <docText>Antifungal and Anticancer Activities of a Protein from the Mushroom Cordyceps militaris.

The mushroom Cordyceps militaris has been used for a long time in eastern Asia as a nutraceutical and in traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment for cancer patients. In the present study, a cytotoxic antifungal protease was purified from the dried fruiting bodies of C. militaris using anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose column. Electrophoretic analyses indicated that this protein, designated C. militaris protein (CMP), has a molecular mass of 12 kDa and a pI of 5.1. The optimum conditions for protease activity were a temperature of 37 and pH of 7.0~9.0. The enzyme activity was specifically inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Amino acid composition of intact CMP and amino acid sequences of three major peptides from a tryptic digest of CMP were determined. CMP exerted strong antifungal effect against the growth of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and exhibited cytotoxicity against human breast and bladder cancer cells. These results indicate that C. militaris represents a source of a novel protein that might be applied in diverse biological and medicinal applications.</docText>

        <docText>Does a Three-Field Electron/Minitangent Photon Technique Offer Dosimetric Advantages to a Multifield, Photon-Only Technique for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation?

PURPOSE:: To determine whether 3-field electron/minitangent photons (mixed-modality) technique improved dosimetry compared with a multifield, photon-only technique for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Subjects were 20 breast cancer patients previously treated with photon-only APBI as part of a clinical trial to a dose of 38.5Gy/10 fractions in 5 days. Mixed-modality replans were compared with the photon-only plans with regards to planning target volume (PTV) coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and doses to normal tissues. RESULTS:: The mixed-modality plans had similar PTV coverage, with more conformality, and reduced the volume of the ipsilateral breast receiving &gt;/=95% and &gt;/=50% doses, but had the pitfalls of less homogeneity and increased exposure of the ipsilateral lung and heart receiving low-dose radiation because of the exit dose of the electron beam. Factors associated with this increase were medial/deep-seated tumor beds, large tumor beds with PTV/Ipsilateral Breast ratio &gt;20%, and use of high energy electrons. CONCLUSIONS:: The three-field electron/minitangent photon APBI technique was more conformal and reduced the dose to the ipsilateral breast but had the disadvantage of exposing increased volumes of heart and ipsilateral lung to low-dose radiation compared with the photon-only technique.</docText>

        <docTitle>DNA Damage Repair and Telomere Length in Normal Breast, Preneoplastic Lesions, and Invasive Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>DNA Damage Repair and Telomere Length in Normal Breast, Preneoplastic Lesions, and Invasive Cancer.

OBJECTIVES:: Carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic and molecular abnormalities. It has been suggested that there is a relationship between telomere attrition in the early stages of carcinogenesis and activation of the DNA damage response machinery. We explored telomere length modification and damage response pathway activation at 3 steps of breast carcinogenesis. METHODS:: We carried out a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of pathway ataxia telangiectasia mutated (p-ATM) (series 1981) and gamma-H2AX (series 139) levels in normal breast, preneoplastic lesions, and invasive carcinoma. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to analyze telomere length at each stage. RESULTS:: ATM was activated in 45% of normal tissue samples, 70% of preneoplastic lesions, and 14% of breast carcinomas. The increase in ATM activation, between normal tissues and preneoplasia, was not significant (P = 0.095), whereas, ATM repression between preneoplasia and cancer was significant (P = 0.0023). Telomeres in preneoplastic lesions were more frequently shorter than those in normal tissues (P = 0.0116). Finally, telomere lengths were long in 38.9% and very short in 38.9% of breast carcinomas (P = 0.0087 for comparisons with preneoplastic lesions). CONCLUSIONS:: This study suggests that a major defect in DNA repair occurs between preneoplasia and breast cancer. This defect is associated with changes in telomere length between the preneoplastic and the cancer stage.</docText>

        <docText>Breast Conserving Surgery and Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation After Prior Breast Radiation Therapy.

OBJECTIVE:: Although mastectomy has been traditional treatment for breast cancer after prior radiotherapy, patients are increasingly requesting additional breast conservation. This report details our experience of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as a component of salvage breast conserving treatment. METHODS:: Eleven patients with prior external beam radiotherapy to the breast were treated with lumpectomy and APBI using high dose rate iridium-192 to a dose of 34 gray with 10 twice-daily fractions over 5 days. Six patients were previously treated for Hodgkin disease, 4 for invasive or in situ breast cancer, and 1 for soft tissue sarcoma. All had tumor &lt;/=2 cm, negative nodes, and negative margins. RESULTS:: At median follow-up of 53.7 months, 10 patients were alive without evidence of disease recurrence following treatment which occurred at median interval of 19.1 years after prior radiotherapy. One was lost to follow-up. One developed mastitis under treatment requiring oral and IV antibiotics. Another received oral antibiotics for 6 weeks following formation of a draining sinus tract with contracture and painless fibrosis. Three others reported slight to moderate firmness. Four noted mild hyperpigmentation, but none developed telangiectasia. One patient with prior whole breast radiation had necrosis requiring mastectomy 9.4 months following retreatment, with pathology revealing a chronic breast abscess. Of the 9 women with successful breast conservation, all but one reported satisfaction pursuing breast conservation rather than mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS:: Repeat lumpectomy and APBI for in-breast tumor recurrence after prior external beam radiotherapy has been delivered with acceptable outcomes, justifying a phase II multicenter trial for validation.</docText>

        <docText>Evidence for direct involvement of epirubicin in the formation of chromosomal translocations in t(15;17) therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (t-APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12~21) involving the PML and RARA genes, is associated with exposure to agents targeting topoisomerase II (topoII), particularly mitoxantrone and epirubicin. We previously have shown that mitoxantrone preferentially induces topoII-mediated DNA damage in a "hotspot region" within PML intron 6. To investigate mechanisms underlying epirubicin associated t-APL, t(15;17) genomic breakpoints were characterized in 6 cases with prior breast cancer. Significant breakpoint clustering was observed in PML and RARA loci (p=0.009 and p=0.017, respectively), with PML breakpoints lying outside the mitoxantrone-associated hotspot region. Recurrent breakpoints identified in the PML and RARA loci in epirubicin-related t-APL were shown to be preferential sites of topoII-induced DNA damage, enhanced by epirubicin. Although site preferences for DNA damage differed between mitoxantrone and epirubicin, the observation that particular regions of the PML and RARA loci are susceptible to these agents may underlie their respective propensities to induce t-APL.</docText>

        <docText>One-Year Outcomes of a Behavioral Therapy Intervention Trial on Sleep Quality and Cancer-Related Fatigue.

PURPOSE: To determine 1-year outcomes of a four-component behavioral therapy (BT) sleep intervention (Individualized Sleep Promotion Plan [ISPP]) versus a healthy eating control (HEC) on cancer-related fatigue in women receiving breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (CTX). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 219 participants from 12 oncology clinics were randomly assigned in a clinical trial. Before CTX, research nurses coached intervention participants to develop a BT plan including stimulus control, modified sleep restriction, relaxation therapy, and sleep hygiene. BT plans were revised before each CTX and 30, 60, and 90 days after the last CTX and reinforced 7 to 9 days later. HEC participants received nutritional information and equal attention. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Daily Diary, Wrist Actigraph, and Piper Fatigue Scale measures and Repeated Linear Mixed Model analysis following the Intent to Treat paradigm were used. RESULTS: Sleep quality differed over 1 years time (F [4,162] = 7.7, P &lt; .001; by group, F [1,173] = 4.8, P = .029; and over time by group, F [4,162] = 3.3, P = .013). Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between groups at 90 days (P = .002) but not at 1 year (P = .052). Seven days of diary and actigraphy data did not corroborate with monthly reflections (PSQI). The night awakenings (Actigraph) pattern was significantly different by group over time (P = .046), with no differences between groups at 90 days or at 1 year. Fatigue was lower at 1 year than before CTX; no group effects were found. CONCLUSION: The BT group, on average, experienced significant improvement on global sleep quality compared with the HEC group, but not on objective sleep or fatigue outcomes.</docText>

        <docText>Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, and Cyclophosphamide With Either Docetaxel or Vinorelbine, With or Without Trastuzumab, As Adjuvant Treatments of Breast Cancer: Final Results of the FinHer Trial.

PURPOSE: Docetaxel has not been compared with vinorelbine as adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. Efficacy and long-term safety of a short course of adjuvant trastuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive cancer are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand ten women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive three cycles of docetaxel or vinorelbine, followed in both groups by three cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). Women with HER2-positive cancer (n = 232) were further assigned to either receive or not receive trastuzumab for 9 weeks with docetaxel or vinorelbine. The median follow-up time was 62 months after random assignment. RESULTS: Women assigned to docetaxel had better distant disease-free survival (DDFS) than those assigned to vinorelbine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.91; P = .010). In the subgroup of HER2-positive disease, patients treated with trastuzumab tended to have better DDFS than those treated with chemotherapy only (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.12; P = .12; with adjustment for presence of axillary nodal metastases, HR = 0.57; P = .047). In exploratory analyses, docetaxel, trastuzumab, and FEC improved DDFS compared with docetaxel plus FEC (HR = 0.32; P = .029) and vinorelbine, trastuzumab, and FEC (HR = 0.31; P = .020). The median left ventricular ejection fraction of trastuzumab-treated patients remained unaltered during the 5-year follow-up; only one woman treated with trastuzumab was diagnosed with a heart failure. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant treatment with docetaxel improves DDFS compared with vinorelbine. A brief course of trastuzumab administered concomitantly with docetaxel is safe and effective and warrants further evaluation.</docText>

        <docTitle>Application of Screening Principles to the Reconstructed Breast.</docTitle>
        <docText>Application of Screening Principles to the Reconstructed Breast.

A significant number of women choose mastectomy for the treatment of early and locally advanced breast cancer. Advances in reconstruction techniques and greater awareness of options have led to an increased use of immediate breast reconstruction, which has resulted in uncertainty for the management of surveillance for local recurrence. In this article, we review mastectomy and reconstruction trends and how these techniques affect the frequency and location of local recurrence. The data on surveillance imaging of the reconstructed breast are extremely limited. However, by assessing the potential role for imaging in this setting and applying the principles of screening, we have identified that there is a potential theoretic advantage of surveillance imaging in a very small subset of women: those with autologous tissue reconstructions and moderate to high risk of recurrence. A prospective registry study of surveillance imaging in this target population would be the appropriate way to determine its benefit and its impact on survival outcomes. In this review article, we will detail the reasons that should allow clinicians to forego routine surveillance imaging in the majority of women who undergo mastectomy and reconstruction.</docText>

        <docText>Clinical Relevance of HER2 Overexpression/Amplification in Patients With Small Tumor Size and Node-Negative Breast Cancer.

PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic role of HER2 overexpression/amplification in patients with node-negative, pT1a-b breast cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were identified among a population of 2,130 patients whose diseases were staged as pT1a-b, pN0 and who underwent surgery at the European Institute of Oncology from 1999 to 2006. A matched cohort was selected by using variables of hormone receptor status, age, and year of surgery. We estimated rates of local and distant recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in the two groups. RESULTS: We identified 150 consecutive patients with pT1a-b, pN0, HER2-positive tumors. No patient received adjuvant trastuzumab. The median follow-up was 4.6 years (range, 1.0 to 9.0 years). In the hormone receptor-positive group, 5-year DFS rates were 99% (95% CI, 96% to 100%) for HER2-negative disease and 92% (95% CI, 86% to 99%) for HER2-positive disease. In the hormone receptor-negative group, 5-year DFS rates were 92% (95% CI, 84% to 100%) for HER2-negative disease and 91% (95% CI, 84% to 99%) for HER2-positive disease. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) associated with HER2 overexpression was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.9 to 6.5; P = .09). After analysis was adjusted for pT1 stage, hormone receptor-positive disease with HER2-positive status was associated with a worse prognosis (HR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 25.7). OS in HER2-positive, pT1a-b, pN0 breast cancer was similar irrespective of the hormone receptor status (P = .93). CONCLUSION: Patients with node-negative, HER2 positive, pT1a-b breast cancer have a low risk of recurrence at 5 years of follow-up. In patients with hormone receptor-positive disease and pT1a-b, N0 tumors, HER2 overexpression was associated with a worse DFS.</docText>

        <docText>Understanding the Mechanisms Behind Trastuzumab Therapy for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer.

PURPOSE: Targeted therapy with the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has become a mainstay for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer (BC). The mechanisms of action of trastuzumab have not been fully elucidated, and data available to date are reviewed here. The impact of the mechanisms of action on clinical benefit also is discussed. METHODS: An extensive literature review of trastuzumab and proposed mechanisms of action was performed. RESULTS: At least five potential extracellular and intracellular antitumor mechanisms of trastuzumab have been identified in the preclinical setting. These include activation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, inhibition of extracellular domain cleavage, abrogation of intracellular signaling, reduction of angiogenesis, and decreased DNA repair. These effects lead to tumor cell stasis and/or death. Clinical benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy in both early and advanced BC has been demonstrated. The benefit of trastuzumab use beyond progression has also been shown, which indicates the need for continuous suppression of the HER2 pathway. Targeting both HER2, with various approaches, and other pathways may enhance the clinical benefit observed with trastuzumab and overcome potential resistance. Novel combinations include pertuzumab (a HER2 dimerization inhibitor), lapatinib (a HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor), bevacizumab (an antiangiogenic agent), tanespimycin (a heat shock protein inhibitor), antiestrogen therapies, and an antibody-drug conjugate (trastuzumab-DM1). CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab is the foundation of care for patients with HER2-positive BC. Emerging data from studies of other targeted agents may provide alternative treatment combinations to maximize the clinical benefit from trastuzumab and prevent or delay resistance. The continued development of trastuzumab highlights promising treatment approaches for the future.</docText>

        <docText>Patients' Supportive Care Needs Beyond the End of Cancer Treatment: A Prospective, Longitudinal Survey.

PURPOSE: To estimate prevalence and severity of patients' self-perceived supportive care needs in the immediate post-treatment phase and identify predictors of unmet need. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, longitudinal survey was conducted. Sixty-six centers recruited patients for 12 weeks. Patients receiving treatment for the following cancers were recruited: breast, prostate, colorectal, and gynecologic cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Measures of supportive care needs, anxiety and depression, fear of recurrence, and positive and negative affect were completed at the end of treatment (T0) and 6 months later (T1). RESULTS: Of 1,850 patients given questionnaire packs, 1,425 (79%) returned questionnaires at T0, and 1,152 (62%) returned questionnaires at T1. Mean age was 61 years; and most respondents were female (69%) and had breast cancer (57%). Most patients had no or few moderate or severe unmet supportive care needs. However, 30% reported more than five unmet needs at baseline, and for 60% of these patients, the situation did not improve. At both assessments, the most frequently endorsed unmet needs were psychological needs and fear of recurrence. Logistic regression revealed several statistically significant predictors of unmet need, including receipt of hormone treatment, negative affect, and experiencing an unrelated significant event between assessments. CONCLUSION: Most patients do not express unmet needs for supportive care after treatment. Thirty percent reported more than five moderate or severe unmet needs at both assessments. Unmet needs were predicted by hormone treatment, negative mood, and experiencing a significant event. Our results suggest that there is a proportion of survivors with unmet needs who might benefit from the targeted application of psychosocial resources.</docText>

        <docTitle>Advanced Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Mortality in Randomized Controlled Trials on Mammography Screening.</docTitle>
        <docText>Advanced Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Mortality in Randomized Controlled Trials on Mammography Screening.

PURPOSE: We assessed changes in advanced cancer incidence and cancer mortality in eight randomized trials of breast cancer screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Depending on published data, advanced cancer was defined as cancer &gt;/= 20 mm in size (four trials), stage II+ (four trials), and &gt;/= one positive lymph node (one trial). For each trial, we obtained the estimated relative risk (RR) and 95% CI between the intervention and control groups, for both breast cancer mortality and diagnosis of advanced breast cancer. Using a meta-regression approach, log(RR-mortality) was regressed on log(RR-advanced cancer), weighting each trial by the reciprocal of the square of the standard error of log(RR) for mortality. RESULTS: RR for advanced breast cancer ranged from 0.69 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.78) in the Swedish Two-County Trial to 0.97 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.25) in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study-1 (NBSS-1) trial. Log(RR)s for advanced cancer were highly predictive of log(RR)s for mortality (R(2) = 0.95; P &lt; .0001), and the linear regression curve had a slope of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.25) after fixing the intercept to zero. The slope changed only slightly after excluding the Two-County Trial and the Canadian NBSS-1 and NBSS-2 trials. CONCLUSION: In trials on breast cancer screening, for each unit decrease in incidence of advanced breast cancer, there was an equal decrease in breast cancer mortality. Monitoring of incidence of advanced breast cancer may provide information on the current impact of screening on breast cancer mortality in the general population.</docText>

        <docText>High Risk of Recurrence for Patients With Breast Cancer Who Have Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive, Node-Negative Tumors 1 cm or Smaller.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk of recurrence in women diagnosed with T1a and T1b, node-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer. METHODS: We reviewed 965 T1a,bN0M0 breast cancers diagnosed at our institution between 1990 and 2002. Dedicated breast pathologists confirmed HER2 positivity if 3+ by immunohistochemistry or if it had a ratio of 2.0 or greater by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy or trastuzumab were excluded. Kaplan-Meier product was used to calculate recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS). Cox proportional hazard models were fit to determine associations between HER2 status and survival after adjustment for patient and disease characteristics. Additionally, 350 breast cancers from two other institutions were used for validation. RESULTS: Ten percent of patients had HER2-positive tumors. At a median follow-up of 74 months, there were 72 recurrences. The 5-year RFS rates were 77.1% and 93.7% in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumors, respectively (P &lt; .001). The 5-year DRFS rates were 86.4% and 97.2% in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumors, respectively (P &lt; .001). In multivariate analysis, patients with HER2-positive tumors had higher risks of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.68; 95% CI, 1.44 to 5.0; P = .002) and distant recurrence (HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.23 to 12.62; P &lt; .001) than those with HER2-negative tumors. Patients with HER2-positive tumors had 5.09 times (95% CI, 2.56 to 10.14; P &lt; .0001) the rate of recurrences and 7.81 times (95% CI, 3.17 to 19.22; P &lt; .0001) the rate of distant recurrences at 5 years compared with patients who had hormone receptor-positive tumors. CONCLUSION: Patients with HER2-positive T1abN0M0 tumors have a significant risk of relapse and should be considered for systemic, anti-HER2, adjuvant therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Multimodality Screening of High-Risk Women: A Prospective Cohort Study.

PURPOSE: Mammography has been established as the primary imaging screening method for breast cancer; however, the sensitivity of mammography is limited, especially in women with dense breast tissue. Given the limitations of mammography, interest has developed in alternative screening techniques. This interest has led to numerous studies reporting mammographically occult breast cancers detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound. In addition, digital mammography was shown to be more sensitive than film mammography in selected populations. Our goal was to prospectively compare cancer detection of digital mammography (DM), whole-breast ultrasound (WBUS), and contrast-enhanced MRI in a high-risk screening population previously screened negative by film screen mammogram (FSM). METHODS: During a 2-year period, 609 asymptomatic high-risk women with nonactionable FSM examinations presented for a prospective multimodality screening consisting of DM, WBUS, and MRI. The FSM examinations were reinterpreted by study radiologists. Patients had benign or no suspicious findings on clinical examination. The cancer yield by modality was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty cancers were diagnosed in 18 patients (nine ductal carcinomas in situ and 11 invasive breast cancers). The overall cancer yield on a per-patient basis was 3.0% (18 of 609 patients). The cancer yield by modality was 1.0% for FSM (six of 597 women), 1.2% for DM (seven of 569 women), 0.53% for WBUS (three of 567 women), and 2.1% for MRI (12 of 571 women). Of the 20 cancers detected, some were only detected on one imaging modality (FSM, n = 1; DM, n = 3; WBUS, n = 1; and MRI, n = 8). CONCLUSION: The addition of MRI to mammography in the high-risk group has the greatest potential to detect additional mammographically occult cancers. The incremental cancer yield of WBUS and DM is much less.</docText>

        <docTitle>Computerized Image-Based Detection and Grading of Lymphocytic Infiltration in HER2+ Breast Cancer Histopathology.</docTitle>
        <docText>Computerized Image-Based Detection and Grading of Lymphocytic Infiltration in HER2+ Breast Cancer Histopathology.

The identification of phenotypic changes in breast cancer (BC) histopathology on account of corresponding molecular changes is of significant clinical importance in predicting disease outcome. One such example is the presence of lymphocytic infiltration (LI) in histopathology, which has been correlated with nodal metastasis and distant recurrence in HER2+ BC patients. In this paper we present a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) scheme to automatically detect and grade the extent of LI in digitized HER2+ BC histopathology. Lymphocytes are first automatically detected by a combination of region growing and Markov Random Field algorithms. Using the centers of individual detected lymphocytes as vertices, three graphs (Voronoi Diagram, Delaunay Triangulation, and Minimum Spanning Tree) are constructed and a total of 50 image-derived features describing the arrangement of the lymphocytes are extracted from each sample. A non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme, Graph Embedding, is then used to project the high-dimensional feature vector into a reduced 3D embedding space. A Support Vector Machine classifier is used to discriminate samples with high and low LI in the reduced dimensional embedding space. A total of 41 HER2+ hematoxylin &amp; eosin stained images obtained from 12 patients were considered in this study. Over 100 3-fold cross-validation trials, the architectural feature set successfully distinguished samples of high and low LI levels with a classification accuracy greater than 90%. The popular unsupervised Varma-Zisserman (VZ) texton-based classification scheme was used for comparison and yielded a classification accuracy of only 60%. Additionally, the projection of the 50 image-derived features for all 41 tissue samples into a reduced dimensional space via Graph Embedding allowed for the visualization of a smooth manifold which revealed a continuum between low, intermediate, and high levels of LI. Since it is known that extent of LI in BC biopsy specimens is a prognostic indicator, our CADx scheme will potentially help clinicians determine disease outcome and allow them to make better therapy recommendations for patients with HER2+ BC.</docText>

        <docText>Metronomic administration of pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin in extensively pre-treated metastatic breast cancer patients: A mono-institutional case-series report.

BACKGROUND: Metronomic chemotherapy has shown efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin (PLD) pharmacokinetic characteristics support the rationale for using the drug in a metronomic fashion, potentially able to combine anthracyclines efficacy to a low toxicity profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a case-series report carried out in both anthracycline-naive and pre-treated metastatic breast cancer patients, we tested feasibility, clinical efficacy and tolerability of PLD administered with a novel metronomic schedule of 20mg/m(2) i.v. every two weeks. RESULTS: 52 patients were enrolled and 45 were evaluated. Forty-four patients were assessed for either response or toxicity. Eight patients (18%) had partial responses (PR) and 17 (39%) stable disease (SD), with a clinical benefit (CB) of 45% (95% CI: 30.3%-59.7%). Nineteen patients (43%) had progressive disease (PD). Neither grade 3 nor grade 4 haematological or clinical side effects were recorded, except for 2 patients with grade 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). No cardiac toxicity was recorded. CONCLUSION: Metronomic administration of PLD is a feasible and active treatment for extensively pre-treated metastatic breast cancer patients, alternative to classic anthracyclines, balancing clinical efficacy with a good quality of life in terms of reduced side effects and low personal costs for the patient.</docText>

        <docText>Attitudes of Canadian Radiation Oncologists towards Post-lumpectomy Radiotherapy for Elderly Women with Stage I Hormone-responsive Breast Cancer.

AIMS: Post-lumpectomy breast radiation is the standard of care for all patient subgroups. However, elderly women with stage I breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen therapy have a 4% risk of local recurrence after lumpectomy without adjuvant breast radiation. The purpose of this study was to explore the attitudes of Canadian radiation oncologists who treat breast cancer with respect to their use of adjuvant post-lumpectomy radiotherapy, and their willingness to implement a decision aid for this patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The questionnaire was mailed to 141 Canadian radiation oncologists who treat breast cancer. The respondents were asked to complete an online survey consisting of four parts: (1) demographic information; (2) factors determining post-lumpectomy radiation treatment decisions; (3) hypothetical case scenarios; (4) interest in using a decision aid in their practice. RESULTS: Among the 61 (43%) physicians who completed the survey, there was substantial response variation. After contraindications to radiotherapy, patient overall health and patient preference had the greatest influence on their decision to offer radiotherapy to this patient subgroup. Margin status and use of hormonal therapy were given less importance. For each of the case scenarios, 60-83% of physicians (depending on the case scenario) would offer the patient a choice; far fewer (12-57%) would be comfortable not irradiating. Sixty-four per cent of respondents welcomed the concept of a decision aid for this population. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is significant variation in practice patterns and attitudes among radiation oncologists regarding post-lumpectomy radiotherapy for elderly, low-risk breast cancer patients, the vast majority value patient choice and would be willing to use a decision aid designed for this population in their practice.</docText>

INTRODUCTION: The use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has increased in the treatment of loco-regionally advanced primarily operable breast cancer. As a result of improved neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimes the number of clinical as well as radiological responses have increased. In case of a complete response it is difficult to identify residual disease and to perform an adequate radical breast-conserving surgery. Therefore localization of the original tumour bed is mandatory. In this study we propose a novel technique with a seed containing radioactive 125 Iodine ((125)I). The (125)I has a half-time of 60 days and is therefore still recognisable with a gamma probe after admittance of several courses of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period from July 2003 and November 2008, 47 consecutive patients had successful (125)I seed localization of a breast tumour before starting neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall clinical response rate to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was 100%. Complete clinical response occurred in 34 patients, partial clinical response occurred in 13 patients. Complete radiological response occurred in 18 patients, partial radiological response occurred in 29 patients. The initial surgical treatment consisted of breast-conserving surgery for all 47 patients, after a mean of 170 days (range: 70-220) after (125)I seed localization. In 19 patients pathology revealed no residual tumour, 23 patients showed a partial response. Only 3 lumpectomies were irradical. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that (125)I seed localization is a novel and highly successful technique in localizing the tumour bed in patients who receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer leading to a high percentage of radical margins in case of breast-conserving surgery.</docText>

        <docText>Evidence-based care for breast cancer survivors: Communicating the Institute of Medicine Guidelines in medical practice.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient reports of physician communication about the 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Guidelines for Survivorship Care, and patient follow-up care behaviors in a sample of African American and Caucasian breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Fifteen-minute telephone interviews were conducted in a cross-sectional study with a sample of African American (n=30) and Caucasian (n=69) breast cancer patients, who were within 5 years of their diagnosis and primary treatment for breast cancer at two Baltimore, Maryland medical centers, during the summer of 2006. Multiple items assessed patient reports of physician discussions about IOM Guidelines, their recurrence concerns, and their follow-up treatment, screening, diet and exercise practices. RESULTS: Patients with higher incomes, more education, female physicians, and of younger ages reported more complete physician discussions of the IOM Guidelines. No significant differences were noted between African American and Caucasian patients. CONCLUSION: Patients at greatest risk for breast cancer recurrence - those with less education, income, and resources - report limited guidance from their physicians about evidence-based, follow-up care guidelines, designed to minimize their risk. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians need strategies for effectively delivering the IOM Guidelines for Survivorship Care to disadvantaged breast cancer patients, to promote enhanced quality of life and reduced risk of recurrence.</docText>

        <docText>Novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Metastatic breast cancer is ultimately an incurable disease, although recent data have shown that its incidence is decreasing and that patients with metastatic breast cancer live longer. This improvement in survival seems to be linked with the introduction of new therapeutic agents, novel combinations of existing therapies and targeted therapies. Our increasing understanding of the molecular biology of metastatic disease has allowed the development of therapies aimed at specific molecular targets. Some of these have already been approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cytotoxics, and others have shown promising results regarding disease-free survival, overall response rates and time to disease progression. Given the enormous amount of information about drug discovery in cancer, it is important to be familiar with the present state of the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the development of some of the most promising novel agents and treatment strategies in metastatic breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Self-Assembly of phospholipid-analogous hyperbranched polymers nanomicelles for drug delivery.

A drug nanocarrier has been constructed through self-assembly of phospholipid analogous hyperbranched polymers (HPHEEP-alkyls) which contain a polar hyperbranched polyphosphate headgroup and many aliphatic tails. HPHEEP-alkyls were synthesized by self-condensing ring-opening polymerization of 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane and then capped with palmitoyl chloride. Benefiting from the amphiphilic structure with the hydrophilic core and many hydrophobic tails, HPHEEP-alkyls were able to self-assemble into nanomicelles in aqueous media. Importantly, the size of the nanomicelles could be controlled conveniently from 98 to 215nm by adjusting the capped fraction of the hydroxyl groups with hydrophobic palmityls. The excellent biocompatibility of these nanomicelles was confirmed by methyl tetrazolium assay and acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining against COS-7 cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated their good cell permeability, i.e. these nanomicelles were easily internalized by vivid cells and mainly located in the cytoplasm rather than nucleolus. Chlorambucil-loaded nanomicelles were investigated for proliferation inhibition of a MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in vitro, and the chlorambucil dose required for 50% cellular growth inhibition was found to be 5mug/mL. All of these results indicate that HPHEEP-alkyls nanomicelles can be used as safe and promising drug nanocarriers.</docText>

        <docText>Breast cancer aromatase expression evaluated by the novel antibody 677: Correlations to intra-tumor estrogen levels and hormone receptor status.

Breast cancer tissue estrogen levels on an average exceed plasma as well as benign breast tissue levels. To evaluate the contribution of intra-tumor aromatization to individual tumor estrogen levels (estradiol, E(2)/estrone, E(1)/estrone sulfate, and E(1)S), breast cancer tissue sections obtained during mastectomy in 28 postmenopausal breast cancer patients were stained for aromatase protein expression using the aromatase antibody 677. The findings were correlated to intra-tumor estrogen levels determined with a highly sensitive HPLC-RIA. Staining with 677 alone (irrespective of the hormone receptor status) revealed no difference in tumor E(2) levels comparing 677+ versus 677- tumors, although a non-significant trend towards higher tumor E(1) and E(1)S levels was observed in 677+ breast cancers. In contrast, tumor levels of E(2) were significantly higher in ER+ tumors compared to ERER- tumors (P&lt;0.001) and to benign breast tissue from the same breast (P&lt;0.001). Analysing the additional effect of 677 positivity on tumor estrogen levels in the subgroup of ER+ tumors, revealed significantly higher tumor levels of E(2) (mean level of 544.7 versus 197.1fmol/g tissue) as well as a non-significant trend concerning tumor E(1) (mean level of 296.9 versus 102.1fmol/g tissue). The mean tumor tissue E(1)S level was observed somewhat lower in ER+677+ (103.5fmol/g) versus ER+677- tumors (190.1fmol/g). In the subgroup of ER+PgR+ tumors, tissue levels of E(2) were also found to be significantly higher among 677+ compared to 677- tumors: 873.2fmol/g (95% CI 395.9-1925.6) versus 217.9fmol/g (95% CI 88.8-534.9) (P=0.015). In conclusion, our results indicate a moderate effect of aromatase enzyme expression evaluated by IHC using the antibody 677 on intra-tumor estrogen levels among ER+ breast cancers. A substantial interindividual variation in the ratios between the individual estrogen fractions suggests additional effects, like alterations in other enzymes to be involved in the intra-tumor estrogen homeostasis.</docText>

        <docText>Theaflavins retard human breast cancer cell migration by inhibiting NF-kappaB via p53-ROS cross-talk.

The present study demonstrates that theaflavins exploit p53 to impede metastasis in human breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that p53-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce p53-phosphorylation via p38MAPK in a feedback loop to inhibit IkappaBalpha-phosphorylation and NF-kappaB/p65 nuclear translocation, thereby down-regulating the metastatic proteins metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. When wild-type p53-expressing MCF-7 cells are transfected with p53 short-interfering RNA, or treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of ROS, theaflavins fail to inhibit NF-kappaB-mediated cell migration. On the other hand, NF-kappaB over-expression bestows MCF-7 cells with resistance to the anti-migratory effect of theaflavins. These results indicate that inhibition of NF-kappaB via p53-ROS crosstalk is a pre-requisite for theaflavins to accomplish the anti-migratory effect in breast cancer cells.

        <docText>Involvement of miR-326 in chemotherapy resistance of breast cancer through modulating expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1.

Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP-1/ABCC1) transports a wide range of therapeutic agents and may play a critical role in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumor cells. However, the regulation of MRP-1 remains controversial. To explore whether miRNAs are involved in the regulation of MRP-1 expression and modulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents, we analyzed miRNA expression levels in VP-16-resistant MDR cell line, MCF-7/VP, in comparison with its parent cell line, MCF-7, using a miRNA microarray. MCF-7/VP overexpressed MRP-1 mRNA and protein not MDR-1 and BCRP. miR-326 was downregulated in MCF-7/VP compared to MCF-7. Additionally, miR-326 was downregulated in a panel of advanced breast cancer tissues and consistent reversely with expression levels of MRP-1. Furthermore, the elevated levels of miR-326 in the mimics-transfected VP-16-resistant cell line, MCF-7/VP, downregulated MRP-1 expression and sensitized these cells to VP-16 and doxorubicin. These findings demonstrate for the first time the involvement of miRNAs in multidrug resistance mediated by MRP-1 and suggest that miR-326 may be an efficient agent for preventing and reversing MDR in tumor cells.</docText>

        <docText>Self-Affirmation Enhances Attentional Bias Toward Threatening Components of a Persuasive Message.

ABSTRACT- We explored whether self-affirmation enhances attentional bias toward threatening elements of a persuasive message. Female alcohol consumers read an article linking alcohol to breast cancer and were then exposed supraliminally to threat and nonthreat words from the article (as well as threat and nonthreat words that did not appear in the article). Among moderately heavy drinkers who were not self-affirmed, there emerged an attentional bias away from the threatening words in the article-a result suggesting an avoidant response. However, among moderately heavy drinkers who were self-affirmed, there was a bias toward the threatening words. No attentional biases appeared for threat words not in the message, which suggested that the effect was threat specific. Moreover, no attentional biases were found among the heaviest drinkers. Self-affirmation may facilitate targeted implicit processing of threatening messages, although the effects could attenuate among individuals engaging in high levels of the behavior featured in the message.</docText>

        <docText>In situ estrogen production and its regulation in human breast carcinoma: from endocrinology to intracrinology.

The great majority of breast carcinomas arising in postmenopausal women are estrogen dependent or positive for estrogen receptor (ER) in carcinoma cells despite markedly low plasma or circulating estrogen concentrations. In these patients, biologically active estrogens are locally produced from circulating inactive steroids including adrenal androgens in an intracrine mechanism in the breast cancer tissues and confer estrogenic activities on carcinoma cells. A series of enzymes are involved in this intra-tumoral or in situ production of estrogens in breast carcinoma tissues but aromatase, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, is a key enzyme of estrogen production through conversion from circulating adrenal androgens in estrogen-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer. It then becomes important to identify the sites of this estrogen production. There has been, however, controversy regarding intra-tumoral localization of aromatase in breast carcinoma, especially whether intra-tumoral production of estrogens through aromatase occurs in carcinoma or stromal cells. The enzyme was demonstrated to be expressed in both carcinoma and stromal cells in breast carcinoma tissues on immunohistochemistry with a well-characterized mAb 677 and combined laser capture microdissection/qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Intra-tumoral aromatase in both of these cell types was subsequently demonstrated to be induced by carcinoma-stromal interactions associated with carcinoma invasion in breast tissue. The signals through various nuclear receptors, especially estrogen-related receptor-alpha in carcinoma cells and liver receptor homologue-1 in adipocytes adjacent to carcinoma invasion, in conjunction with various cytokines and/or growth factors, play pivotal roles in this induction of intra-tumoral aromatase. This increased aromatase subsequently results in increased in situ estrogen concentrations of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are currently established as the gold standard for the treatment for ER-positive breast carcinoma but resistance to the therapy still remains to be solved by other modes of suppression of intra-tumoral estrogen production.</docText>

        <docText>Knockdown of OLA1, a regulator of oxidative stress response, inhibits motility and invasion of breast cancer cells.

To explore the role of a novel Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1) in cancer metastasis, small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown the protein, and the cells were subjected to in vitro cell migration and invasion assays. Knockdown of OLA1 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. The knockdown caused no changes in cell growth but affected ROS production. In wound-healing assays, decreased ROS in OLA1-knockdown cells were in situ associated with the cells' decreased motile morphology. Further, treatment of N-acetylcysteine, a general ROS scavenger, blunted the motility and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, similar to the effect of OLA1-knockdown. These results suggest that knockdown of OLA1 inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves the modulation of intracellular ROS levels.</docText>

        <docText>Premature mortality due to cancer in Japan, 1995 and 2005.

To better understand premature mortality due to cancer, we estimated years of life lost (YLL) and average years of life lost (AYLL) due to cancer for the years 1995 and 2005, based on data from the Vital Statistic of Japan. In men, we identified a total of 159,623 cancer deaths in 1995 and 196,603 in 2005. Total YLL were 2,342,560.4 and 2,724,066.0 years, respectively. Averaged for all cancers, people died 14.7 years earlier than life expectancy in 1995, and 13.9 years in 2005. AYLL was longest for brain cancer deaths, at 26.3 years earlier than expected in 1995 and 22.8 years in 2005, followed by leukemia. In women, a total of 103,399 cancer deaths occurred in 1995 and 129,338 in 2005. Total YLL were 1,818,960.4 years in 1995 and 2,160,706.5 years in 2005, corresponding to AYLL for all cancer combined of 17.6 and 16.7 years. The AYLL of brain cancer deaths was also the longest, at 29.4 years in 1995 and 27.8 in 2005, followed by leukemia and female sex-related cancers. Results showed that cancer of the stomach, colorectum, liver, and lung were the most frequent cancers in both sexes in both 1995 and 2005, and responsible for a remarkable number of YLL. Further, AYLL was greatest for brain cancer and leukemia in both sexes, and for sex-related cancers in women, namely breast, cervix, and ovarian cancer. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docText>Relationship between anticancer activity and stereochemistry of saldach ligands and their iron(III) complexes.

(R,R)-, (S,S)- and (R,S)-N,N'-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (saldach) and their iron(III) complexes were screened for anticancer activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer as well as HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. Antiproliferative effects depended on the presence of the central atom iron but were independent on the configuration at the saldach ligand. While the free ligands were inactive, the iron(III) derivatives displayed anticancer activity within a concentration range of 1 to 5 microM irrespective of the used cell line. At 5 microM they were even more active than cis-platin. A mode of action comparable to cis-platin can be excluded because it is very likely that the DNA is not the primary target of [Fe(III) (saldach)] complexes.</docText>

The growth of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cells is inhibited by the pineal gland hormone, melatonin. Concern has been raised that power-line frequency and microwave electromagnetic fields (EMFs) could reduce the efficiency of melatonin on breast cancer cells. In this study we investigated the impact of EMFs on the signal transduction of the high-affinity receptor MT1 in parental MCF-7 cells and MCF-7 cells transfected with the MT1 gene. The binding of the cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein to a promoter sequence of BRCA-1 after stimulation with melatonin was analyzed by a gel-shift assay and the expression of four estrogen-responsive genes was measured in sham-exposed breast cancer cells and cells exposed to a sinusoidal 50 Hz EMF of 1.2 microT for 48 h. In sham-exposed cells, binding of CREB to the promoter of BRCA-1 was increased by estradiol and subsequently diminished by treatment with melatonin. In cells exposed to 1.2 microT, 50 Hz EMF, binding of CREB was almost completely omitted. Expression of BRCA-1, p53, p21(WAF), and c-myc was increased by estradiol stimulation and subsequently decreased by melatonin treatment in both cell lines, except for p53 expression in the transfected cell line, thereby proving the antiestrogenic effect of melatonin at molecular level. In contrast, in breast cancer cells transfected with MT1 exposed to 1.2 microT of the 50 Hz EMF, the expression of p53 and c-myc increased significantly after melatonin treatment but for p21(WAF) the increase was not significant. These results convincingly prove the negative effect of EMF on the antiestrogenic effect of melatonin in breast cancer cells. Bioelectromagnetics, 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</docText>

        <docText>Cancer screening practices among racially and ethnically diverse breast cancer survivors: results from the 2001 and 2003 California Health Interview Survey.

INTRODUCTION: Women treated for breast cancer are at increased risk for developing second or new cancers. This study examined behavioral and health care utilization practices associated with screening behaviors for mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap), home fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, proctoscopy) among racially and ethnically diverse female breast cancer survivors (BCS) and women without a cancer history. METHODS: Data from the 2001 and 2003 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a random-digit dial population-based survey of adult respondents was used to examine self-reported screening practices of BCS (n = 1,502) and women without a cancer history (n = 31,911). RESULTS: Compared to women without a cancer history, BCS reported more recent screening for all tests. Among BCS, Hispanics reported lowest screening for routine mammography (84.2% versus 68.9%; P &lt; 0.05) but highest screening for Pap test (95.4% versus 85.4%; P &gt; 0.01). White and Asian BCS reported more endoscopic examinations (58.9% versus 46.5%; P &lt; 0.001; 61.2% versus 38.4%; P &lt; 0.05) than the comparison population. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and health status differences, screening rates for BCS showed higher mammography use (odds ratio [OR] 1.97; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.58-2.46), Pap test (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.22-1.70), and endoscopic use (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.16-1.58), but not higher for FOBT. CONCLUSIONS: Even though BCS generally had higher cancer screening rates than women without a cancer history, racial/ethnic differences exist among the type of test received. Narrowing these differences is essential to lessen disparities. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The need for screening guidelines for BCS remains a high priority. Survivors would benefit from the frequency of screening for all cancers post-treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Immunohistochemical Detection of Phospho-Akt, Phospho-BAD, HER2 and Oestrogen Receptors alpha and beta in Malaysian Breast Cancer Patients.

Activation of Akt signaling pathway has been documented in various human malignancies, including breast carcinoma. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of Akt phosphorylation in breast tumours and its relationship with expression of ER-alpha, ER-beta, HER2, Ki-67 and phosphorylated Bcl-2 associated death domain (p-BAD). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect these molecules on 43 paraffin-embedded breast tumour tissues with commercially available antibodies. Eighteen (41.9%), 3 (7.0%), 23 (53.5%), 35 (81.4%), 21 (48.8%), 29 (67.4%), and 34 (81.0%) of breast tumours were positive for nuclear ER-alpha, nuclear ER-beta, membranous HER2, cytonuclear p-Akt (Thr308), p-Akt (Ser473), p-BAD and Ki-67, respectively. ER-alpha expression was inversely correlated with HER2 and Ki-67 (P = 0.041 and P = 0.040, respectively). The p-Akt (Ser473) was correlated with increased level of p-BAD (Ser136) (P = 0.012). No relationship of Akt phosphorylation with HER2, ER-alpha or ER-beta was found. The p-Akt (Ser473) immunoreactivity was significantly higher in stage IV than in stage I or II (P = 0.036 or P = 0.009). The higher Ki-67 and lower ER-alpha expression showed an association with patient age of &lt;50 years (P = 0.004) and with positive nodal status (P = 0.033), respectively. Our data suggest that the Akt phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream target, BAD may play a role in survival of breast cancer cell. This study does not support the simple model of linear HER2/PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>TGFBR1*6A/9A polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 13,662 cases and 14,147 controls.

Published data on the association between TGFBR1*6A/9A polymorphism and cancer risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 32 studies including 13,662 cases and 14,147 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, significantly elevated cancer risks were associated with TGFBR1*6A in all genetic models (for allelic effect: OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.03-1.21; for 6A/6A vs. 9A/9A: OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.01-1.69; for 9A/6A vs. 9A/9A: OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.01-1.15; for dominant model: OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.15; for recessive model: OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.00-1.68). In the subgroup analysis by cancer types, significant associations were found in breast cancer (for allelic effect: OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.01-1.34) and ovarian cancer (for allelic effect: OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.00-1.54; for 6A/6A vs. 9A/9A: OR = 2.34; 95% CI = 1.03-5.33). However, no significant associations were found in colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer for all genetic models. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that the TGFBR1*6A/9A polymorphism is associated with cancer susceptibility, increasing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time of breast cancer survivors, and associations with adiposity: findings from NHANES (2003-2006).

OBJECTIVE: Obesity and physical inactivity are poor prognostic indicators for breast cancer. Studies to date have relied on self-report measures of physical activity, which tend mainly to assess moderate-to-vigorous intensity leisure-time physical activity. We report the cross-sectional associations of objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary time with adiposity in a sample of breast cancer survivors from the United States. METHODS: One hundred and eleven women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 reported a history of breast cancer. Participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days, and activity levels were summarized as moderate-to-vigorous intensity (accelerometer counts/min &gt;/=1,952), light intensity (counts/min 100-1,951), and sedentary time (counts/min &lt;100). Anthropometric measures were taken by study staff at examination centers. RESULTS: Participants spent the majority of their day in sedentary time (66%) or in light intensity activities (33%). Log moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was negatively associated with adiposity (waist circumference beta = -9.805 [95% CI: -15.836, -3.775]; BMI beta = -3.576 [95% CI: -6.687, -0.464]). Light intensity physical activity was negatively associated with adiposity; however, the fully adjusted models did not retain statistical significance. Similarly, sedentary time was positively associated with adiposity, but the fully adjusted models were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary time of breast cancer survivors. Increasing moderate-to-vigorous and light intensity physical activity, and decreasing sedentary time, may assist with weight management and improve other metabolic health outcomes for breast cancer survivors.</docText>

        <docText>BRCA1 transcriptionally regulates genes associated with the basal-like phenotype in breast cancer.

Expression profiling of BRCA1-deficient tumours has identified a pattern of gene expression similar to basal-like breast tumours. In this study, we examine whether a BRCA1-dependent transcriptional mechanism may underpin the link between BRCA1 and basal-like phenotype. In methods section, the mRNA and protein were harvested from a number of BRCA1 mutant and wild-type breast cancer cell lines and from matched isogenic controls. Microarray-based expression profiling was used to identify potential BRCA1-regulated transcripts. These gene targets were then validated (by in silico analysis of tumour samples) by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to confirm recruitment of BRCA1 to specific promoters. In results, we demonstrate that functional BRCA1 represses the expression of cytokeratins 5(KRT5) and 17(KRT17) and p-Cadherin (CDH3) in HCC1937 and T47D breast cancer cell lines at both mRNA and protein level. ChIP assays demonstrate that BRCA1 is recruited to the promoters of KRT5, KRT17 and CDH3, and re-ChIP assays confirm that BRCA1 is recruited independently to form c-Myc and Sp1 complexes on the CDH3 promoter. We show that siRNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous c-Myc (and not Sp1) results in a marked increase in CDH3 expression analogous to that observed following the inhibition of endogenous BRCA1. The data provided suggest a model whereby BRCA1 and c-Myc form a repressor complex on the promoters of specific basal genes and represent a potential mechanism to explain the observed overexpression of key basal markers in BRCA1-deficient tumours.</docText>

        <docText>Metabolic profile, physical activity, and mortality in breast cancer patients.

Metabolic components [body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, serum lipids] and physical activity may affect biological mechanisms of importance for breast cancer prognosis. A population-based survival study among 1,364 breast cancer cases within the Norwegian Counties Study during 1974-2005 was conducted. Pre-diagnostic measurements of BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, and self-reported physical activity were assessed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used in analyses (SAS version 9.11). Among these breast cancer cases (age at diagnosis 27-79 years), 429 women died (8.2 mean follow-up years). Those with a BMI &gt;/= 30 kg/m(2) had a 1.47 higher risk of dying during follow-up than women with a BMI of 18.5-25 kg/m(2) [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.47, 95% CI 1.08-1.99]. Women with BMI &lt; 25 kg/m(2) and age of diagnosis &gt;/=55 years had a 66% reduction in overall mortality if they regularly exercised before diagnosis compared with sedentary women (HR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71). Women in the highest tertile of total cholesterol had a 29% increase in mortality compared to women in the lowest tertile (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.64). Additionally, women in the highest tertile of blood pressure had a 41% increase in mortality compared to women in the lowest tertile of blood pressure (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83). Our study supports a relationship between mortality not only in relation to BMI, but also blood pressure, lipids, and physical activity among breast cancer patients. These factors may all be important targets for invention among breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>A glycomics approach to the discovery of potential cancer biomarkers.

Glycosylation is highly sensitive to the biochemical environment and plays a key role in development and disease manifestation. Moreover, glycan biosynthesis depends on several highly competitive processes; thus, variations in the concentration of specific glycosyltransferases produce different products. For this reason, monitoring changes in glycosylation may be a more specific and sensitive approach to biomarker discovery and possibly disease diagnosis. Glycans in serum are of particular interest as approximately half of all proteins are glycosylated. We have developed the methods for profiling the glycans in human serum to identify glycan biomarker. Global release methods were used including chemical and enzymatic to access O-linked and N-linked glycans, respectively. Glycans were released from the culture medium of various cancer cell lines, in control sera, and in cancer patients and isolated using solid phase extraction (SPE) with a porous graphitized carbon. The SPE fractions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI FTICR MS). Glycan compositions were determined based on accurate masses and tandem mass spectrometry. Glycosylation changes between control and patient group were monitored. Several glycans were identified as potential markers for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer. In short, direct glycan analysis of human serum without any protein identification represents a new and innovative approach to disease marker discovery.</docText>

        <docText>Heterogeneity of adenosine triphosphate-based chemotherapy response assay in colorectal cancer--secondary publication.

PURPOSE: Adenosine triphosphate-based chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA) is a well-documented and validated technology that can individualize chemotherapy for patients with lung, stomach, or breast cancer. This study explored the feasibility of ATP-CRA as a chemosensitivity test in patients with colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 118 patients who underwent surgical resection for colorectal adenocarcinoma were analyzed for chemosensitivity to 6 anticancer drugs using ATP-CRA. We calculated the cell death rate (CDR) by measuring intracellular ATP levels of drug-exposed cells and untreated controls. RESULTS: Interpretable results were available for 85.5% (118/138) of patients. The mean coefficient of variation for triplicate ATP measurements was 9.2%. The highest CDR was observed in irinotecan (34.0%) and the lowest CDR in etoposide (21.0%). Paclitaxel had the broadest range of CDR (0-86.7%) and 5-FU had the narrowest range of CDR (0-56.8%). The overall highest responsiveness was seen most prevalently in irinotecan (24.7%, 23/93 patients). Irinotecan had the greatest responsiveness in patients with well differentiated and moderately differentiated carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that ATP-CRA could be used to identify patients with colorectal cancer who might benefit from treatment with a specific chemotherapeutic agent.</docText>

        <docText>Proteomic identification of putative biomarkers of radiotherapy resistance: a possible role for the 26S proteasome?

PURPOSE: We aimed to identify putative predictive protein biomarkers of radioresistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and T47D) were used as in vitro models to study radioresistance. Inherent radiosensitivities were examined using a clonogenic survival assay. It was revealed that each cell line differed in their response to radiotherapy. These parental breast cancer cell lines were used to establish novel derivatives (MCF7RR, MDA-MB-231RR, and T47DRR) displaying significant resistance to ionizing radiation. Derivative cells were compared with parental cells to identify putative biomarkers associated with the radioresistant phenotype. To identify these biomarkers, complementary proteomic screening approaches were exploited encompassing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and quantitative proteomics using iTRAQ technology. RESULTS: A large number of potential biomarkers were identified, and several of these were confirmed using Western blot analysis. In particular, a decrease in the expression of the 26S proteasome was found in all radioresistant derivatives when compared with the respective parent cells. Decreased expression of this target was also found to be associated with radioresistant laryngeal tumors (P = .05) in a small pilot immunohistochemical study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the 26S proteasome may provide a general predictive biomarker for radiotherapy outcome.</docText>

        <docText>Chaperone-targeting cytotoxin and endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing drug synergize to kill cancer cells.

Diverse physiological and therapeutic insults that increase the amount of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce the unfolded protein response, an evolutionarily conserved protective mechanism that manages ER stress. Glucose-regulated protein 78/immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (GRP78/BiP) is an ER-resident protein that plays a central role in the ER stress response and is the only known substrate of the proteolytic A subunit (SubA) of a novel bacterial AB(5) toxin. Here, we report that an engineered fusion protein, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-SubA, combining EGF and SubA, is highly toxic to growing and confluent epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing cancer cells, and its cytotoxicity is mediated by a remarkably rapid cleavage of GRP78/BiP. Systemic delivery of EGF-SubA results in a significant inhibition of human breast and prostate tumor xenografts in mouse models. Furthermore, EGF-SubA dramatically increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to the ER stress-inducing drug thapsigargin, and vice versa, demonstrating the first example of mechanism-based synergism in the action of a cytotoxin and an ER-targeting drug.</docText>

Women outlive men, but life expectancy is not influenced by hormone replacement (estrogen + progestin) therapy. Estrogens appear to protect brain, cardiovascular tissues, and bone from aging. Estrogens regulate genes directly through binding to estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta) that are ligand-activated transcription factors and indirectly by activating plasma membrane-associated ER which, in turns, activates intracellular signaling cascades leading to altered gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (19-25 nucleotides), naturally-occurring, non-coding RNA molecules that base-pair with the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. This interaction either blocks translation of the mRNA or targets the mRNA transcript to be degraded. The human genome contains ~ 700-1,200 miRNAs. Aberrant patterns of miRNA expression are implicated in human diseases including breast cancer. Recent studies have identified miRNAs regulated by estrogens in human breast cancer cells, human endometrial stromal and myometrial smooth muscle cells, rat mammary gland, and mouse uterus. The decline of estradiol levels in postmenopausal women has been implicated in various age-associated disorders. The role of estrogen-regulated miRNA expression, the target genes of these miRNAs, and the role of miRNAs in aging has yet to be explored.</docText>

        <docText>Partial Correlation Estimation by Joint Sparse Regression Models.

In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient approach -space(Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation)- for selecting non-zero partial correlations under the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting. This method assumes the overall sparsity of the partial correlation matrix and employs sparse regression techniques for model fitting. We illustrate the performance of space by extensive simulation studies. It is shown that space performs well in both non-zero partial correlation selection and the identification of hub variables, and also outperforms two existing methods. We then apply space to a microarray breast cancer data set and identify a set of hub genes which may provide important insights on genetic regulatory networks. Finally, we prove that, under a set of suitable assumptions, the proposed procedure is asymptotically consistent in terms of model selection and parameter estimation.</docText>

        <docTitle>Focal amplification and oncogene dependency of GAB2 in breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Focal amplification and oncogene dependency of GAB2 in breast cancer.

DNA amplifications in breast cancer are frequent on chromosome 11q, in which multiple driver oncogenes likely reside in addition to cyclin D1 (CCND1). One such candidate, the scaffolding adapter protein, GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), functions in ErbB signaling and was recently shown to enhance mammary epithelial cell proliferation, and metastasis of ERBB2 (HER2/neu)-driven murine breast cancer. However, the amplification status and function of GAB2 in the context of amplification remain undefined. In this study, by genomic profiling of 172 breast tumors, and fluorescence in situ hybridization validation in an independent set of 210 scorable cases, we observed focal amplification spanning GAB2 (11q14.1) independent of CCND1 (11q13.2) amplification, consistent with a driver role. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of GAB2 in breast cancer lines (SUM52, SUM44PE and MDA468) with GAB2 amplification revealed a dependency on GAB2 for cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, survival and invasion, likely mediated through altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. GAB2 knockdown also reduced proliferation and survival in a cell line (BT474) with ERBB2 amplification, consistent with the possibility that GAB2 can function downstream of ERBB2. Our studies implicate focal amplification of GAB2 in breast carcinogenesis, and underscore an oncogenic role of scaffolding adapter proteins, and a potential new point of therapeutic intervention.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.364.</docText>

        <docText>BAG-1 overexpression attenuates luminal apoptosis in MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells through enhanced RAF-1 activation.

Although the multi-functional, prosurvival protein, Bcl-2-associated anthanogene 1 (BAG-1) is frequently overexpressed in breast cancers, its role in the development or maintenance of the malignant state remains unclear. Here, we have used the established MCF-10A 3-dimensional (3D) model of mammary morphogenesis as a biologically relevant system to determine how BAG-1 expression may influence the development of breast cancer. When cultured in 3D, MCF-10A cells undergo a highly regulated morphogenic program leading to the development of polarized acinar structures containing a central, hollow lumen formed, in part, through the induction of BIM-dependent apoptosis. BAG-1 overexpression resulted in an attenuation of this normal apoptotic program characterized by a significantly increased number of acini with filled lumens-a phenotype commonly observed in ductal carcinoma in situ. BAG-1's effects were associated with an activation of RAF-1-a known binding partner of BAG-1, enhanced signaling through the MAP kinase pathway and a decrease in BIM expression. Reversal of the BAG-1-associated survival phenotype by the mitogen-activated kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, U0126, implicates the RAF-1-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway as a major mediator of BAG-1's effects in this model. As BAG-1 expression is often elevated in preinvasive breast cancers, these findings support a possible role for BAG-1 as an early contributor to the malignant process in the breast.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.362.</docText>

        <docText>Wnt signaling activation and mammary gland hyperplasia in MMTV-LRP6 transgenic mice: implication for breast cancer tumorigenesis.

Although Wnt signaling activation is frequently observed in human breast cancer, mutations in genes encoding intracellular components of the Wnt signaling pathway are rare. We found that the expression of Wnt signaling co-receptor, LRP6, is upregulated in a subset of human breast cancer tissues and cell lines. To examine whether the overexpression of LRP6 in mammary epithelial cells is sufficient to activate Wnt signaling and promote cell proliferation, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing LRP6 in mammary epithelial cells driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. We found that mammary glands from MMTV-LRP6 mice exhibit significant Wnt activation evidenced by the translocation of beta-catenin from membrane to cytoplasmic/nuclear fractions. The expression of several Wnt target genes including Axin2, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc was also increased in MMTV-LRP6 mice. More importantly, mammary glands from virgin MMTV-LRP6 mice exhibit significant hyperplasia, a precursor to breast cancer, when compared with wild-type littermate controls. Several matrix metalloproteinases are upregulated in MMTV-LRP6 mice that could contribute to the hyperplasia phenotype. Our results suggest that Wnt signaling activation at the cell-surface receptor level can contribute to breast cancer tumorigenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 November 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.339.</docText>

        <docText>Estrogenic activity of xanthorrhizol isolated from curcuma xanthorrhiza ROXB.

Plant-derived estrogen-like compounds, or phytoestrogens, are given much attention due to their potential therapeutic use. In this study, xanthorrhizol, a natural sesquiterpenoid isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma xanthorrhiza ROXB. (Zingiberaceae), was evaluated for its estrogenic activity. It has been known that compounds acting as ligands for estrogen receptors (ERs) are considered to possess estrogenic activity. Therefore, the Gal-4/ER transactivation assay in transiently transfected African green monkey kidney (COS-7) cells was used to examine the estrogenic activity of xanthorrhizol. Both subtypes of ERs, ERalpha and ERbeta, were involved in this assay. Further transactivation assays and pS2 mRNA analysis were also conducted in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer (MCF-7). Our results showed that xanthorrhizol significantly increased Gal-4/ER luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner and induced the endogenous ER-estrogen response element (ERE) interaction in MCF-7 cells. Xanthorrhizol also significantly enhanced the expression of the pS2 gene in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, treatment using ICI 182780, an ER antagonist, suppressed all activities induced by xanthorrhizol, indicating ER-dependant activities were involved. These results suggest that xanthorrhizol possesses estrogenic activity and its estrogenic effects are mediated by estrogen-induced gene expression.</docText>

        <docText>How to improve your breast cancer program: Standardized reporting using the new American College of Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System.

In the USA, the use of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (ACR BI-RADS) has served not only as a quality assurance tool and guide to standardizing breast imaging reports but has also improved communication between referring physicians, researchers, and patients. In fact, in the USA, the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1997 requires that all mammograms be assigned a BI-RADS category based on the finding of most concern. In this manuscript, we aim to review the recommendations provided in the 4 th edition of the ACR BI-RADS for mammography, USG, and MRI. We also review the major controversies surrounding the use of ACR BI-RADS .</docText>

        <docText>MRI for breast cancer: Current indications.

Mammography is the only imaging study that has been proven in multiple large randomized trials to decrease breast cancer mortality. Mammography, however, has its limitations and, as such, other modalities that can complement it are being studied. One of these is dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI, which has emerged as an important adjunctive modality and is at present the most sensitive modality that we have to evaluate the breast. The American College of Radiology, in its 2004 practice guidelines, has outlined the 12 current indications for breast MRI. This manuscript reviews and provides examples of each of these.</docText>

        <docText>Field effect in cancer-an update.

The concept "field effect in cancer" originated in 1953 from the histopathological observations of Slaughter and colleagues [1] regarding the occurrence of multiple primary oral squamous cell carcinomas and their local recurrences. The development of modern molecular technologies has extended the field effect concept by exploring the molecular abnormalities in tissues that appear histologically normal. To date, such field effect biomarkers have been reported in several sites and organs, eg, head and neck, colon and rectum, prostate, breast, lung, esophagus, stomach, and skin. Two popular hypotheses have been proposed. One hypothesis implicates genetic alterations that occur in a stepwise fashion (initiation, promotion, and progression); a clone gains growth advantage and acquires more genetic alterations, which eventually result in cancer. A second hypothesis focuses on epigenetic alterations, which include hypermethylation of the DNA promoter of certain tumor suppressor genes, leading to down-regulation of these genes. In this update, we discuss in detail the evidence that supports these two hypotheses. In addition, we attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the field effect in carcinogenesis and its possible mechanisms in various organs. Moreover, we discuss the potential utilization of field effect biomarkers in cancer prevention, surgical considerations, and clinical prognosis.</docText>

        <docText>Gynecomastia: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management.

Gynecomastia, defined as benign proliferation of male breast glandular tissue, is usually caused by increased estrogen activity, decreased testosterone activity, or the use of numerous medications. Although a fairly common presentation in the primary care setting and mostly of benign etiology, it can cause patients considerable anxiety. The initial step is to rule out pseudogynecomastia by careful history taking and physical examination. A stepwise approach that includes imaging and laboratory testing to exclude neoplasms and endocrinopathies may facilitate cost-effective diagnosis. If results of all studies are normal, idiopathic gynecomastia is diagnosed. The evidence in this area is mainly of observational nature and lower quality.</docText>

        <docText>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor EnhancesCancer Cell Adhesion to Microvascular Endothelium in vivo.

To investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhances cancer cell adhesion to normal microvessels, we used in vivo video microscopy to measure adhesion rates of MDA-MB-435s human breast cancer cells and ErbB2-transformed mouse mammary carcinomas in the post-capillary venules of rat mesentery. An individual post-capillary venule in the mesentery was injected via a glass micropipette with cancer cells either in a perfusate of 1% BSA mammalian Ringer for control, or 1nM VEGF for test measurements. Cell adhesion was measured as either the number of adherent cells or the fluorescence intensity of adherent cells in a vessel segment for ~60 min. Our results showed that during both control and VEGF treatments, the number of adherent cells increased almost linearly with time over 60 min. VEGF treatment increased the adhesion rates of human tumor cells and mouse carcinomas 1.9-fold and 1.8-fold over those of controls, respectively. We also measured cancer cell adhesion after pretreatment of cells with the antibody blocking VEGF or that blocking alpha6 integrin, and pretreatment of the microvessel with VEGF receptor (KDR/Flk-1) inhibitor, SU1498, or anti-integrin ECM ligand antibody, anti-laminin-5. All antibodies and inhibitor significantly reduced adhesion, with anti-VEGF and SU1498 reducing it the most. Our results indicate that VEGF enhances cancer cell adhesion to the normal microvessel wall, and further suggest that VEGF and its receptor KDR/Flk-1, as well as integrins of tumor cells and their ligands at the endothelium, contribute to mammary cancer cell adhesion to vascular endothelium in vivo.</docText>

        <docText>D-dimer as a possible prognostic marker of operable hormone receptor-negative breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women by neoplasia. The mechanisms related to recurrence are unclear, specially the hemostatic alterations that occur during the development of the disease. Plasma D-dimer is a hypercoagulability and fibrinolytic system marker and is increased in patients with various solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemostatic status assessed by plasma D-dimer in operable breast cancer patients and to investigate its value as a prognostic marker. Materials and methods: The study comprised 32 patients with operable hormone receptor-negative breast cancer and a control group with 43 healthy women. Variables included presence and absence of breast cancer, clinical and histopathology findings, and overall survival. RESULTS: Plasma D-dimer level was normal in the control group and significantly higher in breast cancer patients (P = 0.001), as well as in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (P = 0.025). The results showed that plasma D-dimer levels were not correlated with clinical and histopathology findings (P &gt; 0.213). CONCLUSIONS: The results taken together indicate the presence of a hypercoagulability state in women with operable hormone receptor-negative breast cancer given the increased levels of D-dimer in this group. Therefore, considering higher levels of D-dimer in patients with a poor outcome, its evaluation may be a promising tool for prognosis in women with operable hormone receptor-negative breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Strategies to recruit immigrant women to participate in qualitative research.

OBJECTIVE: The present article aims to describe the process of selecting and recruiting women from distinct sociocultural backgrounds who participated in a qualitative research project and to outline the difficulties encountered according to the women's origin. METHODS: Research was carried out in Barcelona from 2007 to 2008 to identify how culture influences participation in a breast cancer early detection program. RESULTS: The study population consisted of native women and immigrant women from developing countries aged 40 to 69 years old resident in Barcelona. Participants were recruited through multiple strategies: key informants, cultural mediators, healthcare professionals, associations, religious institutions, the media, posters, adult education and language schools, and the population census. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment process cannot be confined to a single source and associations, religion institutions and cultural mediators are the most effective resources.</docText>

        <docText>Twins born after transplantation of ovarian cortical tissue and oocyte vitrification.

OBJECTIVE: To present a combination of ovarian tissue and oocyte cryopreservation as an effective strategy for achieving pregnancy in a breast cancer patient. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Tertiary care university-affiliated hospital, tissue bank, and infertility clinic. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old patient diagnosed with atypical medullar breast cancer and negative for estrogen, P, and HER2 receptors underwent ovarian tissue cryopreservation before receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. INTERVENTION(S): Laparoscopic ovarian cortex extraction, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, ovarian tissue thawing and transplantation, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), oocyte retrieval, vitrification and IVF, and embryo culture and replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Resumption of spontaneous ovarian function after transplantation, response to COS, oocyte vitrification, IVF, pregnancy, and delivery. RESULT(S): Menses occurred 63 days after transplantation. Sixteen mature oocytes were obtained in four COS procedures. All vitrified oocytes survived warming, and 77.7% were fertilized. Two day 3 embryos were replaced, and two healthy boys were born at 34 weeks. CONCLUSION(S): Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and grafting preserves fertility. Simultaneous oocyte vitrification increases the success of assisted reproductive technology in poor-prognosis patients and avoids the consequences of the short lifespan of the transplanted tissue.</docText>

        <docText>Management of endometrial cancer in Asia: consensus statement from the Asian Oncology Summit 2009.

Endometrial cancer is one of the gynaecological cancers that carries good overall prognosis because it is often detected at early stages of disease. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics replaced clinical staging with surgical staging in 1988 and updated the system in 2009. Controversies remain regarding the recommended screening protocol for women with a high risk of endometrial cancer, the role and benefit of retroperitoneal lymph-node dissection, the necessity of ovarian resection, the benefit and type of adjuvant radiation therapy, and the safety of hormone-replacement therapy after treatment. This article reviews the available evidence for optimum management of endometrial cancer and how management strategies can be applied in Asian countries with different levels of health-care resource availability and economic development. An overview of the literature for endometrial-cancer screening, diagnosis, and management is discussed. Consensus statements are formulated on the basis of basic, limited, enhanced, and maximum health-care resource availability, using the framework provided by the Breast Health Global Initiative.</docText>

        <docText>Management of HER2-positive breast cancer in Asia: consensus statement from the Asian Oncology Summit 2009.

Patients with breast cancer positive for human epidermal growth-factor receptor type 2 (HER2) are an important subgroup for consideration in the Asian context. Rationally designed, anti-HER2 targeted agents that can substantially improve treatment outcomes have become commercially available, but are still too costly for some groups in developed countries and for underdeveloped and developing nations. This review discusses the available evidence for optimum management of HER2-positive early and advanced breast cancer, and how this evidence can be applied to Asian countries with different levels of health-care resources and economic development--using framework provided by the Breast Health Global Initiative. We provide a brief overview of HER2 testing and discuss management of early and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, and formulate a consensus statement for the management of breast cancer in the context of basic, limited, enhanced, and maximum health-care resource availability.</docText>

        <docText>Hexachlorobenzene induces cell proliferation and IGF-I signaling pathway in an estrogen receptor alpha-dependent manner in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is an organochlorine pesticide widely distributed in the biosphere. ERalpha regulates the expression of genes involved in growth and development, and plays an important role in breast cancer. The present study focuses attention on the effect of HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5muM) on cell proliferation in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)(+) MCF-7, and ERalpha(-) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. We also studied the insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells. HCB (0.005 and 0.05muM) stimulated cell proliferation in MCF-7, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. The pesticide increased apoptosis in MCF-7, at HCB (0.5 and 5muM). At these doses, HCB induced the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated gene cytochrome P4501A1. MCF-7 cells exposed to HCB (0.005 and 0.05muM) overexpressed IGF-IR and insulin receptor (IR). IRS-1-phosphotyrosine content was increased in a dose dependent manner. ICI 182,780 prevented HCB-induced cell proliferation and IGF-I signaling in MCF-7 cells incubated in phenol-red free media. In addition, HCB (0.005muM) increased c-Src activation, Tyr537-ERalpha phosphorylation and ERalpha down-regulation. Taken together, our data indicate that HCB stimulation of cell proliferation and IGF-I signaling is ERalpha dependent in MCF-7 cells.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cell proliferation regulated by estradiol receptor: Therapeutic implications.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cell proliferation regulated by estradiol receptor: Therapeutic implications.

Estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-regulated transcription factor that controls human breast cancer cell proliferation. About 60-70% of human breast cancers express ER. In spite of major progress in the therapy of human breast cancer, many patients become resistant to pharmacologic treatments and develop metastatic breast tumors. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain tumor progression and resistance to the therapies. However, the causes of hormone-dependent breast tumor progression as well as therapy resistance are still debated. An increasing body of evidence from our and other laboratories shows that in breast cancer cells, in addition to its classical transcriptional action, ER stimulates proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in response to either ligand binding or growth factors. This discovery has led to the synthesis of new compounds specifically interfering in the rapid responses mediated by ER. It also suggests that the modalities currently in use for breast cancer treatment need to be reconsidered.</docText>

        <docText>Values of biologically equivalent doses in healthy tissues: Comparison of PDR and HDR brachytherapy techniques.

PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to compare the values of doses measured in healthy tissues in chosen pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy (PDRBT) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (HDRBT) fractionation schemas. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-one patients treated with PDRBT were qualified for calculations. This group included patients with head and neck cancer, brain tumor, breast cancer, sarcoma, penile cancer, and rectal cancer. The doses were calculated in chosen points in surrounded organs at risk (OaR). The biologically equivalent dose (BED) formula was used to compare doses in PDRBT and HDRBT. RESULTS: One ascertained that in biologically equivalent (to PDR) HDRBT, the increase of fractional dose from 4 to 10Gy caused the necessity to decrease the total dose in treatment target (p&lt;0.001). The use of HDR instead of PDR essentially caused lower physical and biologic doses in examined OaR. In many examined critical points in OaR where BED in the treatment area was the same, one ascertained the decrease of total physical HDR dose according to the growth of the fractional dose. Similar dependences were observed for BED. CONCLUSIONS: The use of biologically equivalent HDRBT instead of PDRBT caused the decrease of physical doses in the treatment target and the decrease of physical doses and BEDs in OaR. Prolongation of intervals between pulses in PDRBT was connected with lower values of BED doses in healthy tissues.</docText>

        <docText>Association between mode of breast cancer detection and diagnosis delay.

We investigated the association between mode of breast cancer (Bca) detection and diagnosis delay in a case-series of primary, histologically confirmed Bca patients from Southern Italy. Nine hundred and fifty nine women diagnosed with incident, primary Bca were recruited in two southern Italian regions. We grouped the mode of detection into two categories: Self-Detection (S-D) and Mammography (MG). Diagnosis delay was defined as the time between detection and a histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive Bca. 20.9% detected Bca with MG while 79.1% had S-D Bca. Women who detected Bca themselves (S-D) were more likely to delay breast cancer diagnosis than women who were diagnosed by a mammography (MG) (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.39-2.87); when considering the model adjusted for health system-related characteristics, the risk increased (OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.47-3.09). Our study indicates a disadvantage in terms of diagnostic delay for women who were admitted and treated in community hospitals compared to women admitted and treated in breast health services.</docText>

        <docText>Dose-intensified epirubicin versus standard-dose epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by CMF in breast cancer patients with 10 or more positive lymph nodes: Results of a randomised trial (GABG-IV E-93) - The German Adjuvant Breast Cancer Group.

To compare dose-intensified epirubicin monotherapy with a standard sequential regimen, patients with primary breast cancer and 10 involved axillary nodes were randomised to either four 21-day cycles of epirubicin 120mg/m(2) (E120; n=202) or four 21-day cycles of epirubicin 90mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600mg/m(2) (EC) followed by three 28-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF; n=209). Simultaneous hormonal treatment was applied in both arms. At 5years' median follow-up, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 47.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.2-55.2%) for E120 and 45.9% (38.5-53.3%) for EC-CMF. E120 was as effective as EC-CMF with regard to EFS (hazard ratio [HR] for E120 versus EC-CMF 1.04; 95% CI, 0.79-1.36; p=0.79) and overall survival (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.77-1.46; p=0.72). The data demonstrate that 4 cycles of dose-intensified epirubicin monotherapy can be as effective as 7 cycles of standard sequential polychemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients with 10 positive lymph nodes, despite treatment with a single agent and a shorter treatment duration.</docText>

        <docText>Feasibility of Postmastectomy Treatment With Helical TomoTherapy.

PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of helical tomotherapy for postmastectomy radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: By use of the TomoTherapy Hi-Art II treatment-planning system (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison, WI), helical tomotherapy dose plans were developed for 5 patients and compared with the mixed-beam (electron-photon) plans with which they had been treated. The TomoTherapy plans were evaluated by use of dose-volume quantities, tumor control probability, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and secondary cancer complication probability (SCCP). RESULTS: The TomoTherapy plans showed better dose homogeneity in the planning treatment volume containing the chest wall and internal mammary nodes (p = 0.001) and eliminated the need for abutting fields. For the normal tissues, the TomoTherapy plans showed a smaller fractional volume receiving 20Gy or greater for the ipsilateral lung (p = 0.05), no change in NTCP for postradiation pneumonitis, increased SCCP for each lung and both lungs together (p &lt; 0.02), no change in the volume of the heart receiving more than 15Gy, no change in NTCP for excess cardiac mortality, and a larger mean dose and SCCP in the contralateral breast (p &lt; 0.001). For nonspecific tissues, the volume receiving between 5Gy and 25Gy and SCCP were both larger for the TomoTherapy plans (p &lt; 0.01). Total SCCP was larger for the TomoTherapy plans (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the TomoTherapy plans had comparable tumor control probability and NTCP to the mixed-beam plans and increased SCCP. The TomoTherapy plans showed significantly greater dose homogeneity in the chest wall, which offers the potential for improved cosmesis after treatment. These factors have resulted in TomoTherapy often being the treatment of choice for postmastectomy radiation therapy in our clinic.</docText>

        <docText>Screening mammography: a cross-sectional study to compare characteristics of women aged 40 and older from the deep South who are current, overdue, and never screeners.

PURPOSE: We sought to identify unique barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening participation among women aged 40 and older from Mississippi who were categorized as current, overdue, and never screeners. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from a 2003 population-based survey with 987 women aged 40 and older were analyzed. Chi-square analysis and multinomial logistic regression examined how factors organized under the guidance of the Model of Health Services Utilization were associated with mammography screening status. RESULTS: Nearly one in four women was overdue or had never had a mammogram. Enabling factors, including poor access to care (no annual checkups, no health insurance) and to health information, lack of social support for screening, and competing needs, were significantly associated with being both overdue and never screeners. Pertaining to factors unique to each screening group, women were more likely to be overdue when they had no usual source of health care and believed that treatment was worse than the disease. In turn, women were more likely to be never screeners when they were African American, lacked a provider recommendation for screening, and held the fatalistic view that not much could be done to prevent breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Similar and unique factors impact utilization of mammography screening services among women. Those factors could inform efforts to increase screening rates.</docText>

        <docText>State-level differences in breast and cervical cancer screening by disability status: United States, 2008.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Despite reported disparities in the use of preventive services by disability status, there has been no national surveillance of breast and cervical cancer screening among women with disabilities in the United States. To address this, we used state-level surveillance data to identify disparities in breast and cervical cancer screening among women by disability status. METHODS: Data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to estimate disability prevalence and state-level differences in breast and cervical cancer screening among women by disability status. RESULTS: Overall, modest differences in breast cancer screening were found; women with a disability were less likely than those without to report receiving a mammogram during the past 2 years (72.2% vs. 77.8%; p &lt; .001). However, disparities in breast cancer screening were more pronounced at the state level. Furthermore, women with a disability were less likely than those without a disability to report receiving a Pap test during the past 3 years (78.9% vs. 83.4%; p &lt; .001). DISCUSSION: This epidemiologic evidence identifies an opportunity for federal and state programs, as well as other stakeholders, to form partnerships to align disability and women's health policies. Furthermore, it identifies the need for increased public awareness and resource allocation to reduce barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening experienced by women with disabilities.</docText>

OBJECTIVES: To review religious and ethical considerations for health care professionals when discussing fertility preservation with young survivors. DATA SOURCES: Published research reports and articles, published guidelines, and web sites. CONCLUSION: Although advances in assisted reproductive technology have increased fertility preservation options, not all treatments are acceptable or available for all young survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The ongoing provision of information from health care professionals allows young survivors to make high-quality decisions about fertility across the survivorship continuum. Knowledge of the influence that religious beliefs and economics have on decisions help nurses to better understand and support patients during this difficult time.</docText>

        <docTitle>Clusterin and chemoresistance.</docTitle>
        <docText>Clusterin and chemoresistance.

Resistance to anticancer agents is one of the primary impediments to effective cancer therapy. Chemoresistance occurs not only to clinically established therapeutic agents but also to novel targeted therapeutics. Both intrinsic and acquired mechanisms have been implicated in drug resistance but it remains controversial which mechanisms are responsible that lead to failure of therapy in cancer patients. Recent focus has turned to clusterin (CLU) as a key contributor to chemoresistance to anticancer agents. Its role has been documented in prostate cancer for paclitaxel/docetaxel resistance as well as in renal, breast, and lung tumor cells. Moreover, it is abnormally upregulated in numerous advanced stage and metastatic cancers spanning prostate, renal, bladder, breast, head and neck, colon, cervical, pancreatic, lung carcinomas, melanoma, and lymphoma. It is noteworthy that only the cytoplasmic/secretory clusterin form (sCLU), and not the nuclear form, is expressed in aggressive late stage tumors, which is in line with its antiapoptotic function. Most significantly, sCLU expression is documented to lead to broad-based resistance to other unrelated chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide, and camphothecin. Resistance to targeted death-inducing molecules, tumor necrosis factor, Fas and TRAIL, or histone deacetylase inhibitors can also be mediated by sCLU. Expression of sCLU may be an adaptive response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses but this adaptive response could pose a threat in malignant cells being treated with cytotoxic agents by enhancing their survival potential. The actual mechanisms for sCLU induction are unclear but STAT1 is required for its constitutive upregulation in docetaxel-resistant tumor cells. Known as a protein chaperone, sCLU appears to stabilize Ku70/Bax complexes, sequestering Bax from its ability to induce mitochondrial release of cytochrome c that triggers cell apoptosis. Thus, sCLU has a key role in preventing apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents and has the potential to be targeted for cancer therapy.</docText>

        <docText>The role of clusterin (CLU) in malignant transformation and drug resistance in breast carcinomas.

Breast cancer is the main cause of cancer-related death among women in Western countries. Current research is focused on identifying antiapoptotic proteins which could be a possible target for novel chemotherapeutic drugs. Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is an extracellular chaperone that has been functionally implicated in DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, apoptotic cell death and tumorigenesis. The implication of sCLU in carcinogenesis and the progression of breast carcinomas make it an interesting gene, worthy of investigation. It has been reported to present powerful antiapoptotic activity and to perform a prosurvival function with most therapeutic treatments for breast cancer. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of CLU in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to treatment in breast carcinomas.</docText>

        <docText>In vitro cytotoxicity and drug release properties of pH- and temperature-sensitive core-shell hydrogel microspheres.

A simple method has been developed to prepare smart P(N,N-diethylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (P(DEA-co-MAA)) microspheres that consist of well-defined temperature-sensitive cores and pH sensitive shells. The microgels have been prepared by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization using water as the solvent. The core-shell hydrogel microspheres have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV spectrometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron micrograph (TEM). Preliminary characterization of the biocompatibility of hydrogel microspheres has been done by the cytotoxicity assays using the HeLa human breast cancer cell line as probes. The in vitro drug release indicates that drug release rate, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and release kinetics depend upon the pH value and copolymer composition. According to this study, the hydrogel microspheres based on P(DEA-co-MAA) could serve as suitable candidate for drug site-specific carrier in intestine.</docText>

        <docText>CpG hypomethylation of MDR1 gene in tumor and serum of invasive ductal breast carcinoma patients.

OBJECTIVES:: Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene encodes P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transmembrane calcium-dependent efflux pump, implicated in drug resistance. In this prospective study, methylation status of MDR1 promoter and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated in tumor and serum of breast cancer patients. DESIGN AND METHODS:: Methylation-specific PCR was carried out to investigate the promoter methylation status of MDR1 in tumor and serum of 100 patients with invasive ductal carcinomas of breast (IDCs). The effect of promoter methylation on protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:: MDR1 was hypomethylated in 47% tumors and 44% paired sera of IDC patients and correlated significantly with increased tumor size and advanced tumor stage. Promoter hypomethylation of MDR1 in serum DNA showed 98% specificity and 50% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS:: Hypomethylation of MDR1 promoter in IDCs accounted for P-gp overexpression and aggressive biologic behavior in a subset of patients. Detection of these epigenetic changes in circulating DNA may not only enhance insight into the biological behavior of the primary tumor of an individual but may also provide valuable information regarding prognosis that can be readily monitored throughout the disease course.</docText>

        <docTitle>Female breast cancer mortality clusters within racial groups in the United States.</docTitle>
        <docText>Female breast cancer mortality clusters within racial groups in the United States.

Although breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the Unites States, to date there have been no nationwide studies systematically analyzing geographic variation and clustering. An assessment of spatial-temporal clusters of cancer mortality by age and race at the county level in the lower 48 United States indicated a primary cluster in the Northeast US for both younger (RR=1.349; all RR are p&lt;/=0.001) and older (RR=1.283) women in the all-race category. Similar cluster patterns in the North were detected for younger (RR=1.390) and older (RR=1.292) white women. The cluster for both younger (RR=1.337) and older (RR=1.251) black women was found in the Midwest. The clusters for all other racial groups combined were in the West for both younger (RR=1.682) and older (RR=1.542) groups. Regression model results suggest that lower socioeconomic status (SES) was more protective than higher status at every quartile step (Medium-high SES, OR=0.374; Medium-low, OR=0.137; Low, OR=0.061). This study may provide insight to aid in identifying geographic areas and subpopulations at increased risk for breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Imidazo1,2-apyrazine diaryl ureas: inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4.

Inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) has been validated by recently launched small molecules Sutent and Nexavar, both of which display activities against several angiogenesis-related RTKs. EphB4, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in the processes of embryogenesis and angiogenesis, has been shown to be aberrantly up regulated in many cancer types such as breast, lung, bladder and prostate. We propose that inhibition of EphB4 in addition to other validated RTKs would enhance the anti-angiogenic effect and ultimately result in more pronounced anti-cancer efficacy. Herein we report the discovery and SAR of a novel series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine diarylureas that show nanomolar potency for the EphB4 receptor, in addition to potent activity against several other RTKs.</docText>

        <docText>Radiation therapy and tamoxifen after breast-conserving surgery: Updated results of a 2x2 randomised clinical trial in patients with low risk of recurrence.

To study the role of radiotherapy and tamoxifen after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with a favourable prognosis, a clinical trial was initiated by the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG-V). Between 1991 and 1998, 361 patients (pT 1pN0M0, aged 45-75years, receptor positive, grades I and II) were randomised to radiotherapy (yes/no) and tamoxifen for 2years (yes/no) in a 2x2-factorial design; the exclusion of seven centres (14 patients) left 347 patients for the analysis. First results after a median follow-up of 5.9years were published. Herein we present updated results after a median follow-up of about 10years. Hundred and eleven events concerning event-free survival (EFS) have been observed. Since a strong interactive effect between radiotherapy and tamoxifen has been established, the results are presented in terms of the treatment effects for all four treatment groups separately. Mainly due to the presence of local recurrences, the event rate was much higher in the group with BCS only than in the other three groups. No significant difference could be established between the four treatment groups for distant disease-free survival rates (DDFS). Updated results give further evidence that even in patients with a favourable prognosis, the avoidance of radiotherapy and tamoxifen after BCS increases the rate of local recurrences substantially. Rates are about three times higher in the BCS only group. For the two outcomes EFS and DDFS, no important difference could be seen between the three groups with an additional treatment. However, because of the limited sample size with corresponding low power the strength of evidence for such a comparison is weak.</docText>

        <docText>An estimate of overdiagnosis 15 years after the start of mammographic screening in Florence.

AIM: Several studies have tried to quantify overdiagnosis of breast cancer with mammography screening, but estimates vary widely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of overdiagnosis of breast cancer 15 years after the introduction of service screening in Florence (Italy). METHODS: We selected 61,568 women aged 50-69 years at the beginning of service screening (1990) and we used the cancer registry data to follow up them for breast cancer incidence. The measure of overdiagnosis is the ratio of cumulative incidence of breast cancer in the invited group (observed) at least 5 years after the last screening to that expected in the absence of screening. RESULTS: Under the assumption of a 1.2% annual trend in pre-screening incidence in women aged 60-69 years at the start of service screening, the ratio of observed to expected cumulative cases was 1.01 (95%CI: 0.95-1.07), but assuming no incidence trend, an unlikely scenario, the estimate of overdiagnosis rose to 1.13 (95%CI: 1.07-1.19). CONCLUSION: Overdiagnosis of breast cancer in Florentine service screening can be estimated only for women aged 60-69 years at the start of service screening, for it is only for this group that a sufficient follow-up period is available after the last screening. Although the estimate of overdiagnosis is very sensitive to pre-screening trend estimates, our data show that 15 years after the introduction of mammographic service screening the degree of overdiagnosis was nearly zero and more than likely lower than 13% in this age group.</docText>

        <docText>Locoregional Outcomes of Inflammatory Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Standard Fractionation Radiation and Daily Skin Bolus in the Taxane Era.

PURPOSE: To assess locoregional outcomes of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) patients who received standard fractionation radiation with daily skin bolus and taxanes as part of combined-modality therapy (CMT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 107 patients diagnosed with IBC between January 1995 and March 2006 who presented to our department for adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). RESULTS: All patients received chemotherapy (95% anthracycline and 95% taxane), modified radical mastectomy, and RT to the chest wall and regional lymphatics using standard fractionation to 50 Gy and daily skin bolus. The RT to the chest wall was delivered via electrons (55%) or photons (45%) in daily fractions of 180 cGy (73%) or 200 cGy (27%). Scar boost was performed in 11%. A majority (84%) of patients completed the prescribed treatment. Median follow-up was 47 months (range, 10-134 months). Locoregional control (LRC) at 3 years and 5 years was 90% and 87%, respectively. Distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) at 3 years and 5 years was 61% and 47%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent locoregional control was observed in this population of IBC patients who received standard fractionation radiation with daily skin bolus and taxanes as part of combined-modality therapy. Distant metastases-free survival remains a significant therapeutic challenge.</docText>

        <docText>Contribution to the study of painful and functional sequellae after breast reconstruction using latissimus dorsi flap. Investigation into 149 patients.

Latissimus dorsi flap is the most commonly used among tissues transfers for breast reconstruction. If its qualities and performances are well known, few papers have studied sequellae of this flap, particularly painful. The purpose of this paper is to provide a contribution about this subject. Postulating the complexity of this step, we limited ourselves initially to an evaluation based on analysis of concise questionnaire mailed to two pools of patients with different delays since their reconstruction using latissimus flap. In the two groups of patients, announced principal embarrassment - logically associated with a gestural limitation - is the feeling of axillo-dorsal rigidity, more pregnant than the pain itself. This one is marked during the 2 to 4 first months in the majority of the patients (68 and 66 %), and can persist several years in some among them (14 %). These after-effects did not prevent almost all of the patients to take again their domestic and professional activities and to express a high level of satisfaction with respect to their reconstruction. The addition of a prospective series studying the postoperative pain after reconstruction with or without latissimus flap tends to confirm that any oncologic breast surgery, ablative or reconstructive, expose to painful sequellae more linked to individual factors than to the technique implemented.</docText>

        <docText>An epigenetic switch involving NF-kappaB, Lin28, Let-7 MicroRNA, and IL6 links inflammation to cell transformation.

Inflammation is linked clinically and epidemiologically to cancer, and NF-kappaB appears to play a causative role, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that transient activation of Src oncoprotein can mediate an epigenetic switch from immortalized breast cells to a stably transformed line that forms self-renewing mammospheres that contain cancer stem cells. Src activation triggers an inflammatory response mediated by NF-kappaB that directly activates Lin28 transcription and rapidly reduces let-7 microRNA levels. Let-7 directly inhibits IL6 expression, resulting in higher levels of IL6 than achieved by NF-kappaB activation. IL6-mediated activation of the STAT3 transcription factor is necessary for transformation, and IL6 activates NF-kappaB, thereby completing a positive feedback loop. This regulatory circuit operates in other cancer cells lines, and its transcriptional signature is found in human cancer tissues. Thus, inflammation activates a positive feedback loop that maintains the epigenetic transformed state for many generations in the absence of the inducing signal.</docText>

        <docText>Control of cyclin D1 and breast tumorigenesis by the EglN2 prolyl hydroxylase.

2-Oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including the EglN prolyl hydroxylases that regulate HIF, can be inhibited with drug-like molecules. EglN2 is estrogen inducible in breast carcinoma cells and the lone Drosophila EglN interacts genetically with Cyclin D1. Although EglN2 is a nonessential gene, we found that EglN2 inactivation decreases Cyclin D1 levels and suppresses mammary gland proliferation in vivo. Regulation of Cyclin D1 is a specific attribute of EglN2 among the EglN proteins and is HIF independent. Loss of EglN2 catalytic activity inhibits estrogen-dependent breast cancer tumorigenesis and can be rescued by exogenous Cyclin D1. EglN2 depletion also impairs the fitness of lung, brain, and hematopoietic cancer lines. These findings support the exploration of EglN2 inhibitors as therapeutics for estrogen-dependent breast cancer and other malignancies.</docText>

        <docText>A Rapid-Response Economic Evaluation of the UK NHS Cancer Reform Strategy Breast Cancer Screening Program Extension via a Plausible Bounds Approach.

ABSTRACT Objectives: The 2007 National Health Service Cancer Reform Strategy includes a proposed extension of the UK breast screening program to women aged 47 to 49 years. The aim of this study is to undertake a preliminary assessment of this proposal to identify the key factors determining its cost-effectiveness and to determine whether there is sufficient uncertainty that requires more thorough analyses. Methods: An economic model was constructed. For simplicity, the health impact of screening was estimated by calculating the lives saved through shifts in prognostic group. A "plausible bounds" approach was used to derive distributions for model parameters for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. UK data were used to populate the model. Results: The cost-effectiveness of the extension is estimated to be pound27,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with a 29% probability of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. The deterministic estimate of benefit becomes negative if the anxiety due to a false-positive result is set at 0.028 QALYs. Including a small positive benefit from a negative screen has a dramatic impact on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The impact of other factors appears less marked. Conclusions: Because the vast majority of women aged 47 to 49 years will test negative when screened for breast cancer and most of those who test positive will actually be free of the disease, the psychological impacts of screening are likely to drive cost-effectiveness for this age group. Therefore, a research priority should be to better understand and quantify these effects.</docText>

        <docText>Use of Interpreters by Physicians Treating Limited English Proficient Women with Breast Cancer: Results from the Provider Survey of the Los Angeles Women's Health Study.

Objective. Little is known about how cancer physicians communicate with limited English proficient (LEP) patients. We studied physician-reported use and availability of interpreters. Data Sources. A 2004 survey was fielded among physicians identified by a population-based sample of breast cancer patients. Three hundred and forty-eight physicians completed mailed surveys (response rate: 77 percent) regarding the structure and organization of care. Study Design and Settings. We used logistic regression to analyze use and availability of interpreters. Principal Findings. Most physicians reported treating LEP patients. Among physicians using interpreters within the last 12 months, 42 percent reported using trained medical interpreters, 21 percent telephone interpreter services, and 75 percent reported using untrained interpreters to communicate with LEP patients. Only one-third of physicians reported good availability of trained medical interpreters or telephone interpreter services when needed. Compared with HMO physicians, physicians in solo practice and single-specialty medical groups were less likely to report using trained medical interpreters or telephone interpreter services, and they were less likely to report good availability of these services. Conclusions. There were important practice setting differences predicting use and availability of trained medical interpreters and telephone interpretation services. These findings may have troubling implications for effective physician-patient communication critically needed during cancer treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Is sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy feasible in Chinese patients with invasive breast cancers?

BACKGROUND: A wide variation in the accuracy of performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer has been reported despite its increased use. This study aimed to be the first to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Chinese patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A review of prospectively collected data from breast cancer patients who had SLNB after prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. A combination of radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-albumin colloid (Pharmalucence, MA, USA) and Patent Blue V dye (Guerbet, France) was used to identify the SLN. SLNB was followed by standard axillary dissection in all patients. RESULTS: A total of 365 patients received SLNB from May 1999 to April 2006. A total of 78 patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by SLNB were recruited. The SLN identification rate, false-negative rate and accuracy rate were 83.3, 10.3 and 73.1%, respectively. Analysis was stratified into clinical and pathological response group. Location of the tumour was also found to be an important factor in affecting the false-negative rate (P= 0.019). For upper, outer quadrant tumour, five (32.3%, out of 16) patients presented with false-negative. Patients with more sentinel lymph node harvest had higher accuracy. A total of 22 patients had three or more lymph nodes harvested, and the false-negative rate was 21.7% (5 out of 23 patients) (P= 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that SLNB is feasible and applicable in Chinese patients with breast cancer with operable disease who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</docText>

        <docText>Managing postmastectomy lymphedema with low-level laser therapy.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in managing postmastectomy lymphedema. BACKGROUND DATA: Postmastectomy lymphedema (PML) is a common complication of breast cancer treatment that causes various symptoms, functional impairment, or even psychosocial morbidity. A prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial was conducted to examine the effectiveness of LLLT on managing PML. METHODS: Twenty-one women suffering from unilateral PML were randomly allocated to receive either 12 sessions of LLLT in 4 wk (the laser group) or no laser irradiation (the control group). Volumetry and tonometry were used to monitor arm volume and tissue resistance; the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was used for measuring subjective symptoms. Outcome measures were assessed before and after the treatment period and at the 4 wk follow-up. RESULTS: Reduction in arm volume and increase in tissue softening was found in the laser group only. At the follow-up session, significant between-group differences (all p &lt; 0.05) were found in arm volume and tissue resistance at the anterior torso and forearm region. The laser group had a 16% reduction in the arm volume at the end of the treatment period, that dropped to 28% in the follow-up. Moreover, the laser group demonstrated a cumulative increase from 15% to 33% in the tonometry readings over the forearm and anterior torso. The DASH score of the laser group showed progressive improvement over time. CONCLUSION: LLLT was effective in the management of PML, and the effects were maintained to the 4 wk follow-up.</docText>

        <docText>A novel Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-based breast cancer vaccine that coexpresses multiple tandem repeats of MUC1 and CD80 breaks the immune tolerance and inhibits MUC1-positive breast cancer growth.

Many approaches targeting MUC1 for breast tumor immunotherapy have been attempted. However, preclinical trials with MUC1 showed that MUC1 is a relatively poor immunogen in human. B7 molecules that bind CD28 provide an antigen-nonspecific signal, which, along with an antigen-specific signal, is crucial for T-cell activation. In the present study, we constructed a novel Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-based breast cancer vaccine that coexpressed four VNTRs (variable-number tandem repeats) of MUC1 and CD80 (rBCG-MVNTR4-CD80). The aim of our study was to enhance anti-MUC1 tumor immunity by vaccination of hu-PBL-SCID mice with the recombinant BCG vaccine. The inhibition effect on tumors from the mice immunized with rBCG-MVNTR4-CD80 significantly increased, compared with rBCG-MVNTR4, BCG-pDE22, and phosphate-buffered saline immunized mice (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05). ELISpot assays showed that there was a significant increase in interferon-gamma production in the splenocytes from the mice immunized with rBCG-MVNTR4-CD80. In addition, CD4 and CD8-positive lymphocytes in tumors from rBCG-MVNTR4-CD80-immunized animals were detected. These data showed that rBCG-MVNTR4-CD80 immunization elicited tumor-specific immune response, which closely related with the B7 molecule (CD80), indicating that the vaccine may be a good candidate for MUC1-positive breast cancer immunotherapy.</docText>

        <docText>Management of metastatic bone pain with repeated doses of rhenium 186-HEDP in patients under therapy with zoledronic acid: a safe and additively effective practice.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare pain response and hematologic toxicity between single and multiple therapies with (186)Re-HEDP under zoledronic acid in patients suffering from painful osseous metastases from prostate or breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five (45) patients received multiple therapies of (186)Re-HEDP (n = 77), under a stable regimen of analgesics and zoledronic acid, far off other therapeutic manipulations, and with no extraosseous disease progression. Hematologic status and pain indices were followed up regularly. RESULTS: Evaluable patients (n = 12), received 31 (186)Re-HEDP therapies. After the first treatment with (186)Re-HEDP, the mean percentile decrease for hemoglobin was 4.7%, for white blood cells was 21.4%, and for platelets was 12%. After multiple therapies, the respective declines were 7.0%, 16.0%, and 23.4%. With respect to baseline blood counts, only thrombocytes showed a tendency for greater decrease after repeated treatments, yet not of clinical significance. Favorable clinical response occurred after the first therapy in 10 of 12 patients (83.3%), after multiple doses in 15 of 19 (78.9%), and overall in 25 of 31 (80.6%) of (186)Re-HEDP therapies. Significant post-therapy improvement in pain indices was observed in all cases, regardless of the number of therapeutic doses. CONCLUSIONS: Retreatments with (186)Re-HEDP under zoledronic acid provide continuing effectiveness in metastatic bone pain and are safe enough, if an acceptable baseline hematologic status exists.</docText>

        <docText>Analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in southern Iranian Breast cancer patients.

The germline mutations of breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 (BRCA2) have been associated with a significant increase in breast cancer risk and certain other cancers. Among the most known mutations in these tumor suppressor genes are 5382insC and 185delAG in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2. The aim of the current study was to investigate the frequency of these BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in southern Iranian familial and sporadic cases with breast cancer.Two hundred fifty women with sporadic breast cancer, 55 women with a familial history of breast cancer in their first degree-relatives and 200 healthy women formed the studied groups. DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was extracted and analyzed by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. The data of this investigation indicated that the aforementioned founder mutations were not detected in the groups studied. Our results indicate that 5382insC and 185delAG mutations in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2 have much less frequency in Iranian breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docTitle>Breast cancer immunohistochemical features in young women with BRCA 1/2 mutations.</docTitle>
        <docText>Breast cancer immunohistochemical features in young women with BRCA 1/2 mutations.

Breast cancer among young women is a rare pathology. In most studies published so far, this patients group is not being analyzed separately. Particularities of this pathology require an additional examination of the immunohistochemical and molecular-genetic markers of the disease for development of the effective treatment protocols. The mutations of BRCA1/2 are the important factor impacting to the disease prognosis along the age of the patient. AIM: To compare the expression of prognostically meaningful immunohistochemical markers such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2, p53, Ki-67, in tumor cells of the female patients with breast cancer aged less than 36 depending on the presence of absence of mutations in CRCA1/2 genes. METHODS: Two hundred forty-eight patients aged less than 36 at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer were examined clinically. Expression of ER, PR HER-2, p53, Ki-67 was determined by indirect immunohistochemical method. mutations of BRCA1 (185delAG, o5382insC) and BRCA2(6174delT) genes were screened using multiplex PCR in 99 patients. RESULTS: Mutations of BRCA1/2 genes were found in 9.1% of patients. More aggressive clinical course of the disease was seen in mutations carriers, who had 3-years survival of only 55.6%. They did not demonstrated of ER, PR, and HER-2 in 88.0% of the cases. Whereas, patients without BRCA1/2 mutations did no express ER, PR, and HER-2 in only 42.0% of cases. There were no differences between patients with and without mutations in terms of tumor size, presence of metastases in lymph nodes, p53 and Ki-67 expression. CONCLUSION: Presence of BRCA1/2 genes mutations in young women is associated with more aggressiveness of the breast cancer (their 3-years survival is 25,5% less) and absence of the ER, PR, HER-2 receptors, which is unfavorable prognostic factor in terms of hormone therapy. These data should be taken into account at chemotherapy planning, especially in patients with early stages of the disease. There were no differences between patients with and without BRCA1/2 mutations in terms of tumor size, lymph nodes involvement, tumor histology, and p53 and Ki-67 proteins expression.</docText>

        <docTitle>Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations of breast cancer treated with radiofrequency ablation.</docTitle>
        <docText>Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations of breast cancer treated with radiofrequency ablation.

BACKGROUND: Although RF ablation is a promising non-surgical ablation technique for the treatment of breast cancer, assessment of the efficacy requires not only imaging of tumor necrosis but also histological confirmation. METHODS: Two series of patients were treated with RF ablation. In the first series, 17 patients underwent surgical resection immediately and 17 underwent delayed mammotome excision in the second series. The ablated tumor tissue was examined histologically with H&amp;E staining and NADH-diaphorase staining. Furthermore, ssDNA was immunohistochemically stained in the specimen where tumor cells were histologically detected. RESULTS: In the first series, mild response was histologically seen in 14 of 17 patients (82%), whereas complete response was observed in 8 of 16 patients (50%) in the second series. However, NADH-diaphorase staining did not demonstrate any viable tumor tissues in any patient in either the first or the second series. ssDNA staining was positive (non-viable) in 13 of 16 cases in the first series, but it was positive in all 8 cases tested in the second series. CONCLUSION: Although NADH-diaphorase staining is essential to evaluate tumor cell viability immediately after RF ablation, ssDNA may be useful for the assessment of cell viability after some interval following RF ablation.

        <docText>The role of PET CT to evaluate the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer: Comparison with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging.

BACKGROUND: Recently PET is emerged as a method to estimate the response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in advanced breast cancer. This study is aimed to estimate the predictive role of PET CT and other imaging modalities (ultrasound, MRI) through NAC. METHODS: PET CT was acquired before and after NAC from 41 patients. Pathologic results were classified as pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pCR. The results of clinical responses were assessed with imaging indexes (postTx, postchemotherapy size or peak standardized uptake values (pSUV); delta, the size difference between treatment; RR, reduction rate of tumor size or pSUV), and they were compared with pathologic results. RESULTS: Seven patients (17.1%) showed pCR. As a result of comparison of the image index, all image indexes of MRI were predictive for pCR (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, only delta and RR of US, RR of PET CT were significant. The area under curve of delta and RR in MRI were higher (0.91, 0.90) than US (0.83, 0.80) and PET CT (0.62, 0.72). The MRI is superior to the US or PET CT. CONCLUSIONS: We have concluded that the MRI is better than PET CT for monitoring the effect of NAC in advanced breast cancer. J. Surg. Oncol.

        <docTitle>The molecular underpinning of lobular histological growth pattern: a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of invasive lobular carcinomas and grade- and molecular subtype-matched invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type.</docTitle>
        <docText>The molecular underpinning of lobular histological growth pattern: a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of invasive lobular carcinomas and grade- and molecular subtype-matched invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type.

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the most frequent special type of breast cancer. The majority of these tumours are of low histological grade, express hormone receptors, and lack HER2 expression. The pleomorphic variant of ILCs (PLCs) is characterized by atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and is reported to have an aggressive clinical behaviour. Expression profiling studies have demonstrated that classic ILCs preferentially display a luminal phenotype, whereas PLCs may be of luminal, HER2 or molecular apocrine subtypes. The aims of this study were two-fold: to determine the transcriptomic characteristics of lobular carcinomas and to define the genome-wide transcriptomic differences between classic ILCs and PLCs. To define the transcriptomic characteristics of ILCs, minimizing the impact of histological grade and molecular subtype on the analysis, we subjected a series of grade- and molecular subtype-matched ILCs and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) to genome-wide gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that ILCs formed a separate cluster and a supervised analysis revealed that 5.8% of the transcriptionally regulated genes were significantly differentially expressed in ILCs compared to grade- and molecular subtype-matched IDCs. ILCs displayed down-regulation of E-cadherin and of genes related to actin cytoskeleton remodelling, protein ubiquitin, DNA repair, cell adhesion, TGF-beta signalling; and up-regulation of transcription factors/immediate early genes, lipid/prostaglandin biosynthesis genes, and cell migration-associated genes. Supervised analysis of classic ILCs and PLCs demonstrated that less than 0.1% of genes were significantly differentially expressed between these tumour subtypes. Our results demonstrate that ILCs differ from grade- and molecular subtype-matched IDCs in the expression of genes related to cell adhesion, cell-to-cell signalling, and actin cytoskeleton signalling. However, classic ILCs and PLCs are remarkably similar at the molecular level and should be considered as part of a spectrum of lesions.

        <docText>Disparities in medical care among commercially insured patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer: opportunities for intervention.

BACKGROUND:: African-American women have increased breast cancer mortality compared with white women. Diagnostic and treatment gaps may contribute to this disparity. METHODS:: In this retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, Southern US health plan claims data and linked medical charts were used to identify racial disparities in the diagnoses, treatment, and mortality of commercially insured women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. White women (n = 476) and African-American women (n = 99) with newly diagnosed breast cancer were identified by breast cancer claims codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 174, 233.0, 238.3, and 239.3) between January 2000 and December 2004. Race, diagnoses (breast cancer stage, estrogen/progesterone receptor [ER/PR]-positive status), treatment (breast-conserving surgery, antiestrogen therapy, and chemotherapy interruption or reduction), and all-cause mortality were assessed from medical charts. Multivariate regression analyses were adjusted for age, geography, and socioeconomic status to test the association of race with diagnoses/treatment. RESULTS:: White women were older (P &lt; .001) and had higher rates of diagnosis at stage 0/I (55.2% vs 38.4%; P &lt; .05) than African-American women. More white women had positive ER/PR status (75% vs 56% African-American; P = .001) and received antiestrogen therapy if they were positive (37.2% vs 27.3% African-American; P &lt; .001). White women received slightly more breast-conserving surgery and chemotherapy dose modification than African-American women (P value nonsignificant). African-American women had a higher mortality rate (8.1%) than white women (3.6%; P = .06). In adjusted analyses, African-American women were diagnosed at later stages (odds ratio, 1.71; P = .02), and white women received more antiestrogen therapy (odds ratio, 2.1; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS:: Disparities in medical care among patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were evident between African-American women and white women despite health plan insurance coverage. Interventions that address the gaps identified are needed. Cancer 2009. (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.</docText>

        <docTitle>A phase 2 clinical trial of nab-paclitaxel in previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma.</docTitle>
        <docText>A phase 2 clinical trial of nab-paclitaxel in previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma.

BACKGROUND:: nab-Paclitaxel (ABI-007, Abraxane), a 130-nM, albumin-bound (nab) particle form of Cremophor-free paclitaxel, is approved for metastatic breast cancer. In the current study, the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel were evaluated in previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). METHODS:: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, measurable MM were enrolled. nab-Paclitaxel was administered intravenously weekly for 3 of 4 weeks at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) (in previously treated patients) or 150 mg/m(2) (in chemotherapy-naive patients). RESULTS:: Thirty-seven patients were treated in each cohort. The response rate was 2.7% in the previously treated cohort and 21.6% in the chemotherapy-naive cohort; the response plus stable disease rate was 37.8% and 48.6% in the previously treated and chemotherapy-naive cohorts, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months and 4.5 months, and the median survival was 12.1 months and 9.6 months, respectively. The probability of being alive and free of disease progression at 6 months was 27% for the previously treated cohort and 34% for the chemotherapy-naive cohort; the probability of surviving 1 year was 49% and 41%, respectively, for the previously treated and chemotherapy-naive cohorts. Approximately 78% of the previously treated patients and 49% of the chemotherapy-naive patients were treated without dose reduction. Eight (22%) chemotherapy-naive patients discontinued therapy because of toxicities. Drug-related toxicities included grade 3 to 4 (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]) neuropathy, alopecia, neutropenia, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS:: nab-Paclitaxel was found to be well tolerated and demonstrated activity in both previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with MM. The response rate, PFS, and survival compared favorably with current standard dacarbazine therapy and combination therapies for melanoma. nab-Paclitaxel therapy of MM should be investigated further in controlled clinical trials.

        <docTitle>Analyzing longitudinal data with patients in different disease states during follow-up and death as final state.</docTitle>
        <docText>Analyzing longitudinal data with patients in different disease states during follow-up and death as final state.

This paper considers the analysis of longitudinal data complicated by the fact that during follow-up patients can be in different disease states, such as remission, relapse or death. If both the response of interest (for example, quality of life (QOL)) and the amount of missing data depend on this disease state, ignoring the disease state will yield biased means. Death as the final state is an additional complication because no measurements after death are taken and often the outcome of interest is undefined after death.We discuss a new approach to model these types of data. In our approach the probability to be in each of the different disease states over time is estimated using multi-state models. In each different disease state, the conditional mean given the disease state is modeled directly. Generalized estimation equations are used to estimate the parameters of the conditional means, with inverse probability weights to account for unobserved responses.This approach shows the effect of the disease state on the longitudinal response. Furthermore, it yields estimates of the overall mean response over time, either conditionally on being alive or after imputing predefined values for the response after death. Graphical methods to visualize the joint distribution of disease state and response are discussed.As an example, the analysis of a Dutch randomized clinical trial for breast cancer is considered. In this study, the long-term impact on the QOL for two different chemotherapy schedules was studied with three disease states: alive without relapse, alive after relapse and death.

        <docText>Expression of estrogen receptor alpha increases leptin-induced STAT3 activity in breast cancer cells.

Adipositas correlates with an enhanced risk of developing malignant diseases such as breast cancer, endometrial tumor or prostate carcinoma, but the molecular basis for this is not well understood. Potential mechanisms include increased bioavailability of adipocytokines (e.g. leptin) and steroid hormones. Here, we investigated cross-talk between ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha) and leptin-induced activation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), a transactivator of important oncogenes. Upon leptin binding to its receptor Ob-RL (obesity receptor), STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and transactivation activity were enhanced by simultaneously expressing ERalpha. Down-regulation of ERalpha using siRNA abolished leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, leptin-mediated STAT3 activation was unaffected by co-stimulation with the ERalpha ligands estradiol (E2) or estrogen antagonists ICI182,780 and tamoxifen, implying that enhancement of leptin-mediated STAT3 activity is independent of ERalpha ligands. We also detected ERalpha binding to STAT3 and JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), resulting in enhanced JAK2 activity upstream of STAT3 in response to leptin that might lead to an increased ERalpha-dependent cell viability. Altogether, our results indicate that leptin-induced STAT3 activation acts as a key event in ERalpha-dependent development of malignant diseases. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docTitle>Beta-carotene supplementation and cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</docTitle>
        <docText>Beta-carotene supplementation and cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

The effect of beta-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence has been investigated in several randomized controlled trials. The objective was to review the effect of beta-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence in randomized trials by cancer site, beta-carotene supplementation characteristics and study population. Relevant trials were retrieved by searching PubMed (up to April 2009). Authors involved in selected studies were contacted for additional information. Thirteen publications reporting results from 9 randomized controlled trials were included. Overall, no effect of beta-carotene supplementation was observed on the incidence of all cancers combined (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98-1.04), pancreatic cancer (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73-1.36), colorectal cancer (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.09), prostate cancer (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91-1.07), breast cancer (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.10), melanoma (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65-1.46) and non melanoma skin cancer (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.05). The incidence of lung and stomach cancers were significantly increased in individuals supplemented with beta-carotene at 20-30 mg/day (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06-1.27 and RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.70), in smokers and asbestos workers (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.34 and RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.08-2.19) compared to the placebo group. Beta-carotene supplementation has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on cancer prevention. Conversely, it was associated with increased risk not only of lung cancer but also of gastric cancer at doses of 20-30 mg/day, in smokers and asbestos workers. This study adds to the evidence that nutritional prevention of cancer through beta-carotene supplementation should not be recommended. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docText>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2))-specific AKT1 is oncogenic.

The protein kinase AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1), also referred to as PKB (protein kinase B), is an essential mediator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. Elevated activity of AKT1 is common in human cancer. Localization at the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced phosphorylation and activation of AKT1, is an important factor determining the oncogenicity of this kinase. Although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway is frequently upregulated in cancer, cancer-specific mutations in AKT1 are not common. Recently, such a mutation has been identified in breast, colon and ovarian cancers. The mutation is located in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT1 and results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at residue 17. The resultant change in the conformation of the PH domain facilitates membrane binding of the mutant protein. Here we show that exchange of the PH domain leading to preferential binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) over phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) constitutively activates AKT1. AKT1 with this altered PIP affinity induces oncogenic transformation in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts and causes neoplastic growth and angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo. Gain-of-function mutants of AKT1 may not be affected by PI3K inhibitors that are currently in development. Therefore, AKT1 remains a distinct and important cancer target. (c) 2009 UICC.</docText>

        <docText>The Leu33Pro polymorphism in the ITGB3 gene does not modify BRCA1/2-associated breast or ovarian cancer risks: results from a multicenter study among 15,542 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.

Integrins containing the beta(3) subunit are key players in tumor growth and metastasis. A functional Leu33Pro polymorphism (rs5918) in the beta(3) subunit of the integrin gene (ITGB3) has previously been suggested to act as a modifier of ovarian cancer risk in Polish BRCA1 mutation carriers. To investigate the association further, we genotyped 9,998 BRCA1 and 5,544 BRCA2 mutation carriers from 34 studies from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 for the ITGB3 Leu33Pro polymorphism. Data were analysed within a Cox-proportional hazards framework using a retrospective likelihood approach. There was marginal evidence that the ITGB3 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers (per-allele Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.23, p-trend 0.05). However, when the original Polish study was excluded from the analysis, the polymorphism was no longer significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.19, p-trend 0.25). There was no evidence of an association with ovarian cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89-1.32). The polymorphism was not associated with breast cancer risk for either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The ITGB3 Leu33Pro polymorphism does not modify breast or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.</docText>

        <docText>Assessment of false-negative cases of breast MR imaging in women with a familial or genetic predisposition.

In order to assess the characteristics of malignant breast lesions those were not detected during screening by MR imaging. In the Dutch MRI screening study (MRISC), a non-randomized prospective multicenter study, women with high familial risk or a genetic predisposition for breast cancer were screened once a year by mammography and MRI and every 6 months with a clinical breast examination (CBE). The false-negative MR examinations were subject of this study and were retrospectively reviewed by two experienced radiologists. From November 1999 until March 2006, 2,157 women were eligible for study analyses. Ninety-seven malignant breast tumors were detected, including 19 DCIS (20%). In 22 patients with a malignant lesion, the MRI was assessed as BI-RADS 1 or 2. One patient was excluded because the examinations were not available for review. Forty-three percent (9/21) of the false-negative MR cases concerned pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or DCIS with invasive foci, in eight of them no enhancement was seen at the review. In six patients the features of malignancy were missed or misinterpreted. Small lesion size (n = 3), extensive diffuse contrast enhancement of the breast parenchyma (n = 2), and a technically inadequate examination (n = 1) were other causes of the missed diagnosis. A major part of the false-negative MR diagnoses concerned non-enhancing DCIS, underlining the necessity of screening not only with MRI but also with mammography. Improvement of MRI scanning protocols may increase the detection rate of DCIS. The missed and misinterpreted cases are reflecting the learning curve of a multicenter study.</docText>

        <docText>Loco-regional treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients: Is there a survival benefit?

A number of studies have recently demonstrated a survival benefit in stage IV breast cancer patients following surgical resection of the primary tumor. Here, we investigate the relationship between loco-regional treatment and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer and evaluate the impact of different loco-regional treatments. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed to analyze studies with the following criteria: Type of loco-regional treatment (surgery alone or combined with radiation, radiotherapy), overall survival, progression-free survival, selection factors for local treatment, and complication rates. Thirteen studies evaluated the effect of loco-regional treatment on overall survival with overall median survival increasing from a range of 12.6-28.3 months among patients without surgery to a range of 25-42 months among patients with surgery. In addition, six studies reported a 3-year survival benefit of 28-95% and 17-79% in women with and without loco-regional therapy respectively. Two studies did not find any improvement in overall survival. One study found an improvement in 5-year breast cancer-specific survival of 27% with negative surgical margins versus 12% with no surgery. Three studies reported an advantage in progression-free survival in the treatment group compared with the non-treatment group. Loco-regional treatment for breast cancer patients with distant metastases at diagnosis is an important issue because of possible improvement of survival or disease-free survival. The possibility of surgery and/or radiotherapy following induction chemotherapy should be weighed and left to individual practice. Participation in randomized controlled trials should be encouraged.</docText>

        <docText>The Use of Amino Acid Linkers in the Conjugation of Paclitaxel with Hyaluronic Acid as Drug Delivery System: Synthesis, Self-Assembled Property, Drug Release, and In Vitro Efficiency.

PURPOSE: A cell-targeted prodrug with good self-assembly properties in aqueous solution was prepared for the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel, offering great potential for further investigation. METHODS: We synthesized hyaluronic acid (HA) with a specific targeting property as a carrier to conjugate with paclitaxel by inserting different amino acids as spacers, including valine, leucine, and phenylalanine, respectively. The structure of HA-amino acid-paclitaxel conjugates was characterized by (1)H NMR and GPC. The loading weight and hydrolysis rate were detected by UV and HPLC, respectively. Their morphology and mean diameter were investigated by SEM and DLS, respectively. The biological activity of HA-amino acid-paclitaxel conjugates was measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry using MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: The use of amino acids as spacers between drug and carrier facilitated paclitaxel release from the conjugates. Their morphology demonstrated that the prepared prodrugs could self-assemble to form nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution and spherical shape. Furthermore, the prodrugs exhibited increased cytotoxicity as compared to free drug. Flow cytometry analysis showed that MCF-7 cells treated with conjugates were arrested in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Prodrugs synthesized as HA-amino acid-paclitaxel conjugates exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines and hence may have potential application as tumor-specific nanoparticulate therapeutic agents.</docText>

        <docText>Diagnostic performance of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography of breast cancer in detecting axillary lymph node metastasis: comparison with ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) in comparison with that of ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in detecting axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with invasive breast cancer were recruited. They had received no neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent PET/CT, ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT before mastectomy. The clinical stage was I in 34 patients, II in 15 patients, and III in one patient. The images of these modalities were interpreted in usual practice before surgery and the diagnostic reports were reviewed for analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each modality were obtained taking histopathological results of axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy as the reference standard. RESULTS: Axillary lymph node metastasis was confirmed in 15 of 50 patients by histopathological studies. PET/CT identified lymph node metastasis in three of these 15 patients. The overall sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PET/CT in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis were 20, 97, 75, and 74%, and those of ultrasonography were 33, 94, 71, and 77% and those of contrast-enhanced CT were 27, 97, 80, and 76%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT showed poor sensitivity and high specificity in the detection of axillary lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. Diagnostic performance of PET/CT was not superior to that of ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT.</docText>

        <docText>Axitinib-a selective inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor.

An improved understanding of the molecular biology involved in many solid tumors has led to the development of novel targeted agents. Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinases 1, 2, and 3. This review presents preclinical and clinical data available for axitinib, including findings from key phase II clinical trials in a wide variety of tumors including melanomas and renal, pancreatic, thyroid, breast, lung, and colorectal carcinomas. The differences between axitinib and other VEGFR inhibitors are explored and details of the possible use of blood pressure elevation and erythropoietin blood levels as predictive markers of VEGF/VEGFR pathway inhibition are outlined. Ongoing Phase III studies in pancreatic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma should help to determine the optimum utilization of these agents at the appropriate stage of disease.</docText>

        <docText>Breast cancer with synchronous massive metastasis in the uterine cervix: a case report and review of the literature.

INTRODUCTION: Metastatic breast cancer is rare in the female genital tract, and when present it more commonly tends to involve ovary or endometrium; uterine cervix is only occasionally involved. This condition poses differential diagnostic problems in the settings of clinical and pathological investigations. CASE PRESENTATION: An asymptomatic 78-year-old woman came to our attention in the context of routine gynecological surveillance; clinical examination disclosed enlarged uterine body and cervix. Our patient then underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging that outlined the possibility of cervical cancer with parametrial involvement. Moreover, a suspect mass was found on the mammogram in the left breast. Breast surgical excision was performed, which revealed invasive breast carcinoma, while synchronous cervical biopsy discovered distant metastasis in the uterine cervix. On histological examination, both lesions showed non-cohesive architectural pattern consistent with lobular morphology; anyway, to rule out primary poorly differentiated cervical cancer, appropriate immunohistochemical panel was performed, which confirmed the mammary derivation of the tumor. Due to disseminate disease, the patient underwent multisystemic medical treatment including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, and she is still alive at 30-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Genital tract metastases in patients with known breast carcinoma can present with abnormal vaginal bleeding, but they often are asymptomatic. Therefore, only strict gynecological surveillance of these patients can permit early detection of these secondary lesions. Aggressive treatment of isolated cervical metastasis should be performed when feasible; otherwise, systemic chemotherapy with taxane could be sufficient in increasing survival. It should be emphasized that, in most cases, only accurate immunohistochemical investigation, particularly if performed on the primary lesion as well, can solve differential diagnostic problems and allow the clinician to establish appropriate treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis despite careful correction of hyponatremia: clinical and neuropathological findings of a case.

We report clinical, radiological and pathological findings in a patient with central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis. The patient was a 61-year-old woman who had a radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Based on clinical evidence, acute hyponatremia had set in only a few days before onset of symptoms. The patient's disease progressed in two stages and became more severe during slow hyponatremia correction after 9 days from onset. Diffusion MRI provided early evidence of neurological lesions. In spite of a therapeutic attempt, the patient died unexpectedly 18 days after onset of her neurological disease due to massive pulmonary embolism. Histologically, our findings confirmed that the major features of central pontine myelinolysis in the acute stage are demyelination, the presence of large amounts of macrophages with no lymphocytic inflammatory reaction, and moderate astrocytosis. It is interesting to note that a monotypic immunological reaction persisted 19 days after radiological demonstration of parenchymal alterations.</docText>

        <docText>Reduction of nontarget infection and systemic toxicity by targeted delivery of conditionally replicating viruses transported in mesenchymal stem cells.

The fiber-modified adenoviral vector Delta-24-RGD (D24RGD) offers vast therapeutic potential. Direct injection of D24RGD has been used to successfully target ovarian tumors in mice. However, systemic toxicity, especially in the liver, profoundly limits the efficacy of direct viral vector delivery. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the ability to function as a vector for targeted gene therapy because of their preferential engraftment into solid tumors and participation in tumor stroma formation. We show that MSC-guided delivery of D24RGD is specific and efficient and reduces the overall systemic toxicity in mice to negligible levels compared with D24RGD alone. In our model, we found efficient targeted delivery of MSC-D24RGD to both breast and ovarian cell lines. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for adenoviral hexon protein confirmed negligible levels of systemic toxicity in mice that were administered MSC-D24RGD compared with those that were administered D24RGD. These data suggest that delivery of D24RGD through MSC not only increases the targeted delivery efficiency, but also reduces the systemic exposure of the virus, thereby reducing overall systemic toxicity to the host and ultimately enhancing its value as an anti-tumor therapeutic candidate.Cancer Gene Therapy advance online publication, 30 October 2009; doi:10.1038/cgt.2009.67.</docText>

        <docTitle>Correlation between Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations and Expression of Female Hormone Receptors in East-Asian Lung Adenocarcinomas.</docTitle>
        <docText>Correlation between Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations and Expression of Female Hormone Receptors in East-Asian Lung Adenocarcinomas.

INTRODUCTION:: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are more common in lung adenocarcinoma and in female patients of East-Asian origin. We aimed to assess the expression of female hormone receptors in East-Asian lung adenocarcinomas, their correlation with EGFR mutations, and prognostic significance. METHODS:: Estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, ERbeta, progesterone receptor (PR), and Her-2 expression were examined using immunohistochemical methods on 109 lung adenocarcinoma cases. EGFR mutations were analyzed by partially denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. Association of hormone receptor with clinical factors was assessed using the Fisher's exact test. Associations with survival were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS:: Using scoring criteria routinely used for breast cancer, there were four (4%) ERalpha, one (1%) ERbeta, six (6%) PR, and one (1%) Her-2 positive cases. Considering any staining as positive, 14 (14%) ERalpha, 10 (9%) ERbeta, 12 (12%) PR, and 26 (24%) Her-2 cases were positive. Thirty-nine patients (39%) had EGFR mutations. ERalpha positivity was significantly associated with ERbeta and PR positivity. There were more EGFR mutations seen in tumors with ERss positivity (60%) compared with those with negative expression (37.9%), and there was a trend toward a poorer outcome for patients with tumor that were positive for ERss and Her-2. CONCLUSIONS:: We found that ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and Her-2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma are present but limited. This suggests that hormonal influence may not be an important factor to account for the high prevalence of lung cancer among the East-Asian women.</docText>

        <docTitle>Immunohistochemical Expression of Estrogen Receptor in Adenocarcinomas of the Lung: The Antibody Factor.</docTitle>
        <docText>Immunohistochemical Expression of Estrogen Receptor in Adenocarcinomas of the Lung: The Antibody Factor.

BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor may be used to distinguish metastatic breast cancers from adenocarcinomas of other sites, including those of the lung. The estrogen receptor exists as 2 subtypes, alpha and beta. Estrogen receptor alpha is the predominant subtype expressed by more than two-thirds of human breast cancers. Adenocarcinomas of lung origin may also express estrogen receptor, primarily the beta subtype. Human estrogen receptor alpha is highly homologous to estrogen receptor beta and consequently, antibodies used to detect estrogen receptor alpha in breast carcinomas may detect estrogen receptor beta in pulmonary adenocarcinomas. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor in proven primary lung adenocarcinomas using 3 anti-estrogen receptor alpha antibodies: mouse monoclonal 1D5, 6F11, and rabbit monoclonal SP1. DESIGN: Ninety-two pulmonary adenocarcinomas (53 women and 39 men) confirmed by clinical presentation and positive immunohistochemistry for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) were included in this study. There were 19 incisional biopsies and 73 excisional specimens. Immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor using antibodies 1D5, 6F11, and SP1 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue following antigen retrieval. Any nuclear reactivity for estrogen receptor was considered a positive result. RESULT: Focal positive nuclear reaction for estrogen receptor was detected in 7 (7.6%) cases of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma using antibody 1D5, 13 (14.1%) using 6F11, and 25 (27.2%) using SP1. The differences in reactivity for estrogen receptor in pulmonary adenocarcinomas between SP1 and 1D5, and between SP1 and 6F11 were statistically significant (P&lt;0.001). Positive cases showed only a focal pattern of staining with each of the 3 antibodies. There was no significant difference in reactivity for estrogen receptor in pulmonary adenocarcinomas of men and women. Positive staining was highest in nonmucinous bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinomas for all of the antibodies, and for SP1, variation by histologic subtype was significant (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SP1 has a significantly higher detection rate for the expression of estrogen receptor in pulmonary adenocarcinomas when compared with either 1D5 or 6F11. Caution should therefore be exercised in the use of this antibody alone in distinguishing a metastatic breast from a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.</docText>

        <docTitle>Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, and Glucocorticoid Receptor Expression in Normal Breast Tissue, Breast In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Breast Cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, and Glucocorticoid Receptor Expression in Normal Breast Tissue, Breast In Situ Carcinoma, and Invasive Breast Cancer.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used in cancer treatment to induce programmed cell death in transformed cells of the hematopoietic system and to lessen side effects. Moreover, GCs have been described not only as inhibitors of some chemotherapy or radiation-induced apoptosis, but also as inhibitors of cancer progression by down-regulation or up-regulation of different gene expressions. Recently, it has been suggested that GCs can attenuate estrogen responses through induction of expression and activity of the sulfotransferase. The presence or absence of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in normal and abnormal breast tissue is thus interesting, and the aim of this study was to analyze the expression of GR during the progression of breast tissue. We tested by immunohistochemistry the expression status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and GR in normal breast parenchyma (n=49), ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN) 1a (n=9), DIN 1b-1c (n=15), DIN 2-3 (n=21), and invasive breast carcinoma (n=39). The evaluation of GR expression was made by using the Allred score. All the normal parenchyma, DIN 1a, DIN 1b, and DIN 1c were ER-positive (ER) and PR-positive (PR). Seventeen of 21 DIN 2-3 and 30 of 39 invasive carcinomas were ER/PR. The other samples were ER-negative (ER) and PR-negative (PR). Moreover, all the ER/PR samples were GR-negative. Interestingly, we found a significant correlation between the histologic grade and the GR-negative tumors, and a percentage of positive patients presented with nuclear immunoreaction to GR, which decreases significantly with tumor histologic grade. Understanding the role of GCs in breast carcinoma is thus essential before continuing the widespread use of GCs combined with antineoplastic drugs or agents in the clinical management of women with breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>MicroRNA-125a represses cell growth by targeting HuR in breast cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of naturally occurring, small, non-coding RNAs that control gene expression during development, normal cell function and disease. Although there is emerging evidence that some miRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, there is limited understanding of the role of miRNAs in cancer. In this study, we observed that the expression of miR-125a was inversely correlated with HuR expression in several different breast carcinoma cell lines. HuR is a stress-induced RNA binding protein whose expression is elevated or localization perturbed in several different cancers. Increased cytoplasmic localization of HuR is a prognostic marker in breast cancer. Real time PCR and gene reporter assays indicated that HuR was translationally repressed by miR-125a. Re-establishing miR-125a expression in breast cancer cells decreased HuR protein level and inhibited cell growth. Using MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we further clarified that miR-125a inhibited cell growth via a dramatic suppression of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis. In addition, cell migration was also inhibited by miR-125a overexpression. Importantly, the repression of cell proliferation and migration engendered by miR-125a was partly rescued by HuR re-expression. Our results suggest that miR-125a may function as a tumor suppressor for breast cancer, with HuR as a direct and functional target.</docText>

        <docTitle>A statistical change point model approach for the detection of DNA copy number variations in array CGH data.</docTitle>
        <docText>A statistical change point model approach for the detection of DNA copy number variations in array CGH data.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a high-resolution and high-throughput technique for screening of copy number variations (CNVs) within the entire genome. This technique, compared to the conventional CGH, significantly improves the identification of chromosomal abnormalities. However, due to the random noise inherited in the imaging and hybridization process, identifying statistically significant DNA copy number changes in aCGH data is challenging. We propose a novel approach that uses the mean and variance change point model (MVCM) to detect CNVs or breakpoints in aCGH data sets. We derive an approximate p-value for the test statistic and also give the estimate of the locus of the DNA copy number change. We carry out simulation studies to evaluate the accuracy of the estimate and the p-value formulation. These simulation results show that the approach is effective in identifying copy number changes. The approach is also tested on fibroblast cancer cell line data, breast tumor cell line data, and breast cancer cell line aCGH data sets that are publicly available. Changes that have not been identified by the circular binary segmentation (CBS) method but are biologically verified are detected by our approach on these cell lines with higher sensitivity and specificity than CBS.</docText>

        <docText>Effects of chronic hepatitis C infection on the treatment of breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Although hepatitis C (HCV) is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, little information exists about treatment of breast cancer in the setting of chronic HCV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The databases of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Tumor Registry, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, and Department of Laboratory Medicine were cross-referenced for patients with breast cancer, who were also identified as having HCV. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, breast cancer treatment at MDACC, and a diagnosis of HCV. RESULTS: During chemotherapy, 25% of patients experienced elevations in aminotransferases and 44% of patients required dose reductions/delays in chemotherapy. More than 60% of the patients who received chemotherapy demonstrated a grade 2 or greater complication. However, 92% of patients were able to complete the number of cycles specified in the initial chemotherapy plan. CONCLUSIONS: As the majority of these breast cancer patients completed the initial chemotherapy plan, this study indicates that breast cancer patients with HCV can be treated with cytotoxic therapy. Comparison with historical controls showed similar rates of hepatic toxicity in the presence (or absence) of HCV, indicating that incidence of transaminitis may not be significantly affected by HCV.</docText>

        <docText>Pathological and molecular characteristics distinguishing contralateral metastatic from new primary breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients have a cumulative lifetime risk of 2%-15% of developing a contralateral metastatic or ex novo primary cancer. From prognostic and therapeutic viewpoints, it is important to differentiate metastatic from second primary. To distinguish these entities, we investigated whether the pattern of X chromosome inactivation could determine whether the two tumors derived from different progenitor cells. Materials and methods: The clonality of bilateral breast cancer was evaluated through the X-inactivation analysis using the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) polymorphism and the histopathologic and molecular results were compared. A different or an identical pattern of X inactivation was considered as indicator of a second primary cancer or not informative, respectively. We considered morphological indicators of a new primary cancer the absence of concordance in the histological type or a better histological differentiation. RESULTS: Ten patients with bilateral breast cancer were evaluated. Morphological criteria indicated that eight were second primary, a conclusion confirmed by the X-inactivation analysis. Two cases classified as recurrence according to morphological criteria were classified as second tumor by molecular analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the HUMARA clonality assay can improve the histological parameters in differentiating metastatic cancer from second primary cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Patterns of care in Dutch postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer participating in the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.

BACKGROUND: The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial investigates the efficacy and safety of adjuvant exemestane alone and in sequence after tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer. As there was a nationwide participation in The Netherlands, we studied the variations in patterns of care in the Comprehensive Cancer Centre Regions (CCCRs) and compliance with national guidelines. METHODS: Clinicopathological characteristics, carried out local treatment strategies and adjuvant chemotherapy data were collected. RESULTS: From 2001 to January 2006, 2754 Dutch patients were randomised to the study. Mean age of patients was 65 years (standard deviation 9). Tumours were &lt;/=2 cm in 46% (within CCCRs 39%-50%), node-negative disease varied from 25% to 45%, and PgR status was determined in 75%-100% of patients. Mastectomy was carried out in 55% (45%-70%), sentinel lymph node procedure in 68% (42%-79%) and axillary lymph node dissections in 77% (67%-83%) of patients, all different between CCCRs (P &lt; 0.0001). Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 15%-70% of eligible patients (P &lt; 0.001). Discussion: In spite of national guidelines, breast cancer treatment on specific issues widely varied between the various Dutch regions. These data provide valuable information for breast cancer organisations indicating (lack of) guideline adherence and areas for breast cancer care improvement.</docText>

        <docTitle>Sinusal localization of nodal micrometastases is a prognostic factor in breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Sinusal localization of nodal micrometastases is a prognostic factor in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer micrometastases are frequently found during pathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes and complete axillary lymph node dissection. Despite this, their clinical relevance is still debated. The aim of this study is to investigate features that affect disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with nodal micrometastases from breast cancer. Material and methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcome of 122 patients with nodal micrometastases from breast cancer followed up for 60 months. RESULTS: At univariate analysis, worse DFS was related to features of primary tumor (multifocality P = 0.002; size &gt;2 cm, P = 0.022; grade P = 0.022; absence of estrogen P &lt; 0.001 and progesterone P &lt; 0.001 receptors; HER-2 overexpression P = 0.006; vascular invasion P = 0.039; proliferative fraction &gt;/=20% P = 0.034) and micrometastases (sinusal localization P = 0.010). Among the above-mentioned features, two were strongly associated with worse DFS in the multivariate model, i.e. negative receptorial status [hazard ratio (HR) = 11.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.06-31.09; P &lt; 0.001] and sinusal localization of micrometastasis (HR = 3.66, 1.18-11.36; P = 0.025). The OS was influenced by multifocality (P &lt; 0.001) and receptor status (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that in patients affected by breast cancer, in addition to the well-known pathological features of primary tumor, sinusal localization of micrometastasis strongly impacts on the prognosis.</docText>

        <docText>Activity of fulvestrant in HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression increases the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells resulting in poorer prognosis. Patients with HER2-positive disease are less responsive to endocrine therapies. Trastuzumab monotherapy results in objective responses in only approximately 15% of patients. Fulvestrant retains activity in cells overexpressing HER2 that are resistant to other endocrine treatments. This retrospective study evaluated response to fulvestrant treatment among HER2-positive patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical experience data from 10 treatment centres were pooled. Postmenopausal patients with predominantly hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive disease were included. Clinical benefit (CB) was defined as the proportion of patients achieving a response to treatment (partial or complete) or stable disease lasting &gt;/=6 months. RESULTS: Data for 102 patients were analysed. Fulvestrant resulted in an overall CB rate of 42% (43/101) in HER2-positive patients and 40% (25/63) in patients with visceral disease. Median duration of treatment was 14.5 months (range 6-44 months). Fulvestrant showed activity up to the fourth line of endocrine therapy and up to the seventh line of overall therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that fulvestrant may be a suitable treatment option in extensively pre-treated patients with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive ABC. Further exploration of its use in this patient population is warranted.</docText>

        <docTitle>Mammographic screening and risk factors for breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Mammographic screening and risk factors for breast cancer.

Screening mammography can distort estimated effects in breast cancer risk models due to associations with other risk factors. Mammography information was available in the Nurses' Health Study from 1988, and 1,815 incident breast cancers were accrued through 2000 among 55,625 women with risk factor data. Logistic models were fit for screening mammography, and inverse probability weighting was used to adjust parameters in an established breast cancer risk model. Approximately 80% of women in each 2-year follow-up period had screening mammograms, which were positively associated with history of benign breast disease, family history of breast cancer, hormone therapy, alcohol use, physical activity, multivitamins, and calcium supplements, and negatively associated with postmenopause, current smoking, and body mass index. Markers of medical attention, including hypertension, high cholesterol, and osteoarthritis, were positively associated, while cardiovascular disease was negative. Inverse probability weighting led to small changes in effects of benign breast disease, family history, and hormone therapy. An apparent reduced risk associated with current smoking in unadjusted models was eliminated after weighting. Thus, several risk factors for breast cancer and cancer diagnosis are associated with mammographic screening. Adjustment for screening had some impact on breast cancer prediction in this cohort, especially for hormone therapy and smoking.</docText>

        <docText>Concomitant suppression of three target genes can explain the impact of a microRNA on metastasis.

It remains unclear whether a microRNA (miRNA) affects a given phenotype via concomitant down-regulation of its entire repertoire of targets or instead by suppression of only a modest subset of effectors. We demonstrate that inhibition of breast cancer metastasis by miR-31-a miRNA predicted to modulate &gt;200 mRNAs-can be entirely explained by miR-31's pleiotropic regulation of three targets. Thus, concurrent re-expression of integrin-alpha5, radixin, and RhoA abrogates miR-31-imposed metastasis suppression. These effectors influence distinct steps of the metastatic process. Our findings have implications concerning the importance of pleiotropy for the biological actions of miRNAs and provide mechanistic insights into metastasis.</docText>

        <docText>Two modules in the BRC repeats of BRCA2 mediate structural and functional interactions with the RAD51 recombinase.

The breast and ovarian cancer suppressor protein BRCA2 controls the RAD51 recombinase in reactions that lead to homologous DNA recombination (HDR). BRCA2 binds RAD51 via eight conserved BRC repeat motifs of approximately 35 amino acids, each with a varying capacity to bind RAD51. BRC repeats both promote and inhibit RAD51 assembly on different DNA substrates to regulate HDR, but the structural basis for these functions is unclear. Here, we demarcate two tetrameric clusters of hydrophobic residues in the BRC repeats, interacting with distinct pockets in RAD51, and show that the co-location of both modules within a single BRC repeat is necessary for BRC-RAD51 binding and function. The two modules comprise the sequence FxxA, known to inhibit RAD51 assembly by blocking the oligomerization interface, and a previously unrecognized tetramer with the consensus sequence LFDE, which binds to a RAD51 pocket distinct from this interface. The LFDE motif is essential in BRC repeats for modes of RAD51 binding both permissive and inhibitory to RAD51 oligomerization. Targeted insertion of point mutations in RAD51 that disrupt the LFDE-binding pocket impair its assembly at DNA damage sites in living cells. Our findings suggest a model for the modular architecture of BRC repeats that provides fresh insight into the mechanisms regulating homologous DNA recombination.</docText>

        <docText>Performance of computer-aided detection applied to full-field digital mammography in detection of breast cancers.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in detection of breast cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAD was retrospectively applied to standard mammographic views of 127 cases with biopsy proven breast cancers detected with FFDM (Senographe 2000, GE Medical Systems). CAD sensitivity was assessed in total group of 127 cases and for subgroups based on breast density, mammographic lesion type, mammographic lesion size, histopathology and mode of presentation. RESULTS: Overall CAD sensitivity was 91% (115 of 127 cases). There were no statistical differences (p&gt;0.1) in CAD detection of cancers in dense breasts 90% (53/59) versus non-dense breasts 91% (62/68). There was statistical difference (p&lt;0.05) in CAD detection of cancers that appeared mammographically as microcalcifications only versus other mammographic manifestations. CAD detected 100% (44/44) of cancers manifesting as microcalcifications, 89% (47/53) as no-calcified masses or asymmetries, 88% (14/16) as masses with associated calcifications, and 71% (10/14) as architectural distortions. CAD sensitivity for cancers 1-10mm was 84% (38/45); 11-20mm 93% (55/59); and &gt;20mm 97% (22/23). CONCLUSION: CAD applied to FFDM showed 100% sensitivity in identifying cancers manifesting as microcalcifications only and high sensitivity 86% (71/83) for other mammographic appearances of cancer. Sensitivity is influenced by lesion size. CAD in FFDM is an adjunct helping radiologist in early detection of breast cancers.</docText>

        <docText>Association of expression of MRP1, BCRP, LRP and ERCC1 with outcome of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic value of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), lung resistance-related protein (LRP) and excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Transbronchial biopsy (TBB) specimens from 46 patients with stage IIIA (N(2)) NSCLC were collected to determine the expression level of MRP1, BCRP, LRP and ERCC1 mRNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The expression level of each gene was analyzed in relation to histopathologic response to chemotherapy, and tumor-free survival (TFS) and overall survival. RESULTS: Patients with MRP1 or LRP low expression had a significantly better histopathologic response (P=0.032 and 0.006), and a significantly longer TFS (P=0.043 and 0.025) and overall survival (P=0.019 and 0.013) than those with MRP1 or LRP high expression. Patients with ERCC1 low expression had a significantly longer overall survival (P=0.007), but not TFS (P=0.094) than those with ERCC1 high expression. In multivariate analysis, LRP low expression was a significantly favorable factor for TFS (P=0.027), and LRP and ERCC1 were significantly favorable factors for overall survival (P=0.012 and 0.032). CONCLUSION: Assessment of MRP1 and LRP mRNA expression in TBB specimens may predict histopathologic response and survival in locally advanced NSCLC patients who received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. ERCC1 expression was predictive for overall survival.</docText>

        <docTitle>Accurate molecular classification of cancer using simple rules.</docTitle>
        <docText>Accurate molecular classification of cancer using simple rules.

BACKGROUND: One intractable problem with using microarray data analysis for cancer classification is how to reduce the extremely high-dimensionality gene feature data to remove the effects of noise. Feature selection is often used to address this problem by selecting informative genes from among thousands or tens of thousands of genes. However, most of the existing methods of microarray-based cancer classification utilize too many genes to achieve accurate classification, which often hampers the interpretability of the models. For a better understanding of the classification results, it is desirable to develop simpler rule-based models with as few marker genes as possible. METHODS: We screened a small number of informative single genes and gene pairs on the basis of their depended degrees proposed in rough sets. Applying the decision rules induced by the selected genes or gene pairs, we constructed cancer classifiers. We tested the efficacy of the classifiers by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) of training sets and classification of independent test sets. RESULTS: We applied our methods to five cancerous gene expression datasets: leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs. acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia (ALL vs. mixed-lineage leukemia [MLL] vs. AML). Accurate classification outcomes were obtained by utilizing just one or two genes. Some genes that correlated closely with the pathogenesis of relevant cancers were identified. In terms of both classification performance and algorithm simplicity, our approach outperformed or at least matched existing methods. CONCLUSION: In cancerous gene expression datasets, a small number of genes, even one or two if selected correctly, is capable of achieving an ideal cancer classification effect. This finding also means that very simple rules may perform well for cancerous class prediction.</docText>

        <docText>PD 0332991, a selective cyclin D kinase 4/6 inhibitor, preferentially inhibits proliferation of luminal estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cell lines in vitro.

ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Alterations in cell-cycle regulators have been implicated in human malignancies including breast cancers. PD 0332991 is an orally active, highly selective inhibitor of the cyclin D kinase (CDK)4 and CDK6 kinases with ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. To identify predictors of response, we determined the in vitro sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly characterized human breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: 47 human breast cancer and immortalized lines representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated with PD 0332991 to determine IC50 values. These data were analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with PD 0332991 response. RESULTS: Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while non-luminal/basal subtypes were most resistant. ANOVA identified 450 differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and Cyclin D1 were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was decreased in the most sensitive lines. Cell cycle analysis showed G0/G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is blocked in sensitive lines but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER2 amplified cell lines, respectively. PD 0332991 enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen in cell lines with conditioned resistance to ER blockade. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest a role for CDK4/6 inhibition in some breast cancers and identify criteria for patient selection in clinical studies of PD 0332991.</docText>

        <docText>Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in the treatment of breast cancer.

This article reviews the use of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Estimates of efficacy from systematic reviews, based on several randomized trials, are provided. These show that LHRH agonists can reduce the risk of recurrence and death, and can be an alternative to chemotherapy, particularly for women who would like to avoid early menopause. The benefits can be seen 10 or 15 years later. The main side effects - hot flashes and reduction in bone density - often recede once treatment stops. Ongoing research will provide information about LHRH agonists when used with modern chemotherapy regimens and aromatase inhibitors.</docText>

        <docText>Erymildbraedin A and B, two novel cytotoxic dimethylpyrano-isoflavones from the stem bark of Erythrina mildbraedii: evaluation of their activity toward endocrine cancer cells.

Two new dimethylpyrano-isoflavones, named erymildbraedin A (4) and B (5), were isolated from the stem bark of the Cameroonian medicinal plant Erythrina mildbraedii, along with four known ones, the linear congeners, scandenone (1), erysenegalinsein M (2), 5,4'-dihydroxy-2'-methoxy-8-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-2'',2''-dimethylpyrano[5,6:6,7]isoflavone (3), and the angular isoflavone eryvarin B (6), and two other compounds, fraxidin and scoparone. Their structures were elucidated by the usual spectroscopic methods and isoflavone effects on the growth of human breast, prostate, and endometrial adenocarcinoma cells were determined. Isoflavones 1, 3, and 6 strongly inhibited the growth of all three cell lines, supporting the notion that a non-oxidized isoprenyl group at C-8 is requisite for cytotoxic activity.</docText>

        <docTitle>Depression symptoms and health-related quality of life among patients with metastatic breast cancer in programme of palliative cancer care.</docTitle>
        <docText>Depression symptoms and health-related quality of life among patients with metastatic breast cancer in programme of palliative cancer care.

Depression is seen in many cancer patients. It occurs in approximately 25% of palliative care patients. The quality of life term contains the information on an individual's physical social and spiritual condition. The study evaluated incidence and relevance of depression symptoms and level of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with metastatic breast cancer in programme of palliative cancer care. This study was local prospective and cross-sectional. It was carried at Department of Clinical Oncology and Radiation Therapy of Charles University Hospital in Hrader Králové, Czech Republic. Dates were obtained during year 2008 among 41 patients with metastatic breast cancer in programme of palliative cancer care. The mean age for all 41 subjects was 58 years old (aged 41 - 80 years old). The Czech version of Zung self-rating depression scale was performed for evaluation of depression symptoms. The Czech version of genetic EuroQol questionnaire EQ-5D was performed for evaluation of level of HRQoL. The statistical evaluation presents that mean ZSDS (Zung self-rating depression score) certifies the presence of signs of moderately depression symptoms among patients with metastatic breast cancer (ZSDS range was 60-69). The mean ZSDS in all patients was 60,6. The mean ZSDS is group of healthy females was 38,9 (normal range of ZSDS). The incidence of depression was 61% (25 of all 41 subjects). The relevance of depression is characterized: severely depressed was proved in 5 of all 25 subjects, the moderately depressed in 10 subjects of all 25 subjects and mildly depressed in 10 of all 25 subjects. The statistical evaluation not presents statistically significant dependence of ZSDS on age, number of associated diseases and type of palliative cancer care. The HRQoL among patients with metastatic breast cancer is on very low level. The mean EQ-5D score (dimension of quality of life) was 55%. The mean EQ-5D VAS (subjective health condition) was 59,2%. The mean EQ-5D score in group of healthy female was 78,4% and the mean EQ-5D VAS was 85% (both QoL parameters show very good of QoL level). The statistical evaluation not presents statistically significant dependence of EQ-5D score and EQ-5D VAS on age, number of associated diseases and type of palliative cancer care. The results showed that subsist clear association between metastatic breast cancer in programme of palliative cancer care and depression. Also, the results showed that subsist low level of HRQoL of patients with metastatic breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Recent advances in multivalent self adjuvanting glycolipopeptide vaccine strategies against breast cancer.

Breast cancer (BrCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for women worldwide. Evidence from both patients and mouse cancer models suggests that the simultaneous induction of BrCa-specific CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells, and antibodies is crucial for providing immune resistance. However, almost all current vaccines address only a single arm of the immune system, which may explain their lack of efficacy. We believe that the correct response to monovalent vaccines' "failure" is to increase our knowledge about antitumor protective immunity and to develop a multivalent vaccine molecule that can simultaneously induce multiple arms of the immune system. We highlight here recent advances in anti-BrCa peptide-based vaccine strategies with an emphasis on the self adjuvanting multivalent glycolipopeptide vaccine strategy recently developed in our laboratory and which showed promising results in both immunotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic settings.</docText>

        <docText>Functional Analysis of Familial Asp67Glu and Thr1051Ser BRCA1 Mutations in Breast/Ovarian Carcinogenesis.

Estrogen is believed to be pre-initiator in the risk of breast cancer. The BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene associated with breast and ovarian cancer risk. This report describes functional analysis of two BRCA1 missense mutations (Asp67Glu and Thr1051Ser) observed in the familial breast/ovarian cancer patients in Thailand. Levels of luciferase activity of the two mutations were relatively lower than in the wild-type BRCA1. It is indicated that mutants may fail to promote the estrogen receptor dependent functions. It is presumed that estrogen and insulin/IGF-1 regulate c-Myc and cyclin D1 during breast cancer cell proliferation. It is also likely to affect ubiquitination mechanism. Since three affected cancer families carry the Asp67Glu mutation, it is believed that this type of mutation could have some effect on breast/ovarian cancer progression.</docText>

        <docText>Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Activities of Centella asiatica (L) Urb.

In the present study, the phenolic (Folin-Dennis) and flavonoid (colorimetric assay) constituents, antioxidant [2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) assay] and cytotoxic activities of an aqueous extract (AE) of Centella asiatica leaves were investigated. The aqueous extract (50 g/L) was obtained by infusion followed by cold maceration for 24 h. The levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds were 2.86 g/100 g and 0.361 g/100 g, respectively. The AE showed elevated DPPH scavenging activity, with an IC(50) value of 31.25 mug/mL. The AE had a promising activity against mouse melanoma (B(16)F(1)), human breast cancer (MDA MB-231) and rat glioma (C(6)) cell lines, with IC(50) values of 698.0, 648.0 and 1000.0 mug/mL, respectively. A positive correlation was established between the level of flavonoids, antioxidant and antitumor activities.</docText>

        <docText>Investigation of the miR16-1 (C &gt; T) + 7 Substitution in Seven Different Types of Cancer from Three Ethnic Groups.

Background. MicroRNAs are a type of small noncoding RNA molecules that have been shown to control gene expression in eukaryotes. Aberrant expression and alteration of miRNAs may be responsible for human diseases including cancer. An miR16-1 (C &gt; T) + 7 gene mutation has been previously found in familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, one of which reported a family history of breast cancer. miR16-1 regulates the expression of bcl-2, which is important in retinoblastoma, and is located in a genomic region that is frequently lost in nasopharyngeal and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Therefore, miR16-1 may be potentially important in the etiology of several solid tumors. To understand the power of the miR16-1 (C &gt; T) + 7 mutation as a prognostic and diagnostic risk factor, we investigated the mutation in patients with seven different types of cancer including 188 with breast, 102 with ovarian, and 22 nasopharyngeal carcinomas, 96 HCC, 872 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 39 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 46 retinoblastoma cases from three different ethnic groups and of hereditary and sporadic etiology. Methods. 5'Nuclease TaqMan SNP genotyping assay was used to detect the miR16-1 gene C &gt; T substitution. Results. The miR16-1 (C &gt; T) + 7 substitution was not detected in any of the groups studied. Conclusions. Considering the large scale of our study, the representation of different ethnicities and levels of hereditary risk, we conclude that the miR-16-1 (C &gt; T) + 7 mutation is not a good diagnostic or prognostic indicator of risk for the cancers tested.</docText>

        <docText>Conducting Molecular Epidemiological Research in the Age of HIPAA: A Multi-Institutional Case-Control Study of Breast Cancer in African-American and European-American Women.

Breast cancer in African-American (AA) women occurs at an earlier age than in European-American (EA) women and is more likely to have aggressive features associated with poorer prognosis, such as high-grade and negative estrogen receptor (ER) status. The mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown. To address this, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate risk factors for high-grade ER- disease in both AA and EA women. With the onset of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, creative measures were needed to adapt case ascertainment and contact procedures to this new environment of patient privacy. In this paper, we report on our approach to establishing a multicenter study of breast cancer in New York and New Jersey, provide preliminary distributions of demographic and pathologic characteristics among case and control participants by race, and contrast participation rates by approaches to case ascertainment, with discussion of strengths and weaknesses.</docText>

        <docText>Intraoperative Touch Imprint and Frozen Section Analysis of Sentinel Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer.

OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the accuracy of touch imprint and frozen section analysis of sentinel nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: Intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel node can determine the need for axillary dissection at the time of initial operation and therefore spare the patient a second operation. Little data, however, exists on the accuracy of intraoperative evaluation of sentinel nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS:: A retrospective chart review was performed of all sentinel node procedures for breast cancer from 2004 to 2008 at a single institution. The sentinel node procedure was done before (no-NACT) chemotherapy in 107 patients and 37 had the procedure after neoadjuvant (NACT) chemotherapy. Intraoperative analysis of sentinel nodes was performed using touch imprint and frozen section techniques. RESULTS:: In the no-NACT group, intraoperative assessment by touch imprint analysis had 61% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 87% accuracy. Frozen section analysis was similar with 74% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 90% accuracy. In the NACT group, touch imprint analysis had 79% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 90% accuracy. Frozen section analysis was again similar with 74% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 83% accuracy. When the no-NACT group and the NACT group were compared, both frozen section and touch imprint analysis had similar sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS:: Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel nodes with touch imprint and frozen section analysis in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Nearly all of the misses in intraoperative evaluation were in patients with micrometastases.</docText>

        <docText>Using surface imaging and visual coaching to improve the reproducibility and stability of deep-inspiration breath hold for left-breast-cancer radiotherapy.

Late cardiac complications may arise after left-breast radiation therapy. Deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH) allows reduction of the irradiated heart volume at the same time as it reduces tumor bed motion and increases lung sparing. In the present study, we have evaluated the improvement in reproducibility and stability of the DIBH for left-breast-cancer treatment when visual coaching is provided with the aid of 3D video surface imaging and video goggles. Five left-breast-cancer patients and fifteen healthy volunteers were asked to perform a series of DIBHs without and with visual coaching. Reproducibility and stability of DIBH were measured for each individual with and without visual coaching. The average reproducibility and stability changed from 2.1 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively, without visual feedback to 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm with visual feedback, showing a significant statistical difference (p &lt; 0.001 for reproducibility, p &lt; 0.01 for stability). Significant changes (&gt;2 mm) in reproducibility and stability were observed in 35% and 15% of the subjects, respectively. The average chest wall excursion of the DIBH with respect to the free breathing preceding the DIBH was found to be 11.3 mm. The reproducibility and stability of the DIBH improve significantly from the visual coaching provided to the patient, especially in those patients with poor reproducibility and stability.</docText>

        <docText>Breast US Computer-aided Diagnosis System: Robustness across Urban Populations in South Korea and the United States.

Purpose: To evaluate the robustness of a breast ultrasonographic (US) computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system in terms of its performance across different patient populations. Materials and Methods: Three US databases were analyzed for this study: one South Korean and two United States databases. All three databases were utilized in an institutional review board-approved and HIPAA-compliant manner. Round-robin analysis and independent testing were performed to evaluate the performance of a computerized breast cancer classification scheme across the databases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate performance differences. Results: The round-robin analyses of each database demonstrated similar results, with areas under the ROC curve ranging from 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.820, 0.918) to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95). The independent testing of each database, however, indicated that although the performances were similar, the range in areas under the ROC curve (from 0.79 [95% CI: 0.730, 0.842] to 0.87 [95% CI: 0.794, 0.923]) was wider than that with the round-robin tests. However, the only instances in which statistically significant differences in performance were demonstrated occurred when the Korean database was used in a testing capacity in independent testing. Conclusion: The few observed statistically significant differences in performance indicated that while the US features used by the system were useful across the databases, their relative importance differed. In practice, this means that a CAD system may need to be adjusted when applied to a different population. (c) RSNA, 2009.</docText>

        <docText>Variability in Interpretive Performance at Screening Mammography and Radiologists' Characteristics Associated with Accuracy.

Purpose: To identify radiologists' characteristics associated with interpretive performance in screening mammography. Materials and Methods: The study was approved by institutional review boards of University of Washington (Seattle, Wash) and institutions at seven Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium sites, informed consent was obtained, and procedures were HIPAA compliant. Radiologists who interpreted mammograms in seven U.S. regions completed a self-administered mailed survey; information on demographics, practice type, and experience in and perceptions of general radiology and breast imaging was collected. Survey data were linked to data on screening mammograms the radiologists interpreted between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2005, and included patient risk factors, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment, and follow-up breast cancer data. The survey was returned by 71% (257 of 364) of radiologists; in 56% (205 of 364) of the eligible radiologists, complete data on screening mammograms during the study period were provided; these data were used in the final analysis. An evaluation of whether the radiologists' characteristics were associated with recall rate, false-positive rate, sensitivity, or positive predictive value of recall (PPV(1)) of the screening examinations was performed with logistic regression models that were adjusted for patients' characteristics and radiologist-specific random effects. Results: Study radiologists interpreted 1 036 155 screening mammograms; 4961 breast cancers were detected. Median percentages and interquartile ranges, respectively, were as follows: recall rate, 9.3% and 6.3%-13.2%; false-positive rate, 8.9% and 5.9%-12.8%; sensitivity, 83.8% and 74.5%-92.3%; and PPV(1), 4.0% and 2.6%-5.9%. Wide variability in sensitivity was noted, even among radiologists with similar false-positive rates. In adjusted regression models, female radiologists or fellowship-trained radiologists had significantly higher recall and false-positive rates (P &lt; .05, all). Fellowship training in breast imaging was the only characteristic significantly associated with improved sensitivity (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.80; P &lt; .001) and the overall accuracy parameter (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 2.45; P = .028). Conclusion: Fellowship training in breast imaging may lead to improved cancer detection, but it is associated with higher false-positive rates. (c) RSNA, 2009.</docText>

3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is the major in vivo product of the acid-catalyzed oligomerization of indole-3-carbinol present in cruciferous vegetables, and it has been shown to exhibit anticancer properties. In this study, we assessed the effects of DIM on the metastasis of 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells. In vitro culture studies showed that DIM dose-dependently inhibited the migration, invasion, and adhesion of 4T1 cells at concentrations of 0-10 mumol/L without attendant changes in cell viability. In an in vivo lung metastasis model, 4T1 cells (2 x 10(5) cells/mouse) were injected into the tail veins of syngeneic female BALB/c mice. Beginning on the second day, the mice were subjected to gavage with 0-10 mg DIM/(kg body weight . d) for 13 d. Oral DIM administration resulted in a marked reduction in the number of pulmonary tumor nodules. DIM treatment significantly reduced the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and increased TIMP-2 levels in the sera and lungs of mice injected with 4T1 cells. Additionally, DIM treatment reduced the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. We have demonstrated that DIM profoundly inhibits the lung metastasis of 4T1 cells, which was accompanied by reduced levels of MMP, adhesion molecules, and proinflammatory cytokines. These results indicate that DIM has potential as an antimetastatic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>The utility of comparative genetics to inform breast cancer prevention strategies.

My research seeks to aid in developing approaches to prevent breast cancer. This research evolved from our early empirical studies for discovering natural compounds with anticancer activities, coupled with clinical evaluation to a genetics-driven approach to prevention. This centers on the use of comparative genomics to discover risk-modifying alleles that could help define population and individual risk and also serve as potential prevention drugable targets to mitigate risk. Here, we initially fine map mammary cancer loci in a rat carcinogenesis model and then evaluate their human homologs in breast cancer case-control association studies. This approach has yielded promising results, including the finding that the compound rat QTL Mcs5a's human homologous region was associated with breast cancer risk. These and related findings have the potential to yield advancements both in translation-prevention research and in basic molecular genetics.</docText>

        <docText>Automated cellular imaging system III for assessing HER2 status in breast cancer specimens: development of a standardized scoring method that correlates with FISH.

The goal of this study was to assess the performance characteristics of the Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS III) for HER2 immunohistochemical analysis. The study was performed on 187 biopsy slides from patients who underwent HER2 testing between January and February 2008. Three scoring methods by the ACIS III were compared with the manual score and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results for HER2 amplification. The equal distribution score (EQD) method, in which 2 areas each of high-, moderate-, and low-intensity staining were measured, most closely matched the FISH HER2 amplification result. The numbers of immunohistochemically negative (0 or 1+)/FISH+ cases were equivalent for all methods. The EQD method had significantly fewer 2+ cases (n = 16) (P &lt; .001) vs the manual method (n = 35) and yielded a higher positive predictive value (38%) for HER2 amplification compared with the manual method (20%). The EQD method may more accurately identify FISH-amplified HER2 cases with fewer 2+ cases that would be "reflexed" to FISH compared with the manual method.</docText>

        <docText>Justification of the change from 10% to 30% for the immunohistochemical HER2 Scoring criterion in breast cancer.

We compared the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) immunohistochemical scoring criterion (30%) for determining HER2 status and the Food and Drug Administration criterion (10%) with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the HER2 gene amplification method in 328 cases of breast cancer. Of 294 tumor samples successfully analyzed simultaneously by FISH and immunohistochemically, 178 of 196 cases scored 3+ using the 10% and the 30% criteria. Using FISH as the reference, the number of false-positives was reduced from 24 to 9 after application of the 30% criterion. The specificity of immunohistochemical analysis was higher with the 30% (92.0%) vs the 10% (78.8%) criterion. The kappa coefficient between FISH and immunohistochemical analysis was increased to 0.850 (almost perfect agreement; P &lt; .001) after application of the 30% criterion vs 0.757 (substantial agreement) for the 10% criterion; the false-positive rate decreased to 5.1% from 12.2%. The chi(2) test showed that immunohistochemical analysis had significantly higher accuracy with the 30% (94.9%) vs the 10% (87.8%; P = .014) criterion. Our results from a large series of Chinese patients with breast cancer support that the ASCO/CAP 30% criterion may offer better results for assessing HER2 status.</docText>

        <docText>Comparison of breast cancer survival in two populations: Ardabil, Iran and British Columbia, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Patterns in survival can provide information about the burden and severity of cancer, help uncover gaps in systemic policy and program delivery, and support the planning of enhanced cancer control systems. The aim of this paper is to describe the one-year survival rates for breast cancer in two populations using population-based cancer registries: Ardabil, Iran, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: All newly diagnosed cases of female breast cancer were identified in the Ardabil cancer registry from 2003 to 2005 and the BC cancer registry for 2003. The International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICDO) was used for coding cancer morphology and topography. Survival time was determined from cancer diagnosis to death. Age-specific one-year survival rates, relative survival rates and weighted standard errors were calculated using life-tables for each country. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients in BC had greater one-year survival rates than patients in Ardabil overall and for each age group under 60. CONCLUSION: These findings support the need for breast cancer screening programs (including regular clinical breast examinations and mammography), public education and awareness regarding early detection of breast cancer, and education of health care providers.</docText>

        <docText>Anti-proliferative action of vitamin D in MCF7 is still active after siRNA-VDR knock-down.

BACKGROUND: The active form of Vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), has strong anti-proliferative effects, yet the molecular mechanisms underneath this effect remain unclear. In contrast, the molecular mechanism of 1,25D for the regulation of calcium homeostasis has principally been resolved, demonstrating a pivotal role for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). RESULTS: We first addressed the question whether the anti-proliferative effects of 1,25D are influenced by VDR. Knockdown of VDR by siRNA did not affect the anti-proliferative effects of 1,25D in MCF7 breast cancer cells. This unanticipated finding led us to take an alternative approach using genome wide screens to study the molecular mechanisms of 1,25D in proliferation. For that purpose, four independently developed and stable 1,25D resistant MCF7 cell lines were analyzed. Array CGH identified a copy number alteration in a region of 13.5 Mb at chromosome 11q13.4-14.1 common to all four 1,25D resistant cell lines. Expression arrays revealed that no single gene was differentially expressed between the sensitive and resistant cells, but multiple membrane receptor signaling pathways were altered in the 1,25D resistant cell lines. Importantly, in the genome wide experiments neither VDR, CYP24A1 nor other known vitamin D signaling pathway genes were associated with 1,25D resistance. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, siRNA and genome wide studies both suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of 1,25D in MCF7 breast tumor cell lines do not rely on classical Vitamin D pathway per se.</docText>

        <docTitle>The contribution of founder mutations to early-onset breast cancer in French-Canadian women.</docTitle>
        <docText>The contribution of founder mutations to early-onset breast cancer in French-Canadian women.

In an ethnically-homogeneous population, it is valuable to identify founder mutations in cancer-predisposing genes. Founder mutations have been found in four breast-cancer-predisposing genes in French-Canadian breast cancer families. The frequencies of the mutant alleles have been measured neither in a large series of unselected breast cancer patients from Quebec, nor in healthy controls. These estimates are necessary to measure their contribution to the hereditary burden of breast cancer in Quebec and to help develop genetic screening policies which are appropriate for the province. We studied 564 French-Canadian women with early-onset invasive breast cancer who were treated at a single Montreal hospital. Patients had been diagnosed at age 50 or less, and were ascertained between 2004 and 2008. We screened all 564 patients for nine founder mutations: four in BRCA1, three in BRCA2 and one each in PALB2 and CHEK2. We also studied 6433 DNA samples from newborn infants from the Quebec City area to estimate the frequency of the nine variant alleles in the French-Canadian population. We identified a mutation in 36 of the 564 breast cancer cases (6.4%) and in 35 of 6443 controls (0.5%). In the breast cancer patients, the majority of mutations were in BRCA2 (54%). However, in the general population (newborn infants), the majority of mutations were in CHEK2 (54%). The odds ratio for breast cancer to age 50, given a BRCA1 mutation, was 10.1 (95% CI: 3.7-28) and given a BRCA2 mutation was 29.5 (95% CI: 12.9-67). The odds ratio for breast cancer to age 50, given a CHEK2 mutation, was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.4-9.1). One-half of the women with a mutation had a first- or second-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. Thus, it can be concluded that a predisposing mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 or PALB2 is present in approximately 6% of French-Canadian women with early-onset breast cancer. It is reasonable to offer screening for founder mutations to all French-Canadian women with breast cancer before age 50. The frequency of these mutations in the general population (0.5%) is too low to advocate population-based screening.</docText>

        <docTitle>Lung cancer: a biologically different disease in women?</docTitle>
        <docText>Lung cancer: a biologically different disease in women?

Lung cancer is now the leading cancer killer of women, having surpassed breast cancer in 1987. Over 30,000 more US women are expected to die from lung cancer than from breast cancer annually. The vast majority of lung cancer cases are attributable to smoking, and smoking prevalence rates remain unacceptably high in US women. Mounting evidence suggests that there are significant differences in lung cancer between the sexes. Although the magnitude of the effect of smoking on the development of lung cancer may not be different, smoking appears to have an impact on the histology of lung cancer. Hormonal and biologic effects may play a role in lung cancer carcinogenesis, and may impact treatment response. A more thorough understanding of the biologically different aspects of lung cancer across different populations may lead to innovations in prevention and treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Lapatinib in metastatic breast cancer.

Lapatinib is an oral, small-molecule, dual kinase inhibitor that targets both HER2 and the EGF receptor. Lapatinib was approved in June 2008 in Europe for the treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Promising results in trastuzumab-refractory metastatic breast cancer were obtained from Phase I, II and III studies in combination with chemotherapy. Diarrhea and rash are the most common side-effects and are mostly moderate and treatable. Cardiac toxicity occurs rarely and mostly as an asymptomatic and reversible decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction. Unlike trastuzumab, some data show that lapatinib could cross the blood-brain barrier, with some evidence of activity in treating or preventing brain metastases. Its evaluation is actively ongoing, in combination with trastuzumab and in the adjuvant setting.</docText>

        <docText>Germline mutation screening of the Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes TWIST1 and FGFR3 in families with BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common craniosynostosis syndromes. It is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder with variable expression that is caused by germline mutations in the TWIST1 gene or more rarely in the FGFR2 or FGFR3 genes. We have previously reported that patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Here we have analysed a cohort of 26 women with BRCA1/2-negative hereditary breast cancer to study whether a proportion of these families might have mutations in Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes. DNA sequence analysis of TWIST1 showed no pathogenic mutations in the coding sequence in any of the 26 patients. MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification)-analysis also showed no alterations in copy numbers in any of the craniofacial disorder genes MSX2, ALX4, RUNX2, EFNB1, TWIST1, FGFR1, FGFR2,FGFR3, or FGFR4. Taken together, our findings indicate that mutations in Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes are uncommon or absent in BRCA1/2-negative patients with hereditary breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Magnetic resonance imaging of breast cancer and correlation with prognostic factors.</docTitle>
        <docText>Magnetic resonance imaging of breast cancer and correlation with prognostic factors.

BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors of breast cancer have been used for the prediction of clinical outcome or selection of patients for complementary treatment. Some of the imaging features of breast cancer, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are associated with these prognostic factors. PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between dynamic enhanced MR features and prognostic factors of clinical outcome of breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients with 151 breast cancers underwent 1.5T dynamic MR imaging with the use of a dynamic T1-weighted three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (FLASH) subtraction imaging technique. Morphological and kinetic analyses of MR features were evaluated using the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) MRI lexicon. Pathological prognostic factors were correlated with MR imaging characteristics, including tumor size, histological grade, lymph node status, expression of estrogen receptor (ER), expression of progesterone receptor (PR), expression of c-erbB2, determination of Ki-67 index, and microvascular density (MVD), using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. RESULTS: Based on univariate and multivariate analyses, spiculated tumor margins correlated significantly with lower histological grade (I-II) and positive PR expression. Rim enhancement was significantly correlated with high histological grade, presence of axillary lymph node metastasis, large tumor size, increased Ki-67 index, and increased MVD. Early peak enhancement, as seen on the first scan after contrast medium injection, was correlated with negative ER expression. CONCLUSION: The presence of a lesion with a spiculated margin may predict a relatively good prognosis, and the presence of a lesion with rim enhancement may predict a relatively poor prognosis.</docText>

        <docText>Multiple (18)F-FDG, PET-CT for postoperative monitoring of breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) may be useful in the post-treatment follow-up of breast cancer patients. PURPOSE: To assess the usefulness of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT (PET-CT) for postoperative monitoring of breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine PET-CT studies performed on 55 female postoperative breast cancer patients (median age 56 years, range 36-86 years) were analyzed. The median interval between the PET-CT studies was 6 months (range 1-15 months). In order to determine the usefulness of serial PET-CT examinations in the postoperative follow-up of breast cancer patients, the PET-CT findings were compared with the physical findings, findings obtained by other imaging modalities, and the (18)F-FDG-PET (PET) findings. RESULTS: The PET findings were negative in 4 metastatic bone lesions with a positive bone scan. The PET findings were also negative in 6 of 9 osteogenic bone metastases and one of 64 osteolytic bone lesions. There were 5 cases with false-positive of PET, which were determined to be areas of soft-tissue hyperactivity. All false-positive/-negative findings were corrected by the addition of CT. CONCLUSION: The results of this study lend support to the clinical role of PET-CT in the postoperative follow-up/monitoring of breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Sonographic changes after removing all benign breast masses with sonographically guided vacuum-assisted biopsy.

BACKGROUND: Total removal of benign breast masses by vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) is now increasingly accepted as a treatment option. However, little is known about whether this procedure produces early changes on follow-up sonography and, if so, how often and what factors might influence them. PURPOSE: To evaluate sonographic changes after total removal of benign breast masses using sonographically guided VAB and to determine the influencing factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated sonographic changes prospectively 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months after biopsying 32 benign masses from which all sonographic evidence had been removed during sonographically guided directional VAB performed with 8- or 11-gauge needles. Procedural factors were documented and compared with sonographic findings. RESULTS: At 1-week follow-up, hematomas were observed in 84% (27/32) of the lesions. After 1 month, while the hematomas had resolved in all but five lesions, focal new architectural distortion had developed in 26 (90%) lesions; 11 lesions were graded as severe, mimicking malignancy. After 6 months, 23 lesions with various degrees of architectural distortion were observed. Six of the 32 lesions (19%) contained a residual lesion. No statistically significant association between sonographic findings and procedural variables was identified, except between the degree of hematoma and lesion size. CONCLUSION: The total removal of benign breast masses using sonographically guided VAB frequently produces changes on follow-up sonography after 6 months. Although these changes failed to show statistical significance with procedural factors, a larger dedicated study is needed.</docText>

        <docText>Possible Risk Modification by Polymorphisms of Estrogen Metabolizing Genes in Familial Breast Cancer Susceptibility in an Indian Population.

ABSTRACT This case control study investigated whether polymorphisms of estrogen metabolizing genes CYP1A1 MspI, CYP17 MspAI, COMT Val(158) Met, and SULT1A1 Arg(213) His have any role in familial breast cancer susceptibility risk. Logistic regression analysis adjusted to age was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Familial breast cancer risk due to CYP1A1 wt/m1 and m1/m1 genotypes was 2.3 (1.51-3.61)-fold and 7.1 (3.69-13.7)-fold, respectively. In addition to the main effects, certain first-order interactions were also significantly associated with familial breast cancer. Our results favor a possible risk modification by estrogen metabolizing gene polymorphisms in familial breast cancer susceptibility.</docText>

        <docText>The expression of p53, bcl-2, bax, fas and fasL in the primary tumour and lymph node metastases of breast cancer.

PURPOSE. It is unknown to what extent lymph node metastases differ from primary tumours of breast cancer. Our aim was to investigate the similarity between primary breast tumours and the matching lymph node metastases in 59 breast cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Immunohistochemical stainings of p53, bax, bc-l2, fas and fasL were performed in primary tumours and the parallel lymph node metastases. RESULTS. When using a cut point of 10%, the concordance between primary tumours and parallel lymph node metastases in the expression of p53 was 85%, bcl-2 79%, bax 69%, fas 59% and fasL 43%. In most tumours the staining status of p53, bcl-2 and bax in the primary tumour and the corresponding lymph node did not change more than 20%. However, these variables could fluctuate in both directions. In 15-25% of the cases, nodal expression was more than 20% lower than in the primary tumours, while in 10-17% of the cases, nodal expression was more than 20% higher than in the primary tumours. In half of the tumours, fas status did not change. Most fasL positive tumours lost positivity in the lymph node metastases or showed positively staining cancer cells only in the peripheral region of the node. A phenotype analysis of combined information of tumour fas/tumour fasL/nodal fas/nodal fasL expression (+/ - ) was assessed. The most frequently observed phenotype was tumour fas - /tumour fasL + /nodal fas - /nodal fasL- (22% of the tumours), although almost all combinations were seen. CONCLUSIONS. The expression of p53, bax, bcl - 2, fas and fasL is not maintained in the matching lymph node metastases of breast cancer. Large studies comparing the expression of relevant tumour biology factors in primary tumours and parallel lymph node metastases and their impact on therapy outcome, especially in the adjuvant setting, are warranted.</docText>

        <docText>Prevalence of depression and its related factors among Chinese women with breast cancer.

BACKGROUND. Little information is available regarding depression among Asian breast cancer survivors. METHODS. We estimated the prevalence of depression and its correlates among 1400 participants of a population-based cohort study of women with stage 0-IV breast cancer in Shanghai, China. Through in-person interviews conducted at 6 months and 18 months post-diagnosis and review of medical charts, information on sociodemographic and clinical factors and quality of life (QOL) was collected. Depression was measured by the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at 18 months post-diagnosis. RESULTS. Approximately 26% of participants had mild to severe depression and 13% fulfilled the criteria of clinical depression at 18 months post-diagnosis. Women with lower income were more likely to have depression than women with higher income (prevalence: 16.6% vs. 6.9% for mild depression and 17.1% vs. 5.5% for clinical depression, respectively). Depression was more common among women who were widowed (18.9%) or divorced/separated/single (16.4%) than among women who were married (11.8%). Women with comorbidity were more likely to have clinical depression (17.3% vs 11.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that low income, marital status, comorbidity, and low QOL scores were independent predictors for depression. We did not find that prevalence of depression differed by menopausal status, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, disease stage, or cancer-related treatments. CONCLUSION. Depression is common among Asian women with breast cancer. Routine screening and prevention of depression are warranted among women with breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>An exploratory study of associations between illness perceptions and adjustment and changes after psychosocial rehabilitation in survivors of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND. Although psychosocial interventions have been found to be beneficial for cancer patients, the role of the patients' perceptions of illness in these interventions remains unclear. We examined illness perceptions and psychological adjustment (distress and QoL) among women who had survived breast cancer and attended a psychosocial rehabilitation course. MATERIAL AND METHODS. From an ongoing longitudinal study, we used data from two sub-studies with a total of 177 survivors (145 from the descriptive study and 32 from the randomised trial). The survivors from the descriptive study and the half of the randomised survivors attended a 1-week rehabilitation course, whereas the other half of the randomised survivors only received standard care (no intervention). All survivors filled out a questionnaire 2.5 weeks before and one and six months after the course. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. No differences in the change of illness perceptions and the level of psychological adjustment were observed between the three groups of survivors between baseline and one and six months of follow-up. Baseline analyses showed that illness perceptions were associated with distress and QoL. This study indicates that illness perceptions are associated with adjustment; however, illness perceptions did not change after participation in a one-week multi-component rehabilitation course.</docText>

        <docTitle>Changes in arm morbidities and health-related quality of life after breast cancer surgery - a five-year follow-up study.</docTitle>
        <docText>Changes in arm morbidities and health-related quality of life after breast cancer surgery - a five-year follow-up study.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Many breast cancer survivors (BCS) suffer from long-term upper limb morbidities after axillary node dissection. The purpose of this five-year follow-up study was to describe changes in long-term upper limb morbidities, physical activity level, and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and to find factors that predict HRQoL five years after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS. This study included 204 women aged 55+/-10 years who had primary breast cancer surgery with axillary node dissection. The subjects were examined for arm volumes and arm lymphedema, arm pain, sensation of heaviness, shoulder function, physical activity level, and HRQoL, prior to surgery, and six months and five years after surgery. The statistical analyses used included ANOVA for repeated measures and multivariate linear regression. RESULTS. ALE (13%), pain (36%), and sensation of heaviness (21%) in the upper limbs were present five years after surgery. ALE was the only morbidity that continued to increase over time. Several dimensions of HRQoL temporarily declined after surgery, but significantly improved in the period from six months to five years after surgery. The significant predictive factors of HRQoL five years after surgery included HRQoL prior to surgery, physical activity level at leisure time (both prior to and at six months after surgery), and duration of sick leave after surgery (in weeks). CONCLUSIONS. The overall HRQoL improved significantly from baseline to five years, despite the chronic arm pain and increase in ALE. Three independent predictive factors of HRQoL were identified.</docText>

        <docText>Physical activity for the affected limb and arm lymphedema after breast cancer surgery. A prospective, randomized controlled trial with two years follow-up.

BACKGROUND. The influence of physical activity on the development of arm lymphedema (ALE) after breast cancer surgery with axillary node dissection has been debated. We evaluated the development of ALE in two different rehabilitation programs: a no activity restrictions (NAR) in daily living combined with a moderate resistance exercise program and an activity restrictions (AR) program combined with a usual care program. The risk factors associated with the development of ALE 2 years after surgery were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Women (n = 204) with a mean age of 55+/-10 years who had axillary node dissection were randomized into two different rehabilitation programs that lasted for 6 months: NAR (n = 104) or AR (n = 100). The primary outcomes were the difference in arm volume between the affected and control arms (Voldiff, in ml) and the development of ALE. Baseline (before surgery) and follow-up tests were performed 3 months, 6 months, and 2 years after surgery. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA and regression analysis. RESULTS. Voldiff did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. Arm volume increased significantly over time in both the affected and the control arms. The development of ALE from baseline to 2 years increased significantly in both groups (p &lt; 0.001). The only risk factor for ALE was BMI &gt; 25 kg/m(2). CONCLUSION. Patients that undergo breast cancer surgery with axillary lymph node dissection should be encouraged to maintain physical activity in their daily lives without restrictions and without fear of developing ALE.</docText>

        <docText>Additive endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer - back to the future.

While novel endocrine treatment options have been implemented in the advanced - as well as adjuvant setting, recent results suggest a place for "old-fashioned" additive treatment with estrogens in advanced breast cancer. This paper reviews the biological rationale for endocrine therapy in general and additive treatment with estrogens in particular. The finding that patients becoming resistant to treatment with aromatase inhibitors may subsequently respond to estrogen therapy adds important information to our understanding of therapy resistance in general. Moreover, the return of a therapeutic option abandoned more than 20 years ago, now to be used in a different sequential setting, suggests a critical examination whether there may be other conventional treatment options still earning a place as treatment in advanced disease as well. While ablative therapies including surgical oophorectomy, hypophysectomy and adrenalectomy are not candidate treatment options due to morbidity, there are additive treatment options apart from estrogen therapy that may be considered. Androgens administered at therapeutic doses are not feasible for toxicity reasons; yet, the potential of adding androgens in small doses as adjuvant to aromatase inhibitors should be further explored. Whether patients become resistant to other treatment options may still benefit from megestrol acetate, remains to be explored.</docText>

        <docText>Distinct Pose of Discodermolide in Taxol Binding Pocket Drives a Complementary Mode of Microtubule Stabilization.

The microtubule cytoskeleton has proven to be an effective target for cancer therapeutics. One class of drugs, known as microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs), binds to microtubule polymers and stabilizes them against depolymerization. The prototype of this group of drugs, Taxol, is an effective chemotherapeutic agent used extensively in the treatment of human ovarian, breast, and lung carcinomas. Although electron crystallography and photoaffinity labeling experiments determined that the binding site for Taxol is in a hydrophobic pocket in beta-tubulin, little was known about the effects of this drug on the conformation of the entire microtubule. A recent study from our laboratory utilizing hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) in concert with various mass spectrometry (MS) techniques has provided new information on the structure of microtubules upon Taxol binding. In the current study we apply this technique to determine the binding mode and the conformational effects on chicken erythrocyte tubulin (CET) of another MSA, discodermolide, whose synthetic analogues may have potential use in the clinic. We confirmed that, like Taxol, discodermolide binds to the taxane binding pocket in beta-tubulin. However, as opposed to Taxol, which has major interactions with the M-loop, discodermolide orients itself away from this loop and toward the N-terminal H1-S2 loop. Additionally, discodermolide stabilizes microtubules mainly via its effects on interdimer contacts, specifically on the alpha-tubulin side, and to a lesser extent on interprotofilament contacts between adjacent beta-tubulin subunits. Also, our results indicate complementary stabilizing effects of Taxol and discodermolide on the microtubules, which may explain the synergy observed between the two drugs in vivo.</docText>

        <docText>TSPO targeted dendrimer imaging agent: synthesis, characterization, and cellular internalization.

While it has become common practice for dendrimers to deliver imaging and therapeutic agents, there are few reported examples of cellular internalization of dendrimers. Moreover, targeting of dendrimers to the mitochondria in cells has not yet been reported. Previously, we have delivered small molecule imaging agents into glioma and breast cancer cells by targeting the translocator protein (TSPO; formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor or PBR) with a family of high-affinity conjugable ligands. The 18 kDa multimeric TSPO is expressed in steroid-producing cells, primarily on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein is a prime candidate for molecular targeting because tumors and other disease-related cells contain high densities of TSPO. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and cellular internalization into C6 rat glioma cells of a TSPO targeted dendrimer imaging agent.</docText>

        <docText>Screening the differential expression of adriamycin-resistance related genes of breast cancer by cDNA microarray

OBJECTIVE :To study the differential gene expression of adriamycin-resistance of breast cancer cell line MCF-7/ADR as compared with its parent cell MCF-7 and screen the related genes. METHODS: The in vitro inhibitory rate of MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cell lines to ADM (adriamycin) was examined by MIT assay. Then a cDNA microamay representing 14,755 genes was used to analyze the expression profiles of these two breast cancer cell lines. RESULTS :The inhibitory rate of MCF-7/ ADR to ADM was lower than that of MCF-7(P &lt;0.05)and the drug resistance to ADR of MCF-7/ADR was stronger than that of MCF-7. There were 2374 differential expression genes in MCF-7/adr and MCF-7 cell lines, of which 1099 genes upregulated with 99 genes 10-fold upregulated and 1275 genes downregulated with 71 genes 10-fold downregulated. The important upregulated genes were Bcl-2, GSTP1, c-myc, MMP-1 and NNMT while those downregulated ones p53, p21, p27 and CYPIA1. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance of breast cancer is a complicated process involving the expresison of many upregulated or downregulated genes. The application of gene chip in screening drug-resistant genes may be a new approach for selecting the optimal chemotherapeutic regimens. [Key words]</docText>

        <docText>The relationship between multi-drug resistance and proportion of leukemia stem cells and expression of drug transporters in drug-resistant leukemia K562/ADM cells

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug resistance, proportion of leukemia stem cells (LSC) and expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant leukemia cell population. METHODS: The multidrug-resistant leukemia K562/ADM cell and its parental K562 cell were used as the model cells. The drug sensitivity was tested with a MTT assay. Flow cytometry was employed to detect the immunophenotype of stem cells and the expression of P-gp and BCRP. The self-renewal and proliferating potential were examined with methylcellulose colony-forming unit assay. RESULTS: K562/ADM cells were highly resistant to adriamycin, daunorubincin and etoposide. The amount of CD34+, CD123+ and CD34+ CD38- cells in K562/ADM cells was much higher than that in K562 cells, and the proportion of CD34+ CD38- CD123+ cells (LSC) in K562/ADM cells was (5.23 +/- 0.21)% versus (1.27 + 0.17)% in K562 cells, which was 4.12-fold higher than that in K562 cells. Both P-gp and BCRP were overexpressed in K562/ADM cells relative to K562 cells, and the K562/ADM cells coexpressing P-gp and BCRP were 11.25-fold higher over K562 cells. The proportion of CD34+ CD38- CD123+ BCRP+ and CD34+ CD38- P-gp+ BCRP+ cells in K562/ADM cells were (4.13 +/- 0.40)% and (5.80 +/- 1.19)% respectively, which were 3.66- and 11.37-fold higher than the same cells in K562 cells [(1.13 +/- 0.15)% and (0.51 +/- 0.01)%]. Furthermore, drug-resistant K562/ADM cells displayed 4.17-time greater colony-forming ability over the parent K562 cells, corresponding to the proportion of LSCs in K562/ADM cells. CONCLUSIONS: The ABC transporters-overexpressing LSC population exists in drug-resistant leukemic K562/ADM cells relative to drug-sensitive K562 cells, and the drug-resistant LSCs may be the source of chemotherapeutic resistance of leukemia.</docText>

        <docText>Position of the American Dietetic Association: promoting and supporting breastfeeding.

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that exclusive breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and health protection for the first 6 months of life and breastfeeding with complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age is the ideal feeding pattern for infants. Breastfeeding is an important public health strategy for improving infant and child morbidity and mortality, improving maternal morbidity, and helping to control health care costs. Breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of otitis media, gastroenteritis, respiratory illness,sudden infant death syndrome,necrotizing enterocolitis, obesity, and hypertension. Breastfeeding is also associated with improved maternal outcomes, including a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and postpartum depression.These reductions in acute and chronic illness help to decrease health care-related expenses and productive time lost from work. Overall breastfeeding rates are increasing, yet disparities persist based on socioeconomic status, maternal age, country of origin,and geographic location. Factors such as hospital practices, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of mothers and their families, and access to breastfeeding support can influence initiation, duration, and exclusivity of breastfeeding. As experts in food and nutrition throughout the life cycle, it is the responsibility of registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, to promote and support breastfeeding for its short-term and long-term health benefits for both mothers and infants.</docText>

        <docText>The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: an examination of the factor structure and invariance among breast cancer survivors.

Objective: The present study tested the proposed five-factor structure and invariance of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996) in a sample of physically active breast cancer survivors. Methods: A sample of breast cancer survivors (N=470, Mage=57.3, SD=7.8 years) completed the PTGI and a demographic questionnaire. The factor structure, factorial invariance, and latent mean invariance were tested using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling. Results: Preliminary analyses showed acceptable reliability for the PTGI subscales (alpha&lt;0.83). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the five related factors corresponding to: relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life (chi(2) (179)=822.53, CFI=0.97, NNFI=0.96, SRMR=0.05, RMSEA=0.09). Multigroup CFA supported the invariance of the PTGI across age groups, treatment type, time since diagnosis, and time since last treatment. Conclusions: These findings provide support for (1) the multidimensional nature and factorial validity of the PTGI, and (2) the use of the PTGI in future research examining posttraumatic growth within samples of physically active breast cancer survivors.

        <docText>The role of appearance investment in the adjustment of women with breast cancer.

Objective: Appearance investment can be considered an important factor in the explanation of individual differences in adjustment to breast cancer. This study aims to analyze the role of this variable on a set of adjustment outcomes, namely, quality of life (QOL), emotional adjustment (depression and anxiety) and fear of negative evaluations. The differential role of motivational salience facet of appearance investment (MS; the individual's efforts to be or feel attractive), conceptualized as a protective factor, and of self-evaluative salience facet (SES; the importance an individual places on physical appearance for their definition of self-worth), conceptualized as a vulnerability factor, is explored.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 117 Portuguese breast cancer patients (mean age=52.47; SD=8.81), on average 2.32 months (SD=2.17) post-diagnosis. Appearance investment was measured by the ASI-R; QOL by the WHOQOL-bref; emotional adjustment by the HADS; and fear of negative evaluations by the FNE (Portuguese versions). Several hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted for each outcome, using investment facets as a predictor variable.Results: Both facets of investment contributed to the explanation of social (p&lt;/=0.001) and psychological (p&lt;/=0.001) QOL and also depression (p&lt;/=0.001), with SES being associated with poorer results and MS with better outcomes. SES also predicted higher levels of fear of negative evaluations (p&lt;/=0.001).Conclusions: This study provided significant information about the role of appearance investment in the adjustment of breast cancer patients and added empirical support to SES-MS distinction.

        <docText>Determinants of overall quality of life in women over the first year after surgery for early stage breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Scores on quality of life (QOL) domains and facets are probably subject to fluctuations across time due to the course of breast cancer treatment. Existing QOL studies have been cross-sectional. Therefore, this prospective follow-up study examined whether QOL domains (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment) and QOL facets contributed differentially across time to overall QOL in women with early stage breast cancer. METHODS: From the 608 participating women, 225 women had early stage breast cancer. Before diagnosis and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgical treatment, women with early stage breast cancer were assessed on QOL (WHOQOL-100). RESULTS: Psychological Health and Social Relationships were the QOL domains that contributed to overall QOL most consistently at the various time points. Physical Health appeared to be a contributor at all time points except 1 month after surgery. Environment contributed to a lesser extent to overall QOL compared with Physical Health, Psychological Health, and Social Relationships. Different facets contribute to overall QOL-dependent of particular measurement points. However, the facets Positive Feelings and Personal Relationships were important factors at almost all time points of maintaining a good overall QOL. CONCLUSIONS: QOL domains and facets contributed differently to overall QOL at various time points across treatment in women with early stage breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Association of maternal and intrauterine characteristics with age at menarche in a multiethnic population in Hawaii.</docTitle>
        <docText>Association of maternal and intrauterine characteristics with age at menarche in a multiethnic population in Hawaii.

This study seeks to further elucidate the mother-daughter hormonal relationship and its effects on daughter's breast cancer risk through the association with early age at menarche. Four hundred and thirty-eight healthy girls, age 9-18 and of White, Asian, and/or Polynesian race/ethnicity, were recruited from an HMO on Oahu, Hawaii. Anthropometric measures were taken at a clinic visit, and family background questionnaires were completed. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association of maternal and intrauterine hormone-related exposures with age at menarche. Weight and gestational age at birth and maternal pregnancy-induced nausea were not associated with age at menarche. Each year older of the mother's age at menarche was associated with a 21% reduced risk of an early age at menarche for the daughter (95% CI: 0.73-0.86). This association between mother's and daughter's menarcheal age was statistically significant for girls of Asian, White, and Mixed, Asian/White race/ethnicity, but not for girls of Mixed, part-Polynesian race/ethnicity (p (interaction) = 0.01). There was a suggestion that maternal history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk of early age at menarche (HR = 2.18, 95% CI: 0.95-4.98); there was no association with second-degree family history. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal and intrauterine hormone-related exposures are associated with age at menarche.</docText>

        <docText>Encapsulated apocrine papillary carcinoma of the breast-a tumour of uncertain malignant potential: report of five cases.

Five cases of an unusual encapsulated apocrine papillary tumour are reported. All presented as cystic masses in the breast of women aged 44-84 years. Imaging studies showed a complex cyst often with one or more mural nodules. The key histological features are similar to those of classical encapsulated papillary carcinoma in that myoepithelial cells were absent within the papillary structures and at the periphery of the cyst. All were pure apocrine in type and showed variable degrees of cytological atypia and mitotic activity. All lacked evidence of malignancy in the breast tissue outside of the lesion. Sentinel lymph node biopsies performed in three of the cases were negative for metastases, and all have behaved in a benign fashion.</docText>

        <docText>Analysis of false-negative results after US-guided 14-gauge core needle breast biopsy.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the false-negative rate and to evaluate the clinical, radiologic or histologic features of false-negative results at ultrasound (US)-guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy (CNB). METHODS: A total of 3,724 masses from 3,308 women who had undergone US-guided 14-gauge CNB and who had a rebiopsy or at least 2 years' follow-up were included. The histology of CNB was correlated with the rebiopsy or long-term imaging follow-up. In cases of missed cancer, the time interval between CNB and rebiopsy, the reasons for rebiopsy, and the procedural or lesion characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Of 1,706 benign CNBs, 50 additional malignancies were found at excision (false-negative rate, 2.5% of 1,982 with a final diagnosis of malignancy). Of 50 false negatives, 41 were found immediately of which 28 had rebiopsy because of imaging-histological discordance. Regarding the frequency of malignancy according to the reasons for rebiopsy, suspicious imaging finding (24%) showed significantly higher frequency than suspicious clinical findings or request (1%). Regarding the characteristics except invasiveness, no significant differences in false-negative rates were found. CONCLUSIONS: Most false negatives were found immediately and imaging-histological discordance was the most important clue. Careful correlation of clinical, radiological and histological results as well as appropriate follow-up is essential.</docText>

        <docTitle>Radiation treatment waiting times for breast cancer patients in Manitoba, 2001 and 2005.</docTitle>
        <docText>Radiation treatment waiting times for breast cancer patients in Manitoba, 2001 and 2005.

INTRODUCTION: Our study examined the wait time from ready-to-treat to radiation therapy for cohorts of breast cancer patients requiring adjuvant radiation therapy in 2001 and in 2005 after the implementation of strategies to reduce wait times for radiation treatment. We also examined the overall time from diagnosis to radiation treatment and whether distance from the cancer treatment centre or month of referral had an effect on wait times. METHODS: This population-based retrospective study looked at representative samples of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 and 2005. Patients who required radiation treatment to the breast or chest wall were followed from first contact to the start of radiation treatment. RESULTS: Time from ready-to-treat to first radiation treatment was significantly reduced for patients in 2005 as compared with 2001, regardless of whether chemotherapy was administered before radiation treatment. Time from diagnosis to radiation treatment was not different by year for those who received radiation only. Time from diagnosis to chemotherapy was significantly longer in 2005. No effect of month of diagnosis on wait times was observed. INTERPRETATION: A significant improvement in the median wait time from ready-to-treat to first radiation treatment was noted from 2001 to 2005. This improvement may be attributable to measures taken to reduce such waits. However, we observed an increase in the median time from diagnosis to referral and from referral to consultation with medical or radiation oncology (or both), so that the overall time from diagnosis to radiation treatment was not different. Although specific intervals related to radiation treatment delivery were improved, the entire trajectory of breast cancer care experienced by patients needs to be considered.</docText>

        <docText>The role of neoadjuvant her2-targeted therapies in her2-overexpressing breast cancers.

Women receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy for primary operable or inoperable breast cancer can potentially benefit in a number of ways, but the main advantage, which has been consistently demonstrated, is improved tumour resectability. Given the improvement in outcomes with the adjuvant use of trastuzumab in patients with early-stage breast cancer positive for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), questions have been raised about the use of trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. The present paper reviews the currently available data and outlines suggestions from a panel of Canadian oncologists about the use of trastuzumab and other her2-targeted agents in the neoadjuvant setting.The panel focussed onthe use of trastuzumab and other her2-targeted agents as neoadjuvant therapy in primary operable, locally advanced, and inflammatory breast cancer; andpossible choices of chemotherapeutic regimens with trastuzumab.The suggestions described here will continue to evolve as data from current and future trials with trastuzumab and other her2-targeted agents emerge.</docText>

        <docText>Radiological staging in breast cancer: which asymptomatic patients to image and how.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 4% of patients diagnosed with early breast cancer have occult metastases at presentation. Current national and international guidelines lack consensus on whom to image and how. METHODS: We assessed practice in baseline radiological staging against local guidelines for asymptomatic newly diagnosed breast cancer patients presenting to the Cambridge Breast Unit over a 9-year period. RESULTS: A total of 2612 patients were eligible for analysis; 91.7% were appropriately investigated. However in the subset of lymph node negative stage II patients, only 269 out of 354 (76.0%) investigations were appropriate. No patients with stage 0 or I disease had metastases; only two patients (0.3%) with stage II and &lt; or =3 positive lymph nodes had metastases. Conversely, 2.2, 2.6 and 3.8% of these groups had false-positive results. The incidence of occult metastases increased by stage, being present in 6, 13.9 and 57% of patients with stage II (&gt; or =4 positive lymph nodes), III and IV disease, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results prompted us to propose new local guidelines for staging asymptomatic breast cancer patients: only clinical stage III or IV patients require baseline investigation. The high specificity and convenience of computed tomography (chest, abdomen and pelvis) led us to recommend this as the investigation of choice in breast cancer patients requiring radiological staging.</docText>

        <docTitle>Activation and clinical significance of the unfolded protein response in breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Activation and clinical significance of the unfolded protein response in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The tumour microenvironment is hypoglycaemic, hypoxic and acidotic. This activates a stress signalling pathway: the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is cytoprotective if the stressor is mild, but may initiate apoptosis if severe.Activation of the UPR in breast carcinoma is induced by microenvironmental stress such as glucose and oxygen deprivation, but may also be linked to oestrogen stimulation. It may be clinically significant as it may alter chemosensitivity to doxorubicin. METHODS: 395 human breast adenocarcinomas were immunohistochemically stained for UPR activation markers (glucose-regulated protein (GRP-78 and XBP-1). A model of UPR activation in vitro by glucose deprivation of T47D breast cancer cells was developed to determine how the UPR affects cellular sensitivity to doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. Cytotoxicity was assessed using a colorimetric cytotoxicity assay (MTT). The effect of oestrogen stimulation and tamoxifen exposure on UPR activation by T47D cells was determined by western blotting measurement of the key UPR protein, GRP-78. RESULTS: Expression of GRP78 and XBP-1 was demonstrated in 76% and 90% of the breast cancers, respectively, and correlated with oestrogen receptor positivity (P=0.045 and 0.017, respectively). In vitro UPR activation induced resistance to both doxorubicin and 5-flurouracil, (P&lt;0.05). Oestrogen stimulation induced GRP78 and XBP1 over-expression on western blotting. Tamoxifen did not block this response and may induce UPR activation in its own right. CONCLUSIONS: The UPR is activated in the majority of breast cancers and confers resistance to chemotherapy. In vitro oestrogen stimulates UPR induction. UPR activation may contribute to breast cancer chemoresistance and interact with oestrogen response elements.</docText>

        <docText>Assessment of breast cancer opportunistic screening by clinical-pathological indicators: a population-based study.

Background:Although some clinical-pathological features of breast cancers, such as the incidence of ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) and the diameter of invasive tumours, are sensitive indicators of early detection, comprehensive population-based studies of opportunistic screening are needed.Methods:Cases of DCIS or invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 1996-2007 were identified from the Ticino Cancer Registry (south of Switzerland). Time trends of age-adjusted incidence and mortality, as well as main clinical-pathological features, such as tumour diameter, AJCC stage and histological grade, were analysed.Results:A total of 3047 incident cases of female breast cancer were identified. The proportion of DCIS with respect to invasive cases increased from 5.8% in the period 1996-2001 to 6.4% in the period 2002-2007. The median tumour size of invasive cancers decreased from 20 mm in 1996-2001 to 18 mm in 2002-2007 (P&lt;0.0001). An increase in well/moderately differentiated invasive tumours, from 67% in the period 1996-2001 to 73% in 2002-2007 (P&lt;0.001), was detected and resulted in an Annual Percentage Change of incidence of 2.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.3; 4.3).Conclusion:An opportunistic screening strategy can lead to an improvement of prognostic features at diagnosis, but these features are still less favourable than those achieved by organised screening programmes.</docText>

        <docTitle>Tumour-targeted delivery of TRAIL using Salmonella typhimurium enhances breast cancer survival in mice.</docTitle>
        <docText>Tumour-targeted delivery of TRAIL using Salmonella typhimurium enhances breast cancer survival in mice.

BACKGROUND: An effective cancer therapeutic must selectively target tumours with minimal systemic toxicity. Expression of a cytotoxic protein using Salmonella typhimurium would enable spatial and temporal control of delivery because these bacteria preferentially target tumours over normal tissue. METHODS: We engineered non-pathogenic S. typhimurium to secrete murine TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) under the control of the prokaryotic radiation-inducible RecA promoter. The response of the RecA promoter to radiation was measured using fluorometry and immunoblotting. TRAIL toxicity was determined using flow cytometry and by measuring caspase-3 activation. A syngeneic murine tumour model was used to determine bacterial accumulation and the response to expressed TRAIL. RESULTS: After irradiation, engineered S. typhimurium secreted TRAIL, which caused caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and death in 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells in culture. Systemic injection of Salmonella and induction of TRAIL expression using 2 Gy gamma-irradiation caused a significant delay in mammary tumour growth and reduced the risk of death by 76% when compared with irradiated controls. Repeated dosing with TRAIL-bearing Salmonella in conjunction with radiation improved the 30-day survival from 0 to 100%. CONCLUSION: These results show the pre-clinical utility of S. typhimurium as a TRAIL expression vector that effectively reduces tumour growth and extends host survival.</docText>

        <docTitle>Activity of the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib against ovarian cancer cells.</docTitle>
        <docText>Activity of the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib against ovarian cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of dasatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor that targets multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src kinase family, EphA2, and focal adhesion kinase for the treatment of ovarian cancer. METHODS: We examined the effects of dasatinib on proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and kinase activity using a panel of 34 established human ovarian cancer cell lines. Molecular markers for response prediction were studied using gene expression profiling. Multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis was used to study the interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs. RESULTS: Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of dasatinib were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines with up to a 3 log-fold difference in the IC(50) values (IC(50) range: 0.001-11.3 micromol l(-1)). Dasatinib significantly inhibited invasion, and induced cell apoptosis, but less cell-cycle arrest. At a wide range of clinically achievable drug concentrations, additive and synergistic interactions were observed for dasatinib plus carboplatin (mean CI values, range: 0.73-1.11) or paclitaxel (mean CI values, range: 0.76-1.05). In this study, 24 out of 34 (71%) representative ovarian cancer cell lines were highly sensitive to dasatinib, compared with only 8 out of 39 (21%) representative breast cancer cell lines previously reported. Cell lines with high expression of Yes, Lyn, Eph2A, caveolin-1 and 2, moesin, annexin-1, and uPA were particularly sensitive to dasatinib. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a clear biological rationale to test dasatinib as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Survival for cancer patients in Europe.

Comparing cancer survival among the European countries is important to evaluate the performance of Health Care Systems and reduce disparities in access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. The EUROCARE project compares survival in Europe since the nineties. The EUROCARE- 4 analysed 2 690 922 adult cancer cases from 83 cancer registries in 22 European countries, diagnosed in 1995-1999, and followed to December 2003. For each cancer site, the European area weighted mean and age-standardised country-specific observed and relative survival by age and sex is computed. Within-country variation in survival is analysed for selected cancers. Survival for most solid cancers, whose prognosis depends largely on stage at diagnosis (breast, colorectal, stomach cancers, and skin melanoma), was highest in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, lower in the UK and Denmark, and lowest in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia. France, Switzerland and Italy generally had good survival, slightly below that of the Northern countries. For all cancers, five-year survival was very variable also for the different sites mix. Continuing to monitoring cancer survival in Europe is important to reduce differences in access to diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. After publication of EUROCARE results, UK and Denmark developed a National cancer plan to improve time of diagnosis and treatment.</docText>

        <docText>Longitudinal analysis of domain-level breast cancer literacy among African-American women.

Functional breast cancer literacy was assessed among African-American women and measured at the domain level over time. We used the Kin Keeper(SM) Cancer Prevention Intervention to educate 161 African-American women on three domains of breast cancer literacy: (i) cancer awareness, (ii) knowledge of breast cancer screening modalities and (iii) cancer prevention and control. A breast cancer literacy assessment was administered pre- and post-educational intervention at two time points followed by another assessment 12 months after the second intervention. Generalized estimating equations were specified to predict the probability of correctly answering questions in each domain over time. Domain-level literacy differentials exist; at baseline, women had higher test scores in the breast cancer prevention and control domain than the cancer awareness domain (odds ratio = 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.34). After Kin Keeper(SM) Cancer Prevention Intervention, African-American women consistently improved their breast cancer literacy in all domains over the five time stages (P &lt; 0.001) though at different rates for each domain. Differences in domain-level breast cancer literacy highlight the importance of assessing literacy at the domain level. Interventions to improve African-American women's breast cancer literacy should focus on knowledge of breast cancer screening modalities and cancer awareness domains.</docText>

        <docText>Moyamoya disease: case report and literature review.

Moyamoya disease is a chronic, progressive occlusion of the circle of Willis arteries that leads to the development of characteristic collateral vessels seen on imaging, particularly cerebral angiography. The disease may develop in children and adults, but the clinical features differ. Moyamoya disease occurs predominantly in Japanese individuals but has been found in all races with varying age distributions and clinical manifestations. As a result, moyamoya disease has been underrecognized as a cause of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in Western countries. At this time, there is no known cure, and existing treatment options are controversial. The authors describe the case of a 44-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension, cervical cancer, breast cancer, and stroke who was diagnosed as having moyamoya disease. A review of the literature for the various facets of this condition is also provided.</docText>

        <docText>Aromatase inhibition in male breast cancer patients: biological and clinical implications.

BACKGROUND: The role of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and their impact on estradiol (E(2)) levels remain unknown in male breast cancer (MBC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MBC patients with metastatic disease and those treated with AIs were selected from the breast cancer database of the Centre Antoine-Lacassagne (Nice, France). Sex hormone levels were retrospectively assessed on serum samples from our institutional serum bank. RESULTS: Fifteen patients entered the study. Two patients (13%) had complete response, four patients (27%) had partial response, two patients (13%) had stable disease and seven patients (47%) had progressive disease. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-8.6] and 33 months (95% CI 18.4-47.6), respectively. All assessable patients (n = 6) had E(2) levels less than the lower limit of the assay during AI treatment. Among them, three had partial response, one had stable disease and two had progressive disease. A large increase in follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and E(2) levels was observed in one responding patient at progression. CONCLUSIONS: AIs are active in MBC patients. This activity is correlated with a significant reduction in E(2) levels. Secondary resistance is in part related to a deleterious feedback loop resulting in a significant increase in substrate for aromatization.</docText>

        <docText>A novel look into estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer prevention with the natural, multifunctional signal transduction inhibitor deguelin.

This perspective on Murillo et al. (beginning on page 942 in this issue of the journal) examines the potential of the naturally derived agent deguelin to prevent mammary tumorigenesis. These investigators showed that deguelin inhibits wnt/beta-catenin signaling in breast cancer cell lines, in addition to inhibiting other previously reported signaling pathways. Our growing understanding of deguelin mechanisms could lead to important advances in the prevention of estrogen receptor-negative breast and other cancers.</docText>

        <docText>Deguelin inhibits growth of breast cancer cells by modulating the expression of key members of the Wnt signaling pathway.

An emphasis in early detection and more effective treatments has decreased the mortality rate of breast cancer. Despite this decrease, breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of death among women between 40 and 55 years of age and is the second overall cause of death among women. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from several plant species, which has been reported to have chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic effects in skin, mammary, colon, and lung cancers. The effect of deguelin on cell proliferation was evaluated using four human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, BT474, T47D, and MDA-MB-231) by cell count and MTT. Moreover, apoptosis was evaluated by acridine/ethidium staining and DNA laddering. Gene expression changes following deguelin treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed through microarray analysis. Deguelin at 1 mumol/L was found to inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines tested with a range of 37% to 87%. The highest inhibition was noted for the MDA-MB-231 cell line (MDA-MB-231&gt;BT474&gt;MCF7&gt;T47D&gt;MCF12F). An arrest at the S phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis were shown in the MDA-MB-231 cells treated with deguelin. The microarray profile indicated differential expression of two independent pathways, including clusters of apoptosis and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling genes in cells as a result of deguelin treatment. These studies support the antiproliferative effects of deguelin in human breast cancer cells and, perhaps more importantly, illustrate novel actions by deguelin in the Wnt signaling pathway.</docText>

        <docText>Heat shock protein 90 inhibitors: new mode of therapy to overcome endocrine resistance.

Aromatase inhibitors are important drugs to treat estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients. However, development of resistance to aromatase inhibitors has been observed. We examined whether the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) can inhibit the growth of aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancers and the mechanisms by which 17-DMAG affects proliferation. Aromatase inhibitor-responsive MCF-7aro and aromatase inhibitor-resistant LTEDaro breast epithelial cells were used in this study. We observed that 17-DMAG inhibited proliferation in both MCF-7aro and LTEDaro cells in a dose-dependent manner. 17-DMAG induced apoptosis and G(2) cell cycle arrest in both cell lines. Although inhibition of HSP90 decreased the levels of ERalpha, the ERalpha transcriptional activity was not affected when cells were treated with 17-DMAG together with estradiol. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies suggested that 17-DMAG inhibits cell growth via degradation of HSP90 client proteins AKT and HER2. Collectively, results from this study provide data to support that HSP90 inhibitors may be an effective therapy to treat aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancers and that improved efficacy can be achieved by combined use of a HSP90 inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor.</docText>

        <docText>DNA hypermethylation of ESR1 and PGR in breast cancer: pathologic and epidemiologic associations.

Improved understanding of the etiology of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-negative and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative breast cancers may permit improved risk prediction. In vitro studies implicate DNA hypermethylation of the ERalpha and PR promoters in the pathogenesis of ERalpha-negative and PR-negative tumors, but results are not definitive. We evaluated 200 invasive breast cancers selected from a population-based case-control study. DNA extracted from fixed tumor tissue cores was tested using MethyLight to assess DNA methylation at four CpG islands: ESR1 promoters A and B; PGR promoters A and B; and a CpG shore, ESR1 promoter C. DNA methylation results were compared with levels of ERalpha and PR, tumor characteristics, and breast cancer risk factors. We observed mild to moderate DNA methylation levels in most tumors for ESR1 promoters A and B and PGR promoter B, and a few tumors showed mild methylation in PGR promoter A. In contrast, ESR1 promoter C showed a wide range of methylation and was weakly correlated with lower expression levels of ERalpha (beta = -0.26; P &lt; 0.0001) and PR (beta = -0.25; P &lt; 0.0001). The percentage of tumors with methylated PGR promoters A and B was significantly higher for tumors with low ERalpha (A, Fisher's test P = 0.0001; B, P = 0.033) and PR levels (A, P = 0.0006; B, P = 0.001). Our data suggest that the relationships between DNA methylation of ESR1 and PGR promoters and protein expression are weak and unlikely to represent a predominant mechanism of receptor silencing. In contrast to CpG islands, ESR1 promoter C showed a wider range of methylation levels and inverse associations with ERalpha and PR expression.</docText>

        <docTitle>Variation in the FGFR2 gene and the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on invasive breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Variation in the FGFR2 gene and the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on invasive breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer concern is a major reason for the recent marked reduction in use of postmenopausal hormone therapy, although equally effective means of controlling menopausal symptoms are lacking. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene are substantially associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk and could influence hormone therapy effects. Participants and METHODS: We interrogated eight SNPs in intron 2 of the FGFR2 gene for 2,166 invasive breast cancer cases from the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial and one-to-one matched controls to confirm an association with breast cancer risk. We used case-only analyses to examine the dependence of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-alone odds ratios on SNP genotype. RESULTS: Seven FGFR2 SNPs, including six in a single linkage disequilibrium region, were found to associate strongly (P &lt; 10(-7)) with breast cancer risk. SNP rs3750817 (minor allele T with frequency 0.39) had an estimated per-minor-allele odds ratio of 0.78, and was not in such strong linkage disequilibrium with the other SNPs. The genotype of this SNP related significantly (P &lt; 0.05) to hormone therapy odds ratios. For estrogen plus progestin, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) at 0, 1, and 2 minor SNP alleles were 1.52 (1.14-2.02), 1.33 (1.01-1.75), and 0.69 (0.41-1.17), whereas the corresponding values for estrogen alone were 0.74 (0.51-1.09), 0.99 (0.68-1.44), and 0.34 (0.15-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women having TT genotype for SNP rs3750817 have a reduced breast cancer risk and seem to experience comparatively favorable effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase activity is regulated by the endocytic collagen receptor Endo180.

The molecular interactions leading to organised, controlled extracellular matrix degradation are of central importance during growth, development and tissue repair, and when deregulated contribute to disease processes including cancer cell invasion. There are two major pathways for collagen degradation: one dependent on secreted and membrane-bound collagenases, the other on receptor-mediated collagen internalisation and intracellular processing. Despite the established importance of both pathways, the functional interaction between them is largely unknown. We demonstrate here, that the collagen internalisation receptor Endo180 (also known as CD280, uPARAP, MRC2) is a novel regulator of membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) activity, MT1-MMP-dependent MMP-2 activation and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity. We show close correlation between Endo180 expression, collagen accumulation and regulation of MT1-MMP cell-surface localisation and activity. We directly demonstrate, using collagen inhibition studies and non-collagen-binding mutants of Endo180, that the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is the ability of Endo180 to bind and/or internalise collagens, rather than by acting as an interaction partner for pro-uPA and its receptor uPAR. These studies strongly support a functional interaction between two distinct collagen degradation pathways, define a novel mechanism regulating MT1-MMP activity and might have important implications for organised collagen clearance in the pericellular environment.</docText>

        <docTitle>Serum molecular signatures of weight change during early breast cancer chemotherapy.</docTitle>
        <docText>Serum molecular signatures of weight change during early breast cancer chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Weight gain in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of recurrence but its mechanisms are poorly understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To investigate this, we assessed the metabolic, cytokine, and appetite-related peptide alterations during adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and correlated these with body mass measurements. Specifically, we performed global metabolic profiling using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of sequential sera, examined ghrelin immunoreactivity, RIAs for GLP-1 and peptide YY, and electrochemiluminescent cytokine analyses (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) on sequential samples. RESULTS: In those who gained &gt;1.5 kg, several metabolite levels were positively associated with weight gain, specifically lactate, which was 63.5% greater in patients with increased body weight during chemotherapy compared with those with no weight gain (P &lt; 0.01; the prespecified primary end point). A strong correlation (r = 0.7, P &lt; 0.001) was detected between the rate of weight change and serum lactate levels, and on average, lactate levels exhibited the greatest metabolic response to chemotherapy, increasing by up to 75%. Normalized levels of peptide YY were also observed to be elevated in patients not gaining weight posttreatment (+30% compared with -7% for the weight gain group; P &lt; 10(-4)). Baseline lactate, alanine, and body fat were all prognostic for weight gain (area under the receiver operator characteristic curves, &gt;0.77; P &lt; 0.05). No associations were observed between any other parameter and weight gain, including cytokine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Metabonomics identifies excess energy expenditure pathways perturbed during chemotherapy for breast cancer, and establishes a significant association between serum lactate, body fat, and substantive weight gain during chemotherapy.</docText>

        <docTitle>Altered tissue 3'-deoxy-3'-18Ffluorothymidine pharmacokinetics in human breast cancer following capecitabine treatment detected by positron emission tomography.</docTitle>
        <docText>Altered tissue 3'-deoxy-3'-18Ffluorothymidine pharmacokinetics in human breast cancer following capecitabine treatment detected by positron emission tomography.

PURPOSE: We showed in preclinical models that thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition leads to redistribution of the nucleoside transporter, ENT1, to the cell membrane and hence increases tissue uptake of [(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT). In this study, we assessed for the first time the altered pharmacokinetics of FLT in patients following administration of capecitabine, a drug whose mode of action has been reported to include TS inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed 10 lesions from six patients with breast cancer by positron emission tomography before and after treatment with capecitabine. Although drug treatment did not alter tumor delivery pharmacokinetic variables (K1 and permeability product surface area) or blood flow, tumor FLT retention variables increased with drug treatment in all but one patient. RESULTS: The baseline average standardized uptake value at 60 minutes, rate constant for the net irreversible transfer of radiotracer from plasma to tumor (Ki), and unit impulse response function at 60 minutes were 11.11 x 10(-5) m(2)/mL, 4.38 x 10(-2) mL plasma/min/mL tissue, and 4.93 x 10(-2)/min, respectively. One hour after capecitabine administration, the standardized uptake value was 13.55 x 10(-5) m(2)/mL (P = 0.004), Ki 7.40 x 10(-2) mL plasma/min/mL tissue (P = 0.004), and impulse response function was 7.40 x 10(-2)/min (P = 0.002). FLT pharmacokinetics did not change in normal tissues, suggesting that the effect was largely restricted to tumors (P = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified FLT positron emission tomography retention parameters that could be used in future early clinical studies to measure the pharmacodynamics of TS inhibitors, as well as for identifying patients who are unlikely to benefit from TS inhibition.</docText>

        <docText>Intratumoral expression of mature human neutrophil peptide-1 mediates antitumor immunity in mice.

PURPOSE: Human neutrophil peptides (HNP1-3), small molecular antimicrobial peptides, are expressed within tumors and associated with tumor necrosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Recent investigations have suggested that HNP1-3 are likely to be involved in the host immune responses to tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used recombinant pSec-HNP1, which expresses a secretable form of HNP1, to obtain expression of HNP1 in the tumor milieu in immunocompetent mice to explore the possible roles of HNP1 in tumor immunity. The antitumor effects were investigated in established CT26 colon cancer and 4T1 breast cancer models. RESULTS: HNP1-mediated chemotactic and activating effects on immature dendritic cells were detected both in vitro and in vivo. Intratumoral expression of HNP1 resulted in not only significant tumor growth inhibition but also increased CTL infiltration within tumors. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes and a (51)Cr release assay revealed specific cellular immune responses. Furthermore, increased antibodies were also found in sera from pSec-HNP1-treated mice supporting specific humoral immune responses. Increased apoptosis and decreased angiogenesis were also shown in treated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that HNP1 can exert multiple antitumor effects through different mechanisms; more importantly, HNP1 mediates host immune responses to tumors in situ through the recruitment and subsequent activation of immature dendritic cells and thus shows promising potential in cancer therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Estrogenic promotion of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity in mammary tumor cells requires activation of ErbB3 signaling.

Increasing evidence suggests molecular interactions between erbB2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases, and estrogenic compounds and their cognate receptors. We have recently reported that downregulation of erbB3 abrogates erbB2-mediated tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that erbB3 may play a major role connecting these two sentinel pathways. Interactions were studied using mammary/breast cancer cell lines from wild-type rat c-neu gene transgenic mice and humans. Estradiol promoted cell proliferation and activated erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling exclusively in mammary and breast epithelial cell lines with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3. Estradiol action was independent of the transgene promoter (MMTV-LTR) activity, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as c-neu transgene or endogenous erbB2 gene expression. Estrogen induction of cell growth promotion, erbB2/neu activation, and downstream signaling was abrogated by blockade of estrogen receptor (ER) with the pure ER antagonist ICI 182,780 or knockdown of erbB3 expression via specific siRNA. These data suggest that activation of both ER and erbB2/erbB3 signaling is requisite for estrogen-induced mitogenesis and erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase activation.</docText>

        <docTitle>RhoC expression and head and neck cancer metastasis.</docTitle>
        <docText>RhoC expression and head and neck cancer metastasis.

RhoC protein, a known marker of metastases in aggressive breast cancers and melanoma, has also been found to be overexpressed in certain head and neck cancers, thus we investigated the correlation between RhoC expression and the metastatic behavior of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Selective inhibition of RhoC expression was achieved using lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) transduced and tracked with green fluorescent protein to achieve 70% to 80% RhoC inhibition. Fluorescence microscopy of the RhoC knockdown stable clones showed strong green fluorescence in the majority of cells, signifying a high efficiency of transduction. Importantly, quantitative real-time PCR showed no significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of other members of the Ras superfamily. Cell motility and invasion were markedly diminished in RhoC-depleted cell lines as compared with control transduced lines. H&amp;E staining of lung tissue obtained from severe combined immunodeficiency mice, which had been implanted with RhoC knockdown cells, showed a marked decrease in lung metastasis and inflammation of the blood vessels. The cultured lung tissue showed a significant decrease in cell growth in mice implanted with RhoC-depleted cell lines as compared with shRNA-scrambled sequence control lines. Microscopic studies of CD31 expression revealed substantial quantitative and qualitative differences in the primary tumor microvessel density as compared with parental and shRNA-scrambled controls. This study is the first of its kind to establish the involvement of RhoC specifically in head and neck metastasis. These findings suggest that RhoC warrants further investigation to delineate its robustness as a novel potentially therapeutic target.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cancer incidence in Israeli Jewish survivors of World War II.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cancer incidence in Israeli Jewish survivors of World War II.

BACKGROUND: Israeli Jews of European origin have high incidence rates of all cancers, and many of them were exposed to severe famine and stress during World War II. We assessed cancer incidence in Israeli Jewish survivors of World War II. METHODS: Cancer rates were compared in a cohort of 315 544 Israeli Jews who were born in Europe and immigrated to Israel before or during World War II (nonexposed group, n = 57 496) or after World War II and up to 1989 (the exposed group, ie, those potentially exposed to the Holocaust, n = 258 048). Because no individual data were available on actual Holocaust exposure, we based exposure on the immigration date for European-born Israeli Jews and decided against use of the term "Holocaust survivors," implying a known, direct individual Holocaust exposure. Cancer incidences were obtained from the Israel National Cancer Registry. Relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for all cancer sites and for specific cancer sites, stratified by sex and birth cohort, and adjusted for time period. RESULTS: The nonexposed group contributed 908 436 person-years of follow-up, with 13 237 cancer diagnoses (crude rate per 100 000 person-years = 1457.1). The exposed group contributed 4 011 264 person-years of follow-up, with 56 060 cancer diagnoses (crude rate per 100 000 person-years = 1397.6). Exposure, compared with nonexposure, was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk for all-site cancer for all birth cohorts and for both sexes. The strongest associations between exposure and all-site cancer risk were observed in the youngest birth cohort of 1940-1945 (for men, RR = 3.50, 95% CI = 2.17 to 5.65; for women, RR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.69 to 3.21). Excess risk was pronounced for breast cancer in the 1940-1945 birth cohort (RR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.46 to 4.06) and for colorectal cancer in the 1935-1939 cohort (for men, RR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.59; for women, RR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.25 to 3.00). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of all cancers, particularly breast and colorectal cancer, was higher among Israeli Jews who were potentially exposed to the Holocaust than among those who were not.</docText>

        <docTitle>Recent changes in breast cancer incidence in Spain, 1980-2004.</docTitle>
        <docText>Recent changes in breast cancer incidence in Spain, 1980-2004.

BACKGROUND: Since the 1980s, Spain experienced two decades of sharply increasing breast cancer incidence. Declines in breast cancer incidence have recently been reported in many developed countries. We examined whether a similar downturn might have taken place in Spain in recent years. METHODS: Cases of invasive female breast cancer were drawn from all population-based Spanish cancer registries that had at least 10 years of uninterrupted registration over the period 1980-2004. Overall and age-specific changes in incidence rates were evaluated using change-point Poisson models, which allow for accurate detection and estimation of trend changes. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 80,453 incident cases of invasive breast cancer were identified. Overall age- and registry-adjusted incidence rates rose by 2.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7% to 3.1%) annually during the 1980s and 1990s; there was a statistically significant change in this trend in 2001 (95% CI = 1998 to 2004; P value for the existence of a change point &lt;.001), after which incidence declined annually by 3.0% (95% CI = 1.8% to 4.1%). This trend differed by age group: There was a steady increase in incidence for women younger than 45 years, an abrupt downturn in 2001 for women aged 45-64 years, and a gradual leveling off in 1995 for women aged 65 years or older. Separate analyses for registries that had at least 15 years of uninterrupted registration detected a statistically significant interruption of the previous upward trend in breast cancer incidence in provinces that had aggressive breast cancer screening programs and high screening participation rates, including Navarra (change point = 1991, P &lt; .001), Granada (change point = 2002, P = .003), Bizkaia (change point = 1998, P &lt; .001), Gipuzkoa (change point = 1998, P = .001), and Araba (change point = 1997, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The recent downturn in breast cancer incidence among Spanish women older than 45 years is best explained by a period effect linked to screening saturation.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluation of pH-responsive liposomes containing amino acid-based zwitterionic lipids for improving intracellular drug delivery in vitro and in vivo.

We developed pH-responsive liposomes containing synthetic glutamic acid-based zwitterionic lipids and evaluated their properties both in vitro and in vivo with the aim of constructing an efficient liposome-based systemic drug delivery system. The glutamic acid-based lipids; 1,5-dihexadecyl N-glutamyl-l-glutamate (L1) and 1,5-dihexadecyl N,N-diglutamyl-lysyl-l-glutamate (L2) were synthesized as a pH-responsive component of liposomes that respond to endosomal pH. The zeta potential of liposomes containing L1 or L2 was positive when the solution pH was below 4.6 or 5.6, respectively, but negative at higher pH values. The pH-responsive liposomes showed improved fusogenic potential to an endosome-mimicking anionic membrane at acidic pH, where the zeta potential of the liposomes was positive. We then prepared doxorubicin (DOX)-encapsulating liposomes containing L1 or L2, and clarified by confocal microscopic studies that the contents were rapidly transferred into both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Release of DOX from the endosomes mediated by the pH-responsive liposomes dramatically inhibited cancer cell growth. The L2-liposomes were slightly more effective than L1-liposomes as a drug delivery system. Intravenously injected L2-liposomes displayed blood persistence comparable to that of conventional phospholipid (PC)-based liposomes. Indeed, the antitumor efficacy of L2-liposomes was higher than that of PC-based liposomes against a xenograft breast cancer tumor in vivo. Thus, the high performance of L2-liposomes results from both efficient intracellular drug delivery and comparable blood persistence in comparison with the conventional PC-based liposomes in vitro and in vivo.</docText>

        <docText>Targeting tumorigenesis: development and use of mTOR inhibitors in cancer therapy.

ABSTRACT: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase positioned at a central point in a variety of cellular signaling cascades. The established involvement of mTOR activity in the cellular processes that contribute to the development and progression of cancer has identified mTOR as a major link in tumorigenesis. Consequently, inhibitors of mTOR, including temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus (formerly deforolimus) have been developed and assessed for their safety and efficacy in patients with cancer. Temsirolimus is an intravenously administered agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Everolimus is an oral agent that has recently obtained US FDA and EMEA approval for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib. Ridaforolimus is not yet approved for any indication. The use of mTOR inhibitors, either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents, has the potential to provide anticancer activity in numerous tumor types. Cancer types in which these agents are under evaluation include neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, sarcoma, endometrial cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. The results of ongoing clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors, as single agents and in combination regimens, will better define their activity in cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Overexpression and involvement of special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 in multidrug resistance in human breast carcinoma cells.

Special AT-rich sequence binding protein (SATB) 1 has been proposed to act as a determinant for the acquisition of metastatic activity by controlling expression of a specific set of genes that promote metastatic activity. Here we found that SATB1 expression is upregulated in multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells that exhibit higher invasive potential than the parental cells. Apart from accelerating metastasis and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, SATB1 was demonstrated to confer resistance to both P-glycoprotein-related and P-glycoprotein-non-related drugs on MCF7 cells, which was accompanied by decreasing accumulation of adriamycin in SATB1-overexpressing transfectants. SATB1 depletion could partially reverse the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of MCF7/ADR in vitro and in vivo. The SATB1-induced P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR could be reversed by treatment with anti-P-glycoprotein mAb. Moreover, SATB1 plays an important role in anti-apoptotic activity in MCF7/ADR cells in response to adriamycin treatment, which suggests another mechanism contributing to SATB1-related MDR of breast cancers. These data provide new insights into the mode by which breast tumors acquire the MDR phenotype and also imply a role for SATB1 in this process. (Cancer Sci 2009).</docText>

        <docText>Soy product and isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk defined by hormone receptor status.

The association between soy food consumption and breast cancer risk has been inconsistent. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to assess the relationship between soy food intake and breast cancer risk according to the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) status of breast cancer in Chinese women residing in Guangdong province from June 2007 to August 2008. A total of 438 consecutively recruited cases with primary breast cancer were frequency matched to 438 controls by age (5-year interval) and residence (rural/urban). Dietary intake was assessed by face-to-face interviews using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained by using multiple unconditional logistic regression adjusted for the potential confounders. We observed a statistically significant inverse association between soy isoflavone and soy protein intake with breast cancer risk. The multivariate ORs (95% CIs) of breast cancer risk for the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile were 0.54 (0.34-0.84) for soy isoflavone and 0.62 (0.40-0.96) for soy protein, respectively. A preventive effect of soy food was found for all subtypes of ER and/or PR status of breast cancer. The inverse association was more evident among premenopausal women. This study suggests that consumption of soy food, soy isoflavone, is inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer. The protective effects of soy did not seem to differ by ER and PR breast cancer status. (Cancer Sci 2009).</docText>

        <docText>Serum autoantibodies as biomarkers for early cancer detection.

Autoantibodies against autologus tumor-associated antigens have been detected in the asymptomatic stage of cancer and can thus serve as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. Moreover, because autoantibodies are found in sera, they can be screened easily using a noninvasive approach. Consequently, many studies have been initiated to identify novel autoantibodies relevant to various cancer types. To facilitate autoantibody discovery, approaches that allow the simultaneous identification of multiple autoantibodies are preferred. Five such techniques - SEREX, phage display, protein microarray, SERPA and MAPPing - are discussed here. In the second part of this review, we discussed autoantibodies found in the five most common cancers (lung, breast, colorectal, stomach and liver). The discovery of panels of tumor-associated antigens and autoantibody signatures with high sensitivity and specificity would aid in the development of diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics for cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Alcohol Stimulates Activation of Snail, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Signaling, and Biomarkers of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Colon and Breast Cancer Cells.

Background: Alcohol consumption is associated with the risk of progressive cancers including colon and breast cancer. The mechanisms for the alcohol-induced aggressive behavior of these epithelial cancer cells have not been fully identified. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program recently shown to play a role in cancer progression and metastases. We hypothesized that alcohol might promote cancer progression by inducing EMT in cancer cells and tested this hypothesis by assessing alcohol-stimulated changes in phenotypic markers of EMT as well as the EMT transcription factor Snail and its related cell signaling. Methods: Colon and breast cancer cell lines and a normal intestinal epithelial cell line were tested as well as colonic mucosal biopsy samples from alcoholic subjects. Cells were treated with alcohol and assessed for EMT-related changes using immunofluorescent microscopy, western blotting, reporter assays, RT-PCR, and knockdown of Snail with siRNA. Results: We show alcohol upregulated the signature EMT phenotypic marker vimentin as well as matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 and cell migration in colon and breast cancer cells-all characteristics of EMT. Alcohol also stimulated nuclear localization of Snail phosphorylated at Ser246, transcription from a Snail reporter plasmid, and Snail mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Snail siRNA knockdown prevented alcohol-stimulated vimentin expression. In vivo, Snail expression was significantly elevated in colonic mucosal biopsies from alcoholics. Also, we found alcohol stimulated activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and an EGFR inhibitor blocked alcohol-induced cell migration and Snail mRNA expression. Conclusions: Collectively, our data support a novel mechanism for alcohol promoting cancer progression through stimulating the EMT program in cancer cells via an EGFR-Snail mediated pathway. This study reveals new pathways for alcohol-mediated promotion of cancer that could be targeted for therapy or prevention of alcohol-related cancers.</docText>

        <docTitle>Hedgehog target genes: mechanisms of carcinogenesis induced by aberrant hedgehog signaling activation.</docTitle>
        <docText>Hedgehog target genes: mechanisms of carcinogenesis induced by aberrant hedgehog signaling activation.

Hedgehog signaling is aberrantly activated in glioma, medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and other tumors. Hedgehog signals activate GLI family members via Smoothened. RTK signaling potentiates GLI activity through PI3K-AKT-mediated GSK3 inactivation or RAS-STIL1-mediated SUFU inactivation, while GPCR signaling to Gs represses GLI activity through adenylate cyclase-mediated PKA activation. GLI activators bind to GACCACCCA motif to regulate transcription of GLI1, PTCH1, PTCH2, HHIP1, MYCN, CCND1, CCND2, BCL2, CFLAR, FOXF1, FOXL1, PRDM1 (BLIMP1), JAG2, GREM1, and Follistatin. Hedgehog signals are fine-tuned based on positive feedback loop via GLI1 and negative feedback loop via PTCH1, PTCH2, and HHIP1. Excessive positive feedback or collapsed negative feedback of Hedgehog signaling due to epigenetic or genetic alterations leads to carcinogenesis. Hedgehog signals induce cellular proliferation through upregulation of N-Myc, Cyclin D/E, and FOXM1. Hedgehog signals directly upregulate JAG2, indirectly upregulate mesenchymal BMP4 via FOXF1 or FOXL1, and also upregulate WNT2B and WNT5A. Hedgehog signals induce stem cell markers BMI1, LGR5, CD44 and CD133 based on cross-talk with WNT and/or other signals. Hedgehog signals upregulate BCL2 and CFLAR to promote cellular survival, SNAI1 (Snail), SNAI2 (Slug), ZEB1, ZEB2 (SIP1), TWIST2, and FOXC2 to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and PTHLH (PTHrP) to promote osteolytic bone metastasis. KAAD-cyclopamine, Mu-SSKYQ-cyclopamine, IPI-269609, SANT1, SANT2, CUR61414 and HhAntag are small-molecule inhibitors targeted to Smoothened, GANT58, GANT61 to GLI1 and GLI2, and Robot-nikinin to SHH. Hedgehog signaling inhibitors should be used in combination with RTK inhibitors, GPCR modulators, and/or irradiation for cancer therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Tumor burden influences cytotoxic T cell development in metastatic breast cancer patients--a phase I/II study.

The influence of tumor burden on the generation of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) was investigated in a phase I/II clinical adoptive immunotherapy trial. Four previously treated metastatic breast cancer patients, two with macroscopic disease and two with no evidence of disease, in complete remission (CR), were enrolled. Each apheretic peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample was stimulated twice with MUC-1 before infusion back into the patients. CTL responses against MCF-7 cell line and cytokine production were measured before infusion. Patients received two monthly CTL infusions and were monitored for toxicity, tumor response as well as tumor marker levels. The CTL generated from patients with high tumor burdens had less cytokine production and lower cytotoxicity of MCF-7 than the CTL of patients in CR. The differences between the two groups were observed after the two MUC1 in vitro stimulations of the cells obtained in first apheresis. This difference increased after the two MUC1 stimulations of the cells obtained in the second apheresis. The cytotoxicity function was sustained from the first infusion to the second apheresis only for the patients in CR. This suggests that tumor burden had an inverse effect on the function of the generated CTL.</docText>

        <docText>Social workers as patient navigators for breast cancer survivors: what do African-American medically underserved women think of this idea?

Patient navigation (PN) is a new initiative in health care aimed at reducing disparities by assisting patients in overcoming barriers within the health care system. As PN programs grow around the country, it is important to consult the key stakeholders in the development of these programs. The purpose of this qualitative study was to discuss the needs of medically underserved cancer patients and allow them the opportunity to provide input on models of care to meet their needs. Four focus groups were conducted in three major cities across Tennessee. Research participants (n = 36) were recruited by the staff in area cancer support programs and treatment programs across the state and through recruitment flyers at various treatment centers and community organizations. Findings revealed four key themes in the development of PN programs: (1) the PN needs to address access to quality care issues; (2) the PN needs to address the emotional and practical concerns of the cancer survivor, (3) the PN needs to address family concerns; (4) the PN needs to be involved across the continuum of care from time of diagnosis into long-term survivorship. Oncology social workers have a unique opportunity to meet the needs of medically underserved cancer patients through the PN movement. Our profession is a key stakeholder in this movement. We need to advocate for trained oncology social workers to actively pursue the role of patient navigators to ensure that the needs of medically underserved cancer survivors and their families are met.</docText>

        <docText>Viable tumor tissue detection in murine metastatic breast cancer by whole-body MRI and multispectral analysis.

Whole-body MRI combined with a semiautomated hierarchical multispectral image analysis technique was evaluated as a method for detecting viable tumor tissue in a murine model of metastatic breast cancer (4T1 cell line). Whole-body apparent diffusion coefficient, T(2), and proton density maps were acquired in this study. The viable tumor tissue segmentation included three-stage k-means clustering of the parametric maps, morphologic operations, application of a size threshold, and reader discrimination of the segmented objects. The segmentation results were validated by histologic evaluation, and the detection accuracy of the technique was evaluated at three size thresholds (15, 100, and 500 voxels). The accuracy was 88.9% for a 500-voxel size threshold, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84. The regions of segmented viable tumor tissue within the primary tumors were found mostly on the periphery of the tumors in agreement with the histologic findings. The presented technique was found capable of detecting metastases and segmenting the viable tumor from necrotic regions within tumors found in this model. It offers a noninvasive, whole-body, viable tumor tissue detection method for preclinical and potentially clinical applications such as tumor screening and evaluating therapeutic efficacy.

        <docText>High-frequency mode conversion technique for stiff lesion detection with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).

A novel imaging technique is described in which the mode conversion of longitudinal waves is used for the qualitative detection of stiff lesions within soft tissue using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) methods. Due to the viscoelastic nature of tissue, high-frequency shear waves attenuate rapidly in soft tissues but much less in stiff tissues. By introducing minimally-attenuating longitudinal waves at a significantly high frequency into tissue, shear waves produced at interfaces by mode conversion will be detectable in stiff regions, but will be significantly attenuated and thus not detectable in the surrounding soft tissue. This contrast can be used to detect the presence of stiff tissue. The proposed technique is shown to readily depict hard regions (mimicking tumors) present in tissue-simulating phantoms and ex vivo breast tissue. In vivo feasibility is demonstrated on a patient with liver metastases in whom the tumors are readily distinguished. Preliminary evidence also suggests that quantitative stiffness measurements of stiff regions obtained with this technique are more accurate than those from conventional MRE because of the short shear wavelengths. This rapid, qualitative technique may lend itself to applications in which the localization of stiff, suspicious neoplasms is coupled with more sensitive techniques for thorough characterization.

        <docText>Do the dose or route of administration of norethisterone acetate as a part of hormone therapy play a role in risk of breast cancer: Nation-wide case-control study from Finland.

We examined the associations between various doses and routes of administration of norethisterone acetate (NETA) in estrogen-progestagen therapy (EPT) and the risk of breast cancer in Finland.All Finnish women with first invasive breast cancer diagnosed between the ages of 50-62 during 1995-2007 (n= 9,956) were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. For each case, three controls of the same age were retrieved from the Finnish Population Register. The use of estradiol+NETA-therapy by the cases and controls was traced from the national Medical Reimbursement Registry. The data were analysed with multivariate conditional logistic regression, adjusting for parity, age at the first birth and health care district.The continuous mode of NETA use tended to be associated with a higher rate ratio for breast cancer than the sequential use. The use of continuous "low" dose (NETA 0.5mg + estradiol 1.0mg) was associated with an increased rate ratio of breast cancer already in less than 3 years of use (odds ratio 1.94; 95% confidence interval 1.39-2.70) while a risk elevation for "high" dose (NETA 1.0 mg + estradiol 2.0 mg) was seen after 3 years use (1.71; 1.51-2.54). Oral and transdermal use of NETA were accompanied with comparable risks for breast cancer.In conclusion, the dose or route of administration of NETA in EPT do not modify the risks for breast cancer.

        <docText>Racial differences in follow-up of abnormal mammography findings among economically disadvantaged women.

BACKGROUND:: In the United States, and particularly in South Carolina, African-American women suffer disproportionately higher mortality rates from breast cancer than European-American women. The timeliness of patient adherence to the follow-up of mammographic abnormalities may influence prognosis and survival. The objective of the current investigation was to examine racial differences in the completion and completion time of a diagnostic workup after the finding of a suspicious breast abnormality. METHODS:: Study participants of the Best Chance Network, a statewide service program that provides free mammography screening to economically disadvantaged and medically underserved women, were included in the study. Racial differences in tumor characteristics and adherence to recommended workup were tested using chi-square tests and t tests. Logistic and Cox regression modeling was used to assess the relation between workup completion and other factors among African-American women and European-American women. RESULTS:: Completion of the workup was associated with the number of previous procedures and income, and no significant differences were noted by race. The amount of time to completion of the workup was influenced by previous procedures, income, and race. After accounting for completion time, African-American women were 12% less likely than European-American women to complete the recommended workup (hazard ratio, 0.88; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS:: The results from this study established a racial disparity in the time to completion of a diagnostic workup among Best Chance Network participants. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the factors associated with delays in and adherence to completing the recommended workup when breast abnormalities are detected in mammograms.

        <docText>First Epidemiological Analysis of Breast Cancer Incidence and Tumor Characteristics after Implementation of Population-Based Digital Mammography Screening.

PURPOSE: To epidemiologically evaluate the impact of digital mammography screening on incidence rates and tumor characteristics for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first German digital screening units in the clinical routine were evaluated during the implementation period by using data from the cancer registry to compare the incidence rate of breast cancers and prognostic characteristics. 74 % of women aged 50 - 69 within the region of Muenster/Coesfeld/Warendorf were invited between 10 / 2005 and 12 / 2007 for initial screening; 55 % participated (n = 35 961). RESULTS: In 2002 - 2004 the average breast cancer incidence rate (per 100 000) was 297.9. During the implementation of screening, the rate rose to 532.9 in 2007. Of the 349 cancers detected with screening, 76 % (265 / 349) were invasive compared to 90 % (546 / 608) of cases not detected with screening during the same period. 37 % (97 / 265) of cancers detected in the screening program had a diameter of &lt;/= 10 mm and 75 % (198 / 265) were node-negative compared to 15 % (79 / 546) and 64 % (322 / 503), respectively, in cancers detected outside the screening program. The distribution of invasive tumor size (pT categories) and the nodal status differed with statistical significance between cancers detected in and outside the program (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSION: Epidemiological data shows that the implementation of a population-based screening program led to a relevant increase in the age-specific breast cancer incidence rate. The characteristics of breast cancers detected in the screening program comply with the requirements of the European guidelines and are significantly favorable compared to tumors diagnosed outside the program. These findings indicate that digital mammography screening fulfills the requirements for an early tumor detection tool.</docText>

        <docText>Ethnicity and persistent symptom burden in breast cancer survivors.

INTRODUCTION: Relatively few studies of breast cancer survivors have included nonwhite women or women who do not speak English. METHODS: We administered a survey to patients who were &gt;/=3 months post-completion of their adjuvant treatment for stage 0-III breast cancer at Columbia University Medical Center in order to assess the prevalence of 16 physical and emotional symptoms and identify sociodemographic factors associated with these symptoms. Univariate analysis, factor analysis, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Of 139 patients surveyed, 58 were white, 63 Hispanic, and 18 black. The symptom most commonly reported was fatigue(76%), and the most common severe symptom was muscle aches(40%). Most patients(70%) complained of &gt;/=6 symptoms. Hispanic women were more likely to report &gt;10 symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Factor analysis reduced the 16 symptoms to 4 underlying symptom clusters that we categorized as 'depression', 'chemotherapy', 'hormone', and 'pain'-related. In the multiple linear regression models, Hispanic women were more likely to report chemotherapy-related symptoms (p &lt; 0.05) and pain-related symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Unemployed women were more likely to report chemotherapy-related symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Women &lt;45 years old were less likely to report chemotherapy (p &lt; 0.05) and pain-related symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women in this study, particularly those who were Hispanic, elderly, or unemployed, experienced persistent symptoms, most commonly fatigue and muscle aches. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Because Hispanic, elderly, or unemployed women experience greater symptom burden, efforts should made to address their unique needs.</docText>

        <docText>Analysis of breast cancer related gene expression using natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model to identify prognostic associations.

Many studies correlating gene expression data to clinical parameters assume a linear increase or decrease of the clinical parameter under investigation with the expression of a gene. We have studied genes encoding important breast cancer-related proteins using a model for survival-type data that is based on natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model, thereby removing the linearity assumption. Expression data of 16 genes were studied in relation to metastasis-free probability in a cohort of 295 consecutive breast cancer patients treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute. The independent predictive power for disease outcome of the 16 individual genes was tested in a multivariable model with known clinical and pathological risk factors. There is a linear relationship between increasing expression and a higher or lower hazard for distant metastasis for ESR1, ERBB4, VEGF, CCNE2, EZH2, and UPA; for ERBB2, ERBB3, CCND1, CCNE1, EED, CXCR4, CCR7, SDF1, and PAI1 there is no clear increase or decrease; and for EGFR there seems to be a non-linear relation. Multivariable analysis showed that the 70-gene prognosis profile outperforms all the other variables in the model (hazard-rate 5.4, 95% CI 2.5-11.7; P = 0.000018). EGFR-expression seems to have a non-linear relation with disease outcome, indicating that lower but also higher expression of EGFR are associated with worse outcome compared to intermediate expression levels; the other genes show no or a linear relation.</docText>

        <docText>No evidence for glutathione S-transferases GSTA2, GSTM2, GSTO1, GSTO2, and GSTZ1 in breast cancer risk.

Breast cancer is a complex disease and in recent years a number of breast cancer susceptibility genes have been identified, but the role of low penetrance susceptibility genes has not been completely resolved. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are phase II xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes involved in the detoxification of chemical carcinogens and environmental pollutants and play an important role in cell defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. They have been in the spot light for the investigation of a potential association with breast cancer risk but so far, sparse or even no data for a potential contribution of GSTA2, GSTM2, GSTO, and GSTZ to breast cancer risk are available. We genotyped GSTA2_448_C &gt; G (rs2180314), GSTA2_742_A &gt; C (rs6577), GSTM2_-832_T &gt; C (rs638820), GSTO1_-1242_G &gt; A (rs2164624), GSTO1_419_A &gt; C (rs4925), GSTO2_-183_A &gt; G (rs2297235), GSTO2_342_A &gt; G (rs156697), GSTZ1_-4378_A &gt; G (rs1046428), and GSTZ1_94_G &gt; A (rs3177427) by MALDI-TOF MS in the German GENICA breast cancer case-control collection of 1021 cases and 1015 controls and performed breast cancer risk association in general and with respect to the stratifications: menopausal status, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, use of oral contraceptives, use of hormone therapy, body mass index, and smoking as well as histopathological tumor characteristics including hormone receptor status, grade, histology, and node status. We did not observe any breast cancer risk associations and conclude that it is unlikely that glutathione S-transferases GSTA2, GSTM2, GSTO1, GSTO2, and GSTZ1 participate in breast cancer susceptibility.</docText>

        <docTitle>EGFR over-expression and activation in high HER2, ER negative breast cancer cell line induces trastuzumab resistance.</docTitle>
        <docText>EGFR over-expression and activation in high HER2, ER negative breast cancer cell line induces trastuzumab resistance.

HER2 is gene amplified or over-expressed in 20-25% of breast cancers resulting in elevated HER2 activation. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody, targets activated HER2 and is clinically effective in HER2-over-expressing breast cancers. However, despite prolonged survival, treated breast cancer patients develop resistance. Resistance to trastuzumab occurs upon inactivation of HER2 regulatory proteins or upon up-regulation of alternative receptors. In particular, elevated levels of EGFR, present in estrogen receptor (ER) positive, trastuzumab-resistant BT-474 xenografts caused, a trastuzumab-resistant phenotype (Ritter et al. Clin Cancer Res 13:4909-4919, 2007). However, the role of EGFR in acquired trastuzumab resistance in ER negative cell models is not well defined. In this study, SKBR3 cell line clones expressing EGFR were generated to examine the role of EGFR over-expression on trastuzumab sensitivity in an, ER-negative breast carcinoma cell line. A stable clone, SKBR3/EGFR (clone 4) expressing moderate levels of EGFR remained sensitive to trastuzumab, whereas a stable clone, SKBR3/EGFR (clone 5) expressing high levels of EGFR, became resistant to trastuzumab. Depletion of EGFR by EGFR small-interfering RNAs in the SKBR3/EGFR (clone 5) reversed trastuzumab resistance. However, the SKBR3/EGFR (clone 5) cell line remained sensitive to lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 inhibitor. Biochemical analysis using co-immunoprecipitation and proximity-based quantitative VeraTag assays demonstrated that high levels of EGFR phosphorylation, EGFR/EGFR homo-dimerization, and EGFR/HER2 hetero-dimerization were present in the trastuzumab-resistant cells. We conclude that EGFR over-expression can mediate trastuzumab resistance in both ER positive and ER negative cells and hypothesize that a threshold level of EGFR, in the absence of autocrine ligand production, is required to induce the resistant phenotype.</docText>

        <docText>Genomic screening for genes upregulated by demethylation revealed novel targets of epigenetic silencing in breast cancer.

Breast cancer arises through the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations and epigenetic changes such as methylation, which silences gene expression in a variety of cancers. In the present study, we applied genomic screening to identify genes upregulated by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in a human breast cancer cell line (MCF7). We identified 288 genes upregulated and 29 genes downregulated more than fivefold after treatment with DAC, and gene ontology analyses revealed the genes to be involved in immune responses, apoptosis, and cell differentiation. In addition, real-time PCR analysis of ten genes silenced in MCF7 cells confirmed that they are upregulated by DAC, while bisulfite-pyrosequencing analysis confirmed that nine of those genes were silenced by methylation. We also found that treating MCF7 cells with DAC restored induction of DFNA5 by p53, as well as by two other p53 family genes, p63gamma and p73beta. Introduction of NTN4 into MCF7 cells suppressed cell growth, indicating that NTN4 has tumor suppressive activity. In primary breast cancers, we detected cancer-specific methylation of NTN4, PGP9.5, and DKK3, suggesting that methylation of these genes could be useful markers for diagnosis of breast cancer. Thus, DNA methylation appears to be a common event in breast cancer, and the genes silenced by methylation could be useful targets for both diagnosis and therapy.</docText>

        <docTitle>Predictive Factors of Response to Decongestive Therapy in Patients with Breast-Cancer-Related Lymphedema.</docTitle>
        <docText>Predictive Factors of Response to Decongestive Therapy in Patients with Breast-Cancer-Related Lymphedema.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported the benefits of Decongestive treatment in patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) but few have study what are the predictive factors of response. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter controlled cohort study of 171 patients with BCRL to identify independent predictive factors of response to decongestive treatment (CDT). Demographic data and clinical and lymphedema characteristics were collected prospectively. The end point was the "percentage reduction in excess volume (PREV)." Volumes were measured prior and at the end of CDT. Factors associated with response (PREV) were tested in univariate and multivariate analyses using linear regression techniques. RESULTS: Median age was 60.4 years (range 32-84); mean lymphedema chronicity 4 years [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 3.1-5.0]; mean baseline excess volume (EV) was 936 mL (95% CI: 846-1026), and mean percentage EV was 35.3% (95% CI: 32.0-38.7); compliance to bandages was good in 81.3% of patients. PREV was 71.7% (95% CI: 65.2-78.2). After univariate screening, 11 variables were found to be associated with PREV but only 4 variables were independent predictive factors of response to CDT in the multivariate analysis: Venous insufficiency, percentage of EV (the higher the EV, the lower the reduction with CDT); compliance to bandages (a good compliance improved PREV in 25%), and treatment in autumn (better results than during the rest of the year). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that compliance to bandages during CDT is one of the most important predictors of response. Moreover, data support the idea that more severe lymphedemas have a worse response to treatment, and it should be recommended in early stages. The association between the season of treatment and response was also very strong, so weather conditions are an additional factor that must be taken into account in further studies.</docText>

        <docText>A follow-up study of mortality among women in the North American synthetic rubber industry.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mortality from cancer and other diseases among 4863 women employed at eight North American styrene-butadiene rubber plants. Cancers of the lymphohematopoietic tissues, breast, and ovary were of strongest a priori interest. METHODS: Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: The observed number of deaths was approximately equal to that expected for leukemia (10 observed/13 expected), Hodgkin lymphoma (1/1.6), multiple myeloma (7/7.9), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (15/14), and cancers of the breast (72/74) and ovary (21/22). Ever-hourly women had more than expected deaths from lung (47/30, SMR = 159, CI = 117 to 211) and bladder (6/1.8, SMR = 332, CI = 122 to 723) cancers. Exposure-response analysis, done only for lung cancer, indicated no trend for butadiene or styrene. CONCLUSIONS: The observed excesses of lung and bladder cancers may be attributable to nonoccupational factors rather than to workplace exposures.</docText>

        <docText>Frequency of Extrapancreatic Neoplasms in Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm of the Pancreas: Implications for Management.

OBJECTIVE:: To estimate the frequency of extrapancreatic neoplasms in patients with IPMN compared with those with ductal pancreatic cancer and a general referral population. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: Several studies have reported an increased risk of extrapancreatic neoplasms in patients with IPMN, but these studies focused only on those patients who underwent resection and excluded those patients treated nonoperatively. METHODS:: All patients diagnosed with IPMN at Mayo Clinic from 1994 to 2006 were identified. Two control groups consisting of Group 1-patients with a diagnosis of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma (1:1) and Group 2-a general referral population (3:1) were matched for gender and age at diagnosis, year of registration, and residence. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of a diagnosis of extrapancreatic neoplasms among cases versus controls. RESULTS:: There were 471 cases, 471 patients in Group 1, and 1413 patients in Group 2. The proportion of IPMN patients having any extrapancreatic neoplasm diagnosed before or coincident to the index date was 52% (95% CI, 47%-56%), compared with 36% (95% CI, 32%-41%) in Group 1 (P &lt; 0.001), and 43% (95% CI, 41%-46%) in Group 2 (P = 0.002). Benign neoplasms most frequent in the IPMN group were colonic polyps (n = 114) and Barrett's neoplasia (n = 18). The most common malignant neoplasms were nonmelanoma skin (n = 35), breast (n = 24), prostate (n = 24), colorectal cancers (n = 19), and carcinoid neoplasms (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS:: Patients with IPMN have increased risk of harboring extrapancreatic neoplasms. Based on the frequency of colonic polyps, screening colonoscopy should be considered in all patients with IPMN.</docText>

        <docText>p21CIP1 attenuates Ras- and c-Myc-dependent breast tumor epithelial mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell-like gene expression in vivo.

p21(CIP1/WAF1) is a downstream effector of tumor suppressors and functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor to block cellular proliferation. Breast tumors may derive from self-renewing tumor-initiating cells (BT-ICs), which contribute to tumor progression, recurrence, and therapy resistance. The role of p21(CIP1) in regulating features of tumor stem cells in vivo is unknown. Herein, deletion of p21(CIP1), which enhanced the rate of tumorigenesis induced by mammary-targeted Ha-Ras or c-Myc, enhanced gene expression profiles and immunohistochemical features of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and putative cancer stem cells in vivo. Silencing of p21(CIP1) enhanced, and expression of p21(CIP1) repressed, features of EMT in transformed immortal human MEC lines. p21(CIP1) attenuated oncogene-induced BT-IC and mammosphere formation. Thus, the in vitro cell culture assays reflect the changes observed in vivo in transgenic mice. These findings establish a link between the loss of p21(CIP1) and the acquisition of breast cancer EMT and stem cell properties in vivo.</docText>

        <docTitle>Contralateral Breast Cancer Risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.</docTitle>
        <docText>Contralateral Breast Cancer Risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.

PURPOSE: To estimate the risk for contralateral breast cancer in members of BRCA1- and BRCA2-positive families and to determine predictive risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study was performed from 1996 until 2008 and comprised 2,020 women with unilateral breast cancer (index patients, n = 978; relatives, n = 1,42) from 978 families who had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the association of age at first breast cancer with time from first to contralateral breast cancer, stratified by the affected BRCA gene. RESULTS: The cumulative risk for contralateral breast cancer 25 years after first breast cancer was 47.4% (95% CI, 38.8% to 56.0%) for patients from families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Members of families with BRCA1 mutations had a 1.6-fold (95% CI, 1.2-fold to 2.3-fold) higher risk of contralateral breast cancer than members of families with BRCA2 mutations. Younger age at first breast cancer was associated with a significantly higher risk of contralateral breast cancer in patients with BRCA1 mutation, and a trend was observed in patients with BRCA2 mutation. After 25 years, 62.9% (95% CI, 50.4% to 75.4%) of patients with BRCA1 mutation who were younger than 40 years of age at first breast cancer developed contralateral breast cancer, compared with only 19.6% (95% CI, 5.3% to 33.9%) of those who were older than 50 years of age at first breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Contralateral breast cancer risk depends on age at first breast cancer and on the affected BRCA gene, and this risk should be considered in treatment planning.</docText>

        <docText>Prognostic and predictive value of HER2 extracellular domain in metastatic breast cancer treated with lapatinib and paclitaxel in a randomized phase III study.

PURPOSE: The HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) is enzymatically cleaved from the cell membrane. Shed ECD in serum has been studied as both prognostic and predictive markers. Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor kinases. We examined the prognostic and predictive role of HER2 ECD in a randomized trial of paclitaxel with placebo or lapatinib in women with HER2-negative or -unknown breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 579) with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were randomly assigned to paclitaxel with placebo or lapatinib. HER2 status was determined centrally. ECD was centrally measured by enzyme linked immunoassay in available samples at baseline (b; n = 472), week 9, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Results were correlated to overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Elevated baseline ECD (bECD) levels (&gt;or= 16 ng/mL) did not predict HER2 tumor status (sensitivity, 62%; specificity, 75%). In HER2-negative tumors, elevated bECD was not correlated with improved efficacy for lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel (ORR: odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.1 to 3.8; P = .365; PFS: hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.47; P = .797). ECD levels tended to decrease over time when bECD was elevated. ECD conversion from low to high was associated with worse PFS. Converting from high to low was associated with a better PFS. A consistently low ECD level had better PFS than a consistently elevated ECD. All associations were found to be independent of lapatinib. CONCLUSION: HER2 bECD does not predict lapatinib benefit in patients with HER2-negative MBC. Changes in ECD status correlates with patient outcome regardless of treatment given. Measuring HER2 ECD is not currently recommended for predicting benefit to lapatinib.</docText>

        <docTitle>Phase II Multicenter Trial of Anthracycline Rechallenge With Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Plus Cyclophosphamide for First-Line Therapy of Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Adjuvant Anthracyclines.</docTitle>
        <docText>Phase II Multicenter Trial of Anthracycline Rechallenge With Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Plus Cyclophosphamide for First-Line Therapy of Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Adjuvant Anthracyclines.

PURPOSE: Anthracyclines are a component of breast cancer chemotherapy regimens in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Anthracycline rechallenge for metastatic disease, for those previously exposed to adjuvant anthracyclines, may not be considered because of concerns about efficacy, tolerability, and cumulative cardiotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial examined the efficacy and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) 35 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) as first-line therapy, delivered every 3 weeks, in 70 patients who developed metastatic disease more than 12 months after completion of an adjuvant anthracycline-containing regimen. Seven patients discontinued treatment early and were excluded from the efficacy analysis. RESULTS: After a median of six cycles, the objective response rate was 38%. An additional 33% of patients achieved stable disease lasting more than 6 months, for an overall clinical benefit rate of 71%. The estimated median time to progression was 12.2 months. Median overall survival time was 16.5 months. Clinical response was equally robust in patients with and without prior taxane exposure. Treatment was well tolerated. The most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE; 10%), dyspnea (9%), and neutropenia (9%). One (1.4%) of 70 patients discontinued treatment as a result of PPE. One patient (1.4%) experienced an infusion reaction requiring discontinuation. No symptomatic cardiac events were observed. CONCLUSION: PLD plus cyclophosphamide is effective and well tolerated in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received prior adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. The majority of patients experienced a clinical benefit without any significant impact on cardiac function.</docText>

        <docText>Novel gene rearrangements in transformed breast cells identified by high-resolution breakpoint analysis of chromosomal aberrations.

Chromosomal copy number alterations and chromosomal rearrangements are frequent mutations in human cancer. Unlike copy number alterations, little is known about the role and occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements in breast cancer. This may be due to the fact that chromosome-based breakpoint analysis is widely restricted to cultured cells. In order to identify gene rearrangements in breast cancer we studied the chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-transformed epithelial breast cell lines using a high-resolution array-based approach using 1Mb BAC arrays. The breakpoints were further narrowed down by FISH with clones from the 32k BAC library. The analysis of the cell lines B42-11 and B42-16 revealed rearrangements of chromosomes 7, 8, 10 and 12. We identified the genes Has2, Grid1, Ret, Cpm, Tbx3, Tbx5, Tuba1a, Wnt1 and Arf3 within the breakpoint regions. Quantitative RT-PCR showed a deregulated expression of all of these candidate genes except for Tbx5 and Tbx3. This is the first study demonstrating gene rearrangements and their deregulated mRNA expression in radiation-transformed breast cells. Since the gene rearrangements occurred in the transformed and tumourigenic cell lines only it is likely that these were generated in conjunction with malignant transformation of the epithelial breast cells and therefore might reflect early molecular events in breast carcinogenesis. Initial studies indicate that these gene alterations are also found in sporadic breast cancers.</docText>

        <docTitle>G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) is a transcriptional corepressor important for estrogen receptor alpha-mediated transcriptional regulation.</docTitle>
        <docText>G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) is a transcriptional corepressor important for estrogen receptor alpha-mediated transcriptional regulation.

We have identified G protein suppressor 2 (GPS2) as a stable component of the SMRT corepressor complexes. GPS2 potently represses basal transcription, with the repression domain mapped to the N-terminal SMRT-interacting domain. Knockdown of GPS2 abrogates, while overexpression potentiates, SMRT-mediated repression activity. The SMRT complexes are involved in 4-hydroxyl-tamoxifen (4OHT)-mediated gene repression by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). We show that 4OHT recruits SMRT and GPS2 to the promoter of pS2, an ERalpha target gene, in a dynamic manner. Unexpectedly, we also found that estradiol (E2) promotes promoter recruitment of the SMRT complexes. While knockdown of GPS2 compromised 4OHT-mediated repression, it enhanced E2-induced expression of a reporter gene and several endogenous ERalpha target genes, including pS2, cyclin D1 (CCND1), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-MYC. Finally, we show that depletion of GPS2 or SMRT by siRNA promotes cell proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Thus, we concluded that GPS2 is an integral component of the SMRT complexes, important for ligand-dependent gene regulations by ERalpha and a suppressor for MCF-7 cell proliferation.</docText>

        <docTitle>Quantitative analysis of changes in ER, PR and HER2 expression in primary breast cancer and paired nodal metastases.</docTitle>
        <docText>Quantitative analysis of changes in ER, PR and HER2 expression in primary breast cancer and paired nodal metastases.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of receptors [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)] is routinely carried out on primary tumour in order to select appropriate adjuvant therapy; the same analysis is not carried out on nodal metastases. Since de novo resistance to therapy is common, we quantified differences in receptor expression between primary and nodal disease in order to assess whether this might contribute to therapeutic resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 385 patients with invasive primary breast carcinomas and paired lymph nodes (n = 211) were assessed for ER, PR and HER2 expression using quantitative immunofluorescence. Cut-points were defined by comparison with tumours scored by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH. Differences in expression for each of the markers and molecular phenotype were analysed. RESULTS: Quantitative receptor expression shows a wide dynamic range compared with IHC. Overall, 46.9% cases had disparate breast/node receptor status of at least one receptor. Many of the differences in expression between primary tumour and node are large magnitude (greater than fivefold) changes. Triple-negative phenotype changes in 23.1% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients show discordant quantitative expression of molecular markers between primary and nodal disease. Appropriately measured, lymph node receptor status could be a more accurate measurement for guiding adjuvant therapy, which requires testing in a clinical trial.</docText>

        <docText>Low-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of breast ductal intraepithelial neoplasia: results of a large observational study.

BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen's cost-benefit ratio for breast ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN) is unclear. Since low-dose tamoxifen showed a favorable modulation of breast cancer biomarkers in phase II trials, a monoinstitutional cohort of women with DIN treated with low-dose tamoxifen or no systemic treatment was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 309 patients with DIN received low-dose tamoxifen as part of institutional guidelines and were compared with 371 patients with DIN who received no systemic treatment after surgery. RESULTS: Women with estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) &gt;50% DIN who were not treated had a higher incidence of breast events than women on tamoxifen [hazard ratio (HR) 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-3.12] or women with ER/PgR &lt;50% DIN (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.14-2.58). Among untreated patients with ER &gt;50% DIN, recurrence was higher in PgR &gt;/=50% DIN than in PgR &lt;50% DIN, whereas it was similar among low PgR (&lt;50%) DIN against which tamoxifen had no effect. No difference in endometrial cancer incidence was noted. CONCLUSIONS: High ER and especially high PgR expression is a significant adverse prognostic indicator of DIN, and low-dose tamoxifen appears to be an active treatment. Women with low-expression ER or PgR DIN do not seem to benefit from tamoxifen. A definitive clinical trial is warranted.</docText>

        <docText>Preliminary study of human breast tissue using synchrotron radiation combining WAXS and SAXS techniques.

Using synchrotron radiation, we combined simultaneously wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques to obtain the scattering profiles of normal and neoplastic breast tissues samples at the momentum transfer range 6.28nm(-1)&lt;/=Q(=4pi.sin(theta/2)/lambda)&lt;/=50.26nm(-1) and 0.15nm(-1)&lt;/=Q&lt;/=1.90nm(-1), respectively. The results obtained show considerable differences between the scattering profiles of these tissues. We verified that the combination of some parameters (ratio between glandular and adipose peak intensity and third-order axial peak intensity) extracted from scattering profiles can be used for identifying breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Flare phenomenon in positron emission tomography in a case of breast cancer--a pitfall of positron emission tomography imaging interpretation.

We present an unusual case of breast cancer with increased FDG uptake 4 months after chemotherapy. A PET-CT scan displayed results that mimicked multiple lymph node metastases in the right axilla, the mediastinum, and the bilateral pulmonary hilar regions. However, the increased FDG uptake disappeared 17 months later without any additional medical treatment, suggesting the occurrence of flare phenomenon.</docText>

        <docText>Radiation response of cancer stem-like cells from established human cell lines after sorting for surface markers.

PURPOSE: A subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells (CSLC) is hypothesized to exist in different cancer cell lines and to mediate radioresistance in solid tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cells were stained for CSLC markers and sorted (fluorescence-activated cell sorter/magnetic beads) to compare foci and radiosensitivity of phosphorylated histone H2AX at Ser 139 (gamma-H2AX) in sorted vs. unsorted populations in eight cell lines from different organs. CSLC properties were examined using anchorage-independent growth and levels of activated Notch1. Validation consisted of testing tumorigenicity and postirradiation enrichment of CSLC in xenograft tumors. RESULTS: The quantity of CSLC was generally in good agreement with primary tumors. CSLC from MDA-MB-231 (breast) and Panc-1 and PSN-1 (both pancreatic) cells had fewer residual gamma-H2AX foci than unsorted cells, pointing to radioresistance of CSLC. However, only MDA-MB-231 CSLC were more radioresistant than unsorted cells. Furthermore, MDA-MB-231 CSLC showed enhanced anchorage-independent growth and overexpression of activated Notch1 protein. The expression of cancer stem cell surface markers in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model was increased after exposure to fractionated radiation. In contrast to PSN-1 cells, a growth advantage for MDA-MB-231 CSLC xenograft tumors was found compared to tumors arising from unsorted cells. CONCLUSIONS: CSLC subpopulations showed no general radioresistant phenotype, despite the quantities of CSLC subpopulations shown to correspond relatively well in other reports. Likewise, CSLC characteristics were found in some but not all of the tested cell lines. The reported problems in testing for CSLC in cell lines may be overcome by additional techniques, beyond sorting for markers.</docText>

        <docText>Stroma in breast development and disease.

It is increasingly apparent that normal and malignant breast tissues require complex local and systemic stromal interactions for development and progression. During development, mammary cell fate specification and differentiation require highly regulated contextual signals derived from the stroma. Likewise, during breast carcinoma development, the tissue stroma can provide tumor suppressing and tumor-promoting environments that serve to regulate neoplastic growth of the epithelium. This review focuses on the role of the stroma as a mediator of normal mammary development, as well as a critical regulator of malignant conversion and progression in breast cancer. Recognition of the important role of the stroma during the progression of breast cancers leads to the possibility of new targets for treatment of the initial breast cancer lesion as well as prevention of recurrence.</docText>

        <docText>Conjugated and non-conjugated androgens differentially modulate specific early gene transcription in breast cancer in a cell-specific manner.

The role of androgen in breast cancer development is not fully understood, although androgen receptors (ARs) have been identified in breast cancer clinical samples and cell lines. However the whole spectrum of androgen actions cannot be accounted to the classic AR activation and the possible existence of a cell surface-AR has been suggested. Indeed, androgen, like all steroids, has been reported to trigger membrane-initiated signaling activity and exert specific actions, including ion channels and kinase signaling pathway activation, ultimately affecting gene expression. However, the molecular nature of membrane androgen sites represents another major persisting question. In the present study, we investigated early transcriptional effects of testosterone and the impermeable testosterone-BSA conjugate, in two breast cancer cell lines (T47D and MDA-MB-231), in an attempt to decipher specific genes modified in each case, providing evidences about specific membrane-initiating actions. Our data indicate that the two agents affect the expression of several genes. A group of genes were commonly affected while others were uniquely modified by each agent, including interaction with growth factors and K(+)-channels. In MDA-MB-231 cells, that are AR negative, the majority of genes affected by testosterone were also affected by testosterone-BSA indicating a membrane-initiated action. Subsequent analysis revealed that the two agents trigger different molecular pathways and cellular/molecular functions, suggestive of a molecular or functional heterogeneity of membrane and intracellular AR. In addition, the reported phenotypic interactions of membrane-acting androgen with growth factor were verified at the transcriptomic level, as well as their ion channel-modifying effects. Finally an interesting interplay between membrane-acting androgen with inflammation-related molecules, with potential clinical implications was revealed.</docText>

        <docTitle>Use of antidepressants for management of hot flashes.</docTitle>
        <docText>Use of antidepressants for management of hot flashes.

A growing body of evidence suggests that antidepressant therapies, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine, are effective in the management of hot flash symptoms. Several of these agents have the support of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the North American Menopause Society. To review the literature on antidepressants for the treatment of hot flashes in women, we searched the PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and MEDLINE databases from inception through May 2009. All publication types that included human participants and that were published in English were eligible for review. These articles, relevant abstracts, and additional references were used to collect pertinent data. Although initial small pilot trials were conducted solely in breast cancer survivors, additional studies have been conducted both in breast cancer survivors and in relatively healthy menopausal women. Data on the benefits with many of these agents are conflicting. Venlafaxine and paroxetine have been studied more extensively than any of the other antidepressants and are more consistent in effectively reducing the frequency and severity of hot flashes, based on these study results. Desvenlafaxine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and citalopram should be considered second- or third-line options if patients fail therapy with or cannot tolerate venlafaxine or paroxetine, based on the current published data. Duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, and mirtazapine should be reserved as last-line therapy until more rigorous studies are conducted assessing their use in the management of hot flashes.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy in the United States.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of 5 years of treatment with hormone therapy (HT) compared with no treatment for women with menopausal symptoms in the United States. METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation model was used with tunnel techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness of HT in women aged 50 years, based on a societal perspective. Clinical data, where possible, used results taken from the Women Health Initiative (WHI). The model had a lifetime horizon with cycle lengths of 1 year and contained the following disease states: hip fracture, vertebral fracture, wrist fracture, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events. An intervention was modelled by its impact on the disease risks during and after stopping treatment. The model required data on clinical effects, risks, mortality rates, quality of life weights, and costs. The main outcome of the model was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained on HT compared with no treatment. RESULTS: The results indicated that it was cost-effective to treat women with menopausal symptoms with HT in the United States. The severity of menopausal symptoms was the single most important determinant of cost-effectiveness, but HT remained cost-effective even where symptoms were mild or effects on symptom relief were small. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of women with menopausal symptoms with HT is cost-effective.</docText>

        <docText>Aberrant Changes of Wnt2/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway Induced by Sodium Nitroprusside in Human Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines.

ABSTRACT Inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is an attractive method for therapy of various tumors including breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, etc. However, little is known about the role of Wnt2/beta-catenin pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here we identify that Wnt2/beta-catenin signaling pathway is activated in ESCC cells, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and siRNA against beta-catenin not only inhibit the expressions of beta-catenin and its major downstream effectors including c-myc and cyclin D1, but induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting that Wnt2/beta-catenin pathway may be a potential molecular target for ESCC therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Prospective Study on Combination of Electrical Impedance Scanning and Ultrasound in Estimating Risk of Development of Breast Cancer in Young Women.

ABSTRACT Based on cost-effective ratio, there has not yet been imaging methods suitable for breast cancer screening in young women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the combination of electrical impedance scanning (EIS) and ultrasound in identifying breast cancer for young women, to calculate relative risks, and to determine whether there has been some more accurate imaging method used in early detection of breast cancer in young women. A prospective and multicenter clinical study was conducted in young women aged 45 years and under. The young women (583 cases) scheduled for mammary biopsy underwent EIS and ultrasound, respectively. EIS and ultrasound results were compared with final histopathology results. Study end points included sensitivities and specificities of EIS, ultrasound and the combination method, as well as relative probability of breast cancer of positive patients detected by the combination of EIS and ultrasound. Of the 583 cases, 143 were diagnosed with breast cancer. The sensitivities of EIS, ultrasound and the combination method were 86.7% (124/143), 72% (103/143), and 93.7% (134/143); the specificities were 72.9% (321/440), 82.5% (363/440), and 64.1% (282/440), and the relative possibilities of breast cancer for the positive young women detected by EIS, ultrasound, and the combination method were 8.67, 5.77, and 14.84, respectively. The combination of EIS and ultrasound is likely to become an applicable method for early detection of breast cancer in young women.</docText>

        <docText>Liquid Chromatography-Tandem and MALDI Imaging Mass Spectrometry Analyses of RCL2/CS100-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Tissues: Proteomics Evaluation of an Alternate Fixative for Biomarker Discovery.

Human tissues are an important source of biological material for the discovery of novel biomarkers. Fresh-frozen tissue could represent an ideal supply of archival material for molecular investigations. However, immediate flash freezing is usually not possible, especially for rare or valuable tissue samples such as biopsies. Here, we investigated the compatibility of RCL2/CS100, a non-cross-linking, nontoxic, and nonvolatile organic fixative, with shotgun proteomic analyses. Several protein extraction protocols compatible with mass spectrometry were investigated from RCL2/CS100-fixed and fresh-frozen colonic mucosa, breast, and prostate tissues. The peptides and proteins identified from RCL2/CS100 tissue were then comprehensively compared with those identified from matched fresh-frozen tissues using a bottom-up strategy based on nano-reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoRPLC-MS/MS). Results showed that similar peptides could be identified in both archival conditions and the proteome coverage was not obviously compromised by the RCL2/CS100 fixation process. NanoRPLC-MS/MS of laser capture microdissected RCL2/CS100-fixed tissues gave the same amount of biological information as that recovered from whole RCL2/CS100-fixed or frozen tissues. We next performed MALDI tissue profiling and imaging mass spectrometry and observed a high level of agreement in protein expression as well as excellent agreement between the images obtained from RCL2/CS100-fixed and fresh-frozen tissue samples. These results suggest that RCL2/CS100-fixed tissues are suitable for shotgun proteomic analyses and tissue imaging. More importantly, this alternate fixative opens the door to the analysis of small, valuable, and rare target lesions that are usually inaccessible to complementary biomarker-driven genomic and proteomic research.</docText>

        <docTitle>Fulminant liver failure in a patient affected by polycystic liver disease and liver metastases from breast carcinoma.</docTitle>
        <docText>Fulminant liver failure in a patient affected by polycystic liver disease and liver metastases from breast carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare, congenital, benign condition characterized by the presence of multiple bile-duct-derived epithelial cysts in the liver parenchyma. The disease is usually asymptomatic, but cyst growth can result in complications such as ascites, esophageal varices, jaundice and hepatic failure. The exact mechanism leading to cyst growth is unclear, but estrogenic stimulation and paracrine action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are thought to play a role in the growth of cyst epithelium. CASE REPORT: We report a case of acute liver failure in a young woman with PLD and liver metastases from breast carcinoma. RESULTS: No data are available in the literature about metastatic liver involvement in PLD patients affected by breast cancer. The prognosis of patients with liver metastases is generally poor but fulminant liver failure is a very rare occurrence. Estrogen stimulation seems to be a risk factor for breast cancer and severe PLD. In the reported case, the presence of either the cysts or the metastatic lesions may have resulted in more extensive liver damage. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of drugs selected in relation to their hepatic toxicity together with careful monitoring of liver function is warranted in the management of breast cancer patients affected by PLD, in order to reduce the risk of liver failure.</docText>

        <docText>Adaptive radiation therapy in a patient with a massive nodal breast cancer recurrence.

Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is the next improvement in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). ART consists in changing treatment delivery to compensate for changes in patient anatomy or tumor volume. The treatment planning is therefore adapted to the new target volume. By daily imaging, the tumor volume can be assessed and compared with the initial volume. In case of tumor progression or tumor response, a new plan can be obtained to adequately treat the new volume. We report the use of ART with the Plan Adaptive software of TomoTherapy Inc. in a patient with massive breast cancer recurrence in the axilla. Between the CT simulation and the first day of radiotherapy the axillary lesion progressed. Megavolt CT performed to image-guide the treatment showed impressive growth of the lesion, which went out of the treatment field. By studying the dose distribution on the new anatomy, we found that the planning target volume was substantially undercovered by the prescription dose. Adaptive planning was performed using the anatomical information acquired by the megavolt CT.</docText>

        <docText>Gemcitabine-induced supraventricular tachycardia.

The superior toxicity profile is one of the major reasons for the widespread use of gemcitabine in cancer treatment. Bone marrow suppression is the most common side effect, while non-hematological events are relatively infrequent. Cardiac toxicity is a rare complication and cardiac arrhythmia is even rarer. We report the case of a 67-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer without a history of cardiac arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease who developed supraventricular tachycardia. The symptoms had started immediately after gemcitabine treatment. The arrhythmia responded poorly to common treatment and was eventually controlled by oral propranolol five days after admission. The present case suggests that supraventricular tachycardia may be triggered by gemcitabine even without underlying significant heart disease and may be resistant to conventional therapy.</docText>

        <docTitle>Coexistent malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.</docTitle>
        <docText>Coexistent malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.

Patients with malignant melanoma are at an increased risk of developing subsequent primary melanomas and also nonmelanoma cutaneous cancers. Several studies have reported an association between malignant melanoma and breast cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, neuroectodermal tumours, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukaemia and renal cell carcinoma. We report a case series of patients with a diagnosis of malignant melanoma who also developed a renal mass. In two of these cases, the renal mass became apparent on diagnostic imaging as part of the staging investigations at the time of initial diagnosis of the malignant melanoma. In both of these cases, biopsy of the renal mass confirmed the presence of a separate primary renal cell carcinoma which had presented concurrently with the malignant melanoma. A third case presented with bone metastases ten years after excision of a thin melanoma. Further imaging revealed pulmonary metastases and a renal mass, biopsy of which confirmed renal cell carcinoma. In contrast, a fourth patient underwent a right nephrectomy for a renal mass having presented with abdominal discomfort. The histology of this lesion was in keeping with metastatic melanoma, and the patient's past history included a diagnosis of ocular melanoma eight years prior to the development of metastatic disease in the right kidney. Survival rates for patients with many types of malignant disease are improving, and there have been significant advances in clinical imaging techniques. Consequently the development and detection of a second primary cancer, either presenting concurrently or on subsequent follow-up, is likely to be increasingly observed. The series of patients reported here highlights the importance of a diagnostic biopsy in patients with malignant melanoma who develop a renal mass in order to establish a diagnosis and to plan optimal treatment.</docText>

        <docTitle>Docetaxel and gemcitabine in the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma: a dose finding study.</docTitle>
        <docText>Docetaxel and gemcitabine in the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma: a dose finding study.

AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines for advanced disease are usually refractory to any further treatment with anthracyclines and have a poor prognosis. Therefore, new drugs or new combinations of drugs are needed. One approach has been to focus on the type of chemotherapy with low toxicity that preserves quality of life during treatment, such as weekly drug administration. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a dose-finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine plus docetaxel, given on a weekly schedule in metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines. Three escalating doses of gemcitabine (900, 1000 and 1100 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 in combination with a fixed dose of docetaxel, 35 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 were planned. Dose-limiting toxicity included grade &gt; 3 hematologic toxicity, grade &gt; 2 stomatitis, asthenia, diarrhea or organ-specific toxicity (except alopecia). Dose escalation was stopped if 1 out of 3 patients at any dose level experienced dose-limiting toxicity. RESULTS: Nine patients received a mean of 5.1 (range, 1-9) cycles. Gastrointestinal and leukopenia were the main dose-limiting toxicity. No patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity at dose level 1; at dose level 2, 2 out of 3 patients had dose-limiting toxicity and 3 additional patients treated at dose level 2 confirmed that the maximum tolerated dose had been reached. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended gemcitabine dose in combination with docetaxel (35 mg/m2 for a phase II study) was established at 900 mg/m2.</docText>

        <docText>Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide or docetaxel as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer: a retrospective analysis.

AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin play a central role in the management of advanced breast cancer. Unfortunately, the clinical benefits of anthracyclines are limited by cardiotoxicity that can lead to the development of potentially fatal congestive heart failure. In order to limit anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity, liposomal formulations of doxorubicin have been developed. This retrospective analysis evaluated the experience obtained with non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as first-line therapy in 34 patients with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Patients received non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with either cyclophosphamide (n = 14) or docetaxel (n = 20) for up to eight cycles, and efficacy and safety were assessed according to standard criteria. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 71%. The median progression-free survival was 8 months in patients receiving non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and 13.8 months in those receiving non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus docetaxel (P = 0.2). The most commonly observed toxicities were grade 1-2 leucopenia, alopecia, nausea and vomiting; no grade 3-4 toxicities were observed. Overall, three patients (9%) experienced grade 1 cardiac toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as an alternative to conventional doxorubicin formulations in combination regimens for the first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Synthesis of 2-fluoro N(10)-substituted acridones and their cytotoxicity studies in sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines and their DNA intercalation studies.

A series of 2-fluoro N(10)-substituted acridone derivatives with varying alkyl side chain length with propyl, butyl substitution, and a tertiary amine group at the terminal end of the alkyl side chain were synthesized and screened against cancer cell lines SW 1573, SW 1573 2R 160 (P-gp substrate) which are non-small lung cancer cell lines, MCF-7, MCF-7/MR (BCRP substrate) are breast cancer cell lines, 2008 WT, 2008MRP1, 2008MRP2, 2008MRP3 are ovarian cancer cell lines, and human embryo kidney cell lines like HEK293, HEK293 MRP4, and HEK293 MRP5i. The propyl-series compounds showed lipophilicity in the range of 1.93 to 4.40 and the butyl series in the range of 2.37 to 4.78. The compounds 4, 7, and 8 showed good cytotoxicity against the 60 human cancer cell line panel of the National Cancer Institute, USA. The compounds 14 and 15 showed a better cytotoxicity in most of the cancer cell lines compared to other compounds tested. The DNA-binding properties of the compounds were evaluated based on their affinity or intercalation with CT-DNA measured with absorption titration. The compound 11 bearing planar tricyclic ring linked with a butyl methylpiperazino side chain showed the highest binding affinity with a binding constant (K(i)) of 10.38 x 10 M(-1). Evaluation of the compounds in cell lines with an overexpression of various multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), or Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) showed that all compounds are not substrates for any of these transporters.</docText>

        <docTitle>Low risk variants FGFR2, TNRC9 and LSP1 in German familial breast cancer patients.</docTitle>
        <docText>Low risk variants FGFR2, TNRC9 and LSP1 in German familial breast cancer patients.

To validate common low risk variants predisposing for breast cancer in a large set of BRCA1/2 negative familial or genetically enriched cases from Germany, we genotyped 1415 cases and 1830 healthy women by MALDI-TOF in 105 candidate SNPs. A significantly higher OR than previously reported for heterozygous unselected cases was found for the minor allele in FGFR2 (OR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.30-1.59, p-value = 1.24 x 10(-12)), while an OR approaching genome-wide significance was found for TNRC9 (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.19-1.46, p-value = 1.54 x 10(-7)) in familial cases. Most intriguing however, were the ORs for homozygous carriers from high risk families for FGFR2 (OR = 2.05, 95%CI 1.68-2.51, LSP1 (OR = 0.49, 95%CI 0.28-0.86) and TNRC9 (OR = 1.62, 95%CI 1.27-2.07). Moreover, the additional validation of 99 CGEMS-SNPs identified putative novel susceptibility alleles within the LSP1 gene (OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.61-0.87, p-value = 5.23 x 10(-4)). Finally, we provide evidence for the first time that a low risk variant located at 6q22.33 (rs6569479) is associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer in familial cases (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.06-1.66; p-value = 0.012). Our data confirm the impact of the previously identified susceptibility loci and provide preliminary evidence for novel susceptibility loci in familial breast cancer cases and correlate them to specific histopathological subtypes defined by estrogen receptor status.

        <docTitle>Synergism from combined immunologic and pharmacologic inhibition of HER2 in vivo.</docTitle>
        <docText>Synergism from combined immunologic and pharmacologic inhibition of HER2 in vivo.

The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib improve the clinical outcome of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. However, the majority of metastatic cancers will eventually progress suggesting the need for other therapies. Because HER2 overexpression persists, we hypothesized that the anti-HER2 immune response induced by cancer vaccines would be an effective strategy for treating trastuzumab and lapatinib-refractory tumors. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the antibody response could synergize with lapatinib to enhance tumor inhibition. We developed a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing a kinase-inactive HER2 (Ad-HER2-ki) to use as a cancer vaccine. Vaccine-induced polyclonal HER2-specific anti-serum was analyzed for receptor internalization and signaling effects alone and in combination with lapatinib. Ad-HER2-ki vaccine induced potent T cell and antibody responses in mice and the vaccine-induced polyclonal HER2-specific anti-serum mediated receptor internalization and degradation much more effectively than trastuzumab. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that HER2-vaccine induced antibodies effectively caused a decrease in HER2 expression, but when combined with lapatinib caused significant inhibition of HER2 signaling, decreased pERK and pAKT levels, and reduced breast tumor cell proliferation. In addition, a known mechanism of resistance to lapatinib, induction of survivin, was inhibited. The combination of Ad-HER2-ki plus lapatinib also showed superior anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Based on these results, we feel clinical studies using this approach to target HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, including trastuzumab- and lapatinib-resistant tumors is warranted.

        <docTitle>A bivariate survival model with compound Poisson frailty.</docTitle>
        <docText>A bivariate survival model with compound Poisson frailty.

A correlated frailty model is suggested for analysis of bivariate time-to-event data. The model is an extension of the correlated power variance function (PVF) frailty model (correlated three-parameter frailty model) (J. Epidemiol. Biostat. 1999; 4:53-60). It is based on a bivariate extension of the compound Poisson frailty model in univariate survival analysis (Ann. Appl. Probab. 1992; 4:951-972). It allows for a non-susceptible fraction (of zero frailty) in the population, overcoming the common assumption in survival analysis that all individuals are susceptible to the event under study. The model contains the correlated gamma frailty model and the correlated inverse Gaussian frailty model as special cases. A maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the parameters is presented and its properties are studied in a small simulation study. This model is applied to breast cancer incidence data of Swedish twins. The proportion of women susceptible to breast cancer is estimated to be 15 per cent.

        <docText>Citrus fruit and cancer risk in a network of case-control studies.

BACKGROUND: Citrus fruit has shown a favorable effect against various cancers. To better understand their role in cancer risk, we analyzed data from a series of case-control studies conducted in Italy and Switzerland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The studies included 955 patients with oral and pharyngeal cancer, 395 with esophageal, 999 with stomach, 3,634 with large bowel, 527 with laryngeal, 2,900 with breast, 454 with endometrial, 1,031 with ovarian, 1,294 with prostate, and 767 with renal cell cancer. All cancers were incident and histologically confirmed. Controls were admitted to the same network of hospitals for acute, nonneoplastic conditions. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated by multiple logistic regression models, including terms for major identified confounding factors for each cancer site, and energy intake. RESULTS: The ORs for the highest versus lowest category of citrus fruit consumption were 0.47 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.36-0.61) for oral and pharyngeal, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.25-0.70) for esophageal, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.52-0.92) for stomach, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.93) for colorectal, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.37-0.83) for laryngeal cancer. No consistent association was found with breast, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and renal cell cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that citrus fruit has a protective role against cancers of the digestive and upper respiratory tract.</docText>

        <docTitle>Serum calcium levels are elevated among women with untreated postmenopausal breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Serum calcium levels are elevated among women with untreated postmenopausal breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Reports of an association between primary hyperparathyroidism in women and risk of breast cancer suggest an etiologic role for high serum calcium. However, data on the association between serum calcium levels and breast cancer in women without clinical hyperparathyroidism are limited. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study among postmenopausal women in Fargo, ND. Cases were women aged 65 and older with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed breast cancer. Controls were aged 65 and older without clinical cancer who were seen at the same hospital. RESULTS: We obtained data on 190 white cases and 172 white controls. Primary hyperparathyroidism (an abnormally high calcium level confirmed by an abnormally high serum PTH) was found in 3/190 cases and in 0/172 controls (p = 0.25). After excluding the women with primary hyperparathyroidism, the mean calcium levels among cases was 9.6 mg/dL (range, 7.5-11.0, SD = 0.47) vs. 9.4 mg/dL (7.7-10.5, 0.43) among the controls (p &lt; 0.0001). Comparing women in the top with women in the bottom tertile of serum calcium, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer was 5.21 (95% CI: 2.59-10.48). There was no relationship between serum calcium and tumor size or stage. CONCLUSION: The distribution of serum calcium levels among postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer was shifted significantly toward the right. These findings are consistent with an effect of early breast tumors on calcium homeostasis. However, the lack of association between serum calcium levels and tumor size or stage supports the hypothesis that subclinical hyperparathyroidism may increase the risk for breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Genetic variants in GSTM3 gene within GSTM4-GSTM2-GSTM1-GSTM5-GSTM3 cluster influence breast cancer susceptibility depending on GSTM1.</docTitle>
        <docText>Genetic variants in GSTM3 gene within GSTM4-GSTM2-GSTM1-GSTM5-GSTM3 cluster influence breast cancer susceptibility depending on GSTM1.

Mu class of Glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM) genes arrange in a tandem on chromosome 1p13.3. The relationship between genetic variants in the GSTM1-5 gene cluster and breast cancer is still ambiguous. In the present study, 17 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the GSTMs cluster were originally selected and 11 validated SNPs were used for genotyping 921 cases and 711 controls. The association analyses were performed according to the absence or presence of GSTM1. In the GSTM1-/- group, the allele frequency of one SNP in GSTM3 was significantly different between cases and controls (P = 2.0 x 10(-4), corrected P = 0.001), with odds ratio of 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.44). The observed association in the GSTM1-/- group was successfully replicated in an independent population set (familial/early-onset breast cancer cases, n = 267; community-based controls, n = 667). The combined P values were robust (10(-6)) and the false positive report probability (FPRP) values were low. In contrast, no susceptibility allele/haplotype was identified when the GSTM1 gene was present. Based on epidemiological observations, we further identified two genetic variants in the GSTM3 locus accounting for differential expression of GSTM3 in normal breast tissues by such means as altering binding of RNA-pol-II. Protective genotypes were correlated with higher GSTM3 expression levels. In conclusion, SNPs/haplotypes in the GSTM3 gene within the GSTMs gene cluster are likely to contribute to breast cancer risk when the GSTM1 is absent. We infer that GSTM3 catalyzing ability in normal breast tissue might protect against breast carcinogenesis.</docText>

        <docText>Cardiac safety of trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment for Japanese patients with early breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Recently, randomized trials revealed that trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment was effective in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients. Safety information on adjuvant trastuzumab use in Japanese patients, especially cardiac toxicity data, is needed. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer who were treated with curative surgery and adjuvant trastuzumab at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Japan). The cardiac safety as well as the short-term efficacy of trastuzumab were evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 54 years. All patients received adjuvant or neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy. Twenty-seven patients (56%) received adjuvant radiation therapy. Forty-four patients (92%) received trastuzumab without concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy and 4 patients (8%) on taxanes received trastuzumab concurrently. Twenty-five patients completed 1 year of trastuzumab treatment and 5 patients completed 2 years of trastuzumab treatment. Nine patients discontinued trastuzumab treatment, because of progressive disease (1 patient), decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 2 patients), patient's refusal (4 patients), and other reasons (2 patients). There were five cardiac events. A decrease in LVEF to less than 50% was seen in 2 patients. The relationship between trastuzumab treatment and the cardiac events was unclear in 3 patients. The median follow-up time was 21.2 months. The disease-free survival (DFS) was 97.5% at 1 year and 92.9% at 2 years. CONCLUSION: The incidence of cardiac events caused by trastuzumab treatment was low in our analysis. Adjuvant trastuzumab treatment for up to at least 1 year should be safe for Japanese breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>Homeostasis of peripheral FoxP3(+) CD4 (+) regulatory T cells in patients with early and late stage breast cancer.

FoxP3( + ) CD4( + ) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important mediators of peripheral immune tolerance, acting via multiple mechanisms to suppress cellular immunity including antitumor responses. Although therapeutic strategies have been proposed to deplete Tregs in patients with breast cancer and other malignancies, dynamic changes in the Treg compartment as a function of stage and treatment of breast cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells and FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells from 45 patients with early or late stage breast cancer and compared percentages, absolute counts, and Treg function to those from healthy volunteers (HV) of comparable age. Patients having completed adjuvant chemotherapy and patients with metastatic cancer exhibited significantly lower absolute CD4 counts and significantly higher percentages of FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, the absolute counts of circulating FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells did not differ significantly among early stage patients, late stage patients, or HV. Functionally, FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells from all donor groups similarly expressed CTLA-4 and failed to secrete IFN-gamma in response to stimulation. Thus, although Tregs comprise an increased percentage of circulating CD4(+) T cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer and patients in remission after completing the adjuvant chemotherapy, the systemic Treg pool, as measured by absolute counts, appears relatively constant regardless of disease stage or treatment status. Total CD4(+) T cell counts are not constant, however, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms, or susceptibility to cytotoxic or malignant insults, fundamentally differ for regulatory and non-regulatory CD4(+) T cells.</docText>

        <docText>Capsaicin causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in ER-positive and -negative breast cancer cells by modulating the EGFR/HER-2 pathway.

Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is an ingredient of chili peppers with inhibitory effects against cancer cells of different origin. We examined the activity of capsaicin on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The drug potently inhibited growth of ER-positive (MCF-7, T47D, BT-474) and ER-negative (SKBR-3, MDA-MB231) breast cancer cell lines, which was associated with G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest, increased levels of apoptosis and reduced protein expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER-2, activated extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclin D1. In contrast, cell-cycle regulator p27(KIP1), caspase activity as well as poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage were increased. Notably, capsaicin blocked breast cancer cell migration in vitro and decreased by 50% the size of MDA-MB231 breast cancer tumors growing orthotopically in immunodeficient mice without noticeable drug side effects. in vivo activation of ERK was clearly decreased, as well as expression of HER-2 and cyclin D1, whereas caspase activity and PARP cleavage products were increased in tumors of drug-treated mice. Besides, capsaicin potently inhibited the development of pre-neoplastic breast lesions by up to 80% without evidence of toxicity. Our data indicate that capsaicin is a novel modulator of the EGFR/HER-2 pathway in both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer cells with a potential role in the treatment and prevention of human breast cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 October 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.335.</docText>

        <docText>Inhibitors of HSP90 block p95-HER2 signaling in Trastuzumab-resistant tumors and suppress their growth.

The anti-HER2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer; resistance, however, invariably emerges in metastatic tumors. The expression of p95-HER2, a form of HER2 with a truncated extracellular domain that lacks the Trastuzumab binding epitope, has been implicated as a mechanism of resistance to the antibody. We utilized an in vivo tumor model that overexpresses p95-HER2 and showed it to be resistant to the signaling and antitumor effects of Trastuzumab. We find that both full-length and p95-HER2 interact with the HSP90 chaperone protein and are degraded in tumor cells exposed to HSP90 inhibitors in tissue culture and in vivo. Loss of expression of p95-HER2 is accompanied by downregulation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways and inhibition of cell proliferation. Chronic administration of HSP90 inhibitors in vivo results in sustained loss of HER2 and p95-HER2 expression and inhibition of AKT activation, together with induction of apoptosis and complete inhibition of tumor growth in Trastuzumab-resistant, p95-HER2-overexpressing models. Thus, p95-HER2 is an HSP90 client protein, the expression and function of which can be effectively suppressed in vivo by HSP90 inhibitors. HSP90 inhibition is therefore a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for p95-HER2-mediated Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 October 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.337.</docText>

        <docText>Prevention of premature senescence requires JNK regulation of Bcl-2 and reactive oxygen species.

Premature senescence is considered as a cellular defense mechanism to prevent tumorigenesis. Although recent evidences show that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is involved in the senescence process, the mechanism for this regulation is not fully understood. Here, we examined the role of JNK in premature senescence of tumor cells. Treatment of cells with the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 caused phenotypical changes of senescence and triggered a rapid increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA-damage response (DDR) in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. ROS generation was attributed to the suppression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) phosphorylation, and resulted in DNA damage and p53 activation. Bax did not change their localization to the mitochondria, which is required for apoptosis. The essential roles of JNK and phosphorylated Bcl-2 in preventing premature senescence were confirmed using RNA interference and ectopic expression of mutants of Bcl-2, including phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable forms. These findings were evidenced in H460 lung carcinoma cells and primary human embryonic fibroblasts. Altogether, our results showed that loss of JNK activity triggers a Bcl-2/ROS/DDR signaling cascade that ultimately leads to premature senescence, indicating that basal JNK activity is essential in preventing premature senescence.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 October 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.355.</docText>

        <docText>Serum protein signature may improve detection of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is part of a spectrum of preinvasive lesions that originate within normal breast tissue and progress to invasive breast cancer. The detection of DCIS is important for the reduction of mortality from breast cancer, but the diagnosis of preinvasive breast tumors is hampered by the lack of an adequate detection method. To identify the changes in protein expression during the initial stage of tumorigenesis and to identify the presence of new DCIS markers, we analysed serum from 60 patients with breast cancer and 60 normal controls using mass spectrometry. A 23-protein index was generated that correctly distinguishes the DCIS and control groups with sensitivities and specificities in excess of 80% in two independent cohorts. Two candidate peptides were purified and identified as platelet factor 4 (PF-4) and complement C3a(desArg) anaphylatoxin (C3a(desArg)) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In an independent serum set of 165 patients, PF-4 and C3a(desArg) were significantly upregulated in DCIS compared with non-cancerous controls, as validated using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We conclude that our serum protein-based test, used in conjunction with image-based screening practices, could improve the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 October 2009; doi:10.1038/onc.2009.341.</docText>

        <docText>Triple-negative breast cancer: clinicopathological characteristics and relationship with basal-like breast cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer, defined as that with negative expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and cerbB2, accounted for 11% of invasive breast cancers in our study, drawn from an original cohort of 7048 women diagnosed with breast cancer from the files of the Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, over 14 years. Women with triple-negative breast cancer were generally postmenopausal, with adverse pathological characteristics of high histological grade and frequent nodal metastases. Using a set of 61 invasive breast cancers earlier profiled into molecular subtypes with expression arrays, we defined specificity and sensitivity values for different immunohistochemical panels of basal keratins (CK5/6, CK14, CK17, 34betaE12), CD117, EGFR, p63 and SMA in defining basal-like breast cancer. Subsequent application of a tri-panel of CK14, EGFR and 34betaE12 (specificity 100% and sensitivity 78%) to our group of 653 triple-negative breast cancers delineated 84% to be basal-like. Immunohistochemical expression of individual biological markers correlated with unfavorable pathological parameters. We conclude that triple-negative breast cancers in an Asian population harbor adverse pathobiological features, and an immunohistochemical surrogate panel can be reliably used to define basal-like cancers among them.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 23 October 2009; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2009.145.</docText>

        <docText>ATX-LPA receptor axis in inflammation and cancer.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 1- or 2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) mediates a plethora of physiological and pathological activities via interactions with a series of high affinity G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Both LPA receptor family members and autotaxin (ATX/LysoPLD), the primary LPA-producing enzyme, are aberrantly expressed in many human breast cancers and several other cancer lineages. Using transgenic mice expressing either an LPA receptor or ATX, we recently demonstrated that the ATX-LPA receptor axis plays a causal role in breast tumorigenesis and cancer-related inflammation, further validating the ATX-LPA receptor axis as a rich therapeutic target in cancer.</docText>

        <docText>A perspective on challenges and issues in biomarker development and drug and biomarker codevelopment.

A workshop sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the US Food and Drug Administration addressed past lessons learned and ongoing challenges faced in biomarker development and drug and biomarker codevelopment. Participants agreed that critical decision points in the product life cycle depend on the level of understanding of the biology of the target and its interaction with the drug, the preanalytical and analytical factors affecting biomarker assay performance, and the clinical disease process. The more known about the biology and the greater the strength of association between an analytical signal and clinical result, the more efficient and less risky the development process will be. Rapid entry into clinical practice will only be achieved by using a rigorous scientific approach, including careful specimen collection and standardized and quality-controlled data collection. Early interaction with appropriate regulatory bodies will ensure studies are appropriately designed and biomarker test performance is well characterized.</docText>

BACKGROUND: Both religiosity and hope are known for their positive role in coping with cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the mediating role of hope between religiosity and coping for women diagnosed with breast cancer. METHOD: Israeli Jewish women with breast cancer (N=233) completed the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale, The Systems of Belief Inventory, and The Hope Scale. RESULTS: By use of hierarchical regression, hope was found to be a mediator between religiosity and three coping styles. CONCLUSION: Special attention should be given to the role of hope for religious patients because it increases the positive effects of religion in coping with cancer.</docText>

        <docText>A phase II trial of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) as preoperative treatment in women with stage II/III breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Capecitabine (X) and docetaxel (T) have demonstrated a synergistic effect in preclinical models and a survival benefit in metastatic breast cancer. This study's purpose was to determine the efficacy of X and T followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) in the preoperative setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage II/III breast cancer received four cycles of XT (capecitabine 1650 mg/m(2) on days 1-14 and docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) on day 8 every 3 weeks), followed by four cycles of FEC (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks). Primary end points were the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled and 71 patients were assessable for clinical and pathological responses. The overall response rate was 91.5%. The pCR rate was 14.1% (10 of 71). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 32.4% of patients. The most common grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse event was hand-foot syndrome, observed in 11.3% of patients. With 29 months median follow-up, 2-year disease-free survival was estimated 85% for all patients. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the sequential combination of XT followed by FEC is a well-tolerated, effective neoadjuvant treatment of stage II/III breast cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Curcumin analog cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells: exploitation of a redox-dependent mechanism.

A series of novel curcumin analogs, symmetrical dienones, were previously shown to possess cytotoxic, anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities. Analogs 1 (EF24) and 2 (EF31) share the dienone scaffold and serve as Michael acceptors. We propose that the anti-cancer effects of 1 and 2 are mediated in part by redox-mediated induction of apoptosis. In order to support this concept, 1 and 2 were treated with L-glutathione (GSH) and cysteine-containing dipeptides under mild conditions to form colorless water-soluble adducts, which were identified by LC/MS. Comparison of the cytotoxic action of 1, 2 and the corresponding conjugates, 1-(GSH)(2) and 2-(GSH)(2), illustrated that the two classes of compounds exhibit essentially identical cell killing capabilities. Compared with the yellow, somewhat light sensitive and nearly water insoluble compounds 1 and 2, the glutathione conjugates represent a promising new series of stable and soluble anti-tumor pro-drugs.</docText>

        <docText>The impact of a multimedia informational intervention on psychosocial adjustment among individuals with newly diagnosed breast or prostate cancer: A feasibility study.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of an 8-week cancer multimedia informational intervention on health-related outcomes among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer. METHODS: Using a pre-/post-quasi-experimental design, participants with breast or prostate cancer (n=250) were conveniently recruited from four oncology ambulatory clinics and completed questionnaires at three points (enrolment, 1-2 weeks post-intervention, and 3 months later). RESULTS: Repeated-measure analyses showed that, when compared to controls, the intervention significantly improved satisfaction with cancer information over time for women (p&lt;.001), prevented deterioration in functional quality of life (p=.030) and marginally improved perceived oncologist informational support (p=.051). There were no significant differences in psychosocial adjustment among men. Unlike previously suggested, the intervention did not have a differential impact according to levels of personal resources (self-esteem, mastery, and optimism). However, for all outcomes and regardless of group, participants high in personal resources reported better adjustment across time. CONCLUSION: Even though the hypotheses were only partially supported, the findings provide preliminary evidence that multimedia interventions can be supportive. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: With increasing numbers of new cancer diagnoses, cancer survivors and more limited health care resources, further research is needed to evaluate potential benefits of health information technology in providing support to individuals facing cancer.</docText>

        <docText>Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a consensus among breast surgeons?

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this survey was to ascertain the most common surgical practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients desiring breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer to see if a consensus exists for optimal treatment of patients. STUDY DESIGN: We sent a survey to 1,000 surgeons interested in the treatment of breast cancer. Three hundred eighty-one surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response rate of 38%). RESULTS: Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among breast surgeons across the country. There was little intraoperative margin analysis; only 48% of surgeons examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and even fewer used frozen sections or imprint cytology. Decisions to reexcise specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.</docText>

        <docTitle>Timing of breast cancer treatments with oocyte retrieval and embryo cryopreservation.</docTitle>
        <docText>Timing of breast cancer treatments with oocyte retrieval and embryo cryopreservation.

BACKGROUND: Protecting future childbearing motivates young women with breast cancer to seek oocyte or embryo cryopreservation. Concerns about delays in cancer treatment may influence patients and practitioners considering these procedures. In this study, we compared timing of chemotherapy in women who underwent ovarian stimulation/oocyte retrieval (OR) and embryo cryopreservation with those who did not. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-two women younger than 40 years of age, who received adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, were retrospectively identified. Nineteen underwent OR and 63 did not (CON). The timing of OR, surgery, and chemotherapy were compared with the time intervals between diagnosis and treatments in the CON group. RESULTS: The mean ages of women were 33.7 years (OR group) and 35.2 years (CON group); 84.2% of OR and 25.4% of CON were nulliparous. The median time from initial diagnosis to reproductive endocrinology consultation was 30.1 days (range 4 to 133 days) and from referral to OR was 32 days (range 13 to 66 days). The median times from initial diagnosis to chemotherapy in OR versus CON groups were 71 days (range 45 to 161 days) and 67 days (range 27 to 144 days), respectively, p &lt; 0.27. The median time interval from definitive operation to chemotherapy was similar in the two groups: 30 days (OR; range 14 to 100 days) and 29 days (CON; range 12 to 120 days), p &lt; 0.79. CONCLUSIONS: Fertility preservation is an important component of quality of life for young women with breast cancer. The time investment required for OR and cryopreservation is manageable and does not significantly prolong the time interval from diagnosis to start of adjuvant chemotherapy.</docText>

        <docTitle>The TRAIL to targeted therapy of breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>The TRAIL to targeted therapy of breast cancer.

Breast cancers can be classified into those which express the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, those with HER-2 amplification, and those without expression of ER, PR, or amplified HER-2 (referred to as triple-negative or basal-like breast cancer). Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) activates apoptosis upon binding to its receptors in many tumor types and the ligand and agonist antibodies are currently being studied in patients in clinical phases I and II trials. Cell line studies suggest that many breast cancer cell lines are very resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, recent data suggest that a subset of triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cells is sensitive to TRAIL as a single agent. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells can be overcome by combinations of TRAIL with chemotherapy, radiation, and various targeted agents. This chapter will discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms, which control TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The preclinical data supporting the use of TRAIL ligands and agonistic antibodies alone and in combination in breast cancer will also be discussed.</docText>

        <docText>Integrated genomics of chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer: A role for extracellular matrix, TGFbeta and regulating microRNAs.

Epithelial ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and the most important cause of death from gynaecological cancers in the Western world. Our explorative pathway analysis on seven published gene-sets associated with platinum resistance in ovarian cancer reveals TP53 and transforming growth factor beta as key genes. Furthermore, the extracellular matrix was associated with chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer as well as endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Pathway analysis again revealed transforming growth factor beta as a key gene regulating extracellular matrix gene expression. A model is presented based on literature linking transforming growth factor beta, extracellular matrix, integrin signalling, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and regulating microRNAs with a (bivalent) role in chemotherapy response.</docText>

        <docText>Preliminary results with accelerated partial breast irradiation in high-risk breast cancer patients.

PURPOSE: To analyze prognostic factors in adequately staged breast cancer patients who were treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Axillary staging was required for invasive carcinomas. Between February 2003 and June 2009, 204 women with early stage breast carcinomas were treated with APBI using multicatheter, MammoSite, or Contura brachytherapy to 34Gy in 10 fractions 2 times per day. Six patient characteristics were examined for prognostic significance: (1) N stage, (2) estrogen receptor (ER) status, (3) histologic subtype, (4) margin status, (5) age, and (6) tumor size. The median followup was 22 months. RESULTS: There were three failures in the ipsilateral breast (all were elsewhere failures), one relapse in the axilla, and seven relapses at any site. The presence of positive axillary node(s) had a significant adverse effect on ipsilateral breast tumor control (p=0.045) and locoregional control (p=0.001). The presence of an ER (-) tumor had a significant adverse effect on relapse-free survival (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The patients with positive axillary node(s) were at increased risk for failure elsewhere in the ipsilateral breast or axilla, and the patients with ER (-) tumors were at increased risk for relapse at any site. However, it is unclear whether the pN1 and ER (-) patients would have faired any better if they had received whole breast irradiation rather than APBI. We believe that the patients with positive axillary node(s) or ER (-) tumors should be treated on clinical trials to better define the role of APBI.</docText>

        <docText>Prescribers' attitudes toward elderly breast cancer patients. Discrimination or empathy?

Advancing age is often associated with co-morbidities. Patients' chronological and physiological ages do not always correspond. Elderly patients are often excluded from clinical trials and given sub-optimum treatment. In this context, the question of equity in access to health care arises. A specially designed questionnaire was mailed to French oncologists to determine what factors influenced them and to elicit their medical practice using four clinical cases. Significant differences in treatment choice depending only on patient's age were observed. The likelihood of an elderly breast cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy was found to depend on physician specialty and gender, kind of care structure, physician's perception of the age at which patients become elderly, and their knowledge about geriatric assessments. Some physicians did not always prescribe potentially beneficial treatments when dealing with elderly patients. Given the multidimensional nature of the care process, patients' preferences should be taken into account in medical decision-making.</docText>

A series of COX-2 selective inhibitor nimesulide derivatives were synthesized. Their anti-cell proliferation activities were evaluated with a long-term estrogen deprived MCF-7aro (LTEDaro) breast cancer cell line, which is the biological model of aromatase inhibitor resistance for hormone-dependent breast cancer. Compared to nimesulide which inhibited LTEDaro cell proliferation with an IC(50) at 170.30 microM, several new compounds showed IC(50) close to 1.0 microM.</docText>

        <docText>Health problems and retirement due to ill-health among Australian retirees aged 45-64 years.

OBJECTIVE: To examine which health problems are associated with retirement due to ill-health among Australians aged 45-64 years. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of self-reported data of 1933 retired men and 3160 retired women aged 45 and over, living in NSW in 2008, who took part in the 45 and Up Study. Main outcome measure: retirement due to ill-health versus retirement for other reasons. RESULTS: Among retired women, those who reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had thrombosis, depression, osteoarthritis or cancer (except melanoma and skin and breast cancer), were twice as likely to have retired early due to ill-health as those without these health problems. The number of health problems associated with early retirement due to ill-health appeared to be slightly greater for men than for women. From most to least significant stroke, cancer (except melanoma and skin and prostate cancer), osteoarthritis, depression, anxiety and heart disease had significant associations with early retirement. In men and women, the strongest association with retirement due to ill-health was in self-reported health status. CONCLUSION: Legislators, decision-makers, and health policymakers should be aware that several health problems are associated with early retirement due to ill-health among men and women aged 45-64 years. Interventions to prevent or treat these health problems would not only bring immediate health gains to the individuals themselves but would increase their ability to participate in the workforce and/or be otherwise productive in society. Interventions would need to be tailored for men and women separately, given the gender differences in disease profiles and social roles.</docText>

        <docText>Mechanism of lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization of breast cancer cells is primarily by inhibition of the Raf&gt;MEK&gt;ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and radiosensitization of lapatinib-resistant cells restored by direct inhibition of MEK.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We recently showed that lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, radiosensitized breast cancer cells of the basal and HER2+ subtypes. The purpose of this study was to identify the downstream signaling pathways responsible for lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization in breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Response of EGFR downstream signaling pathways was assessed by Western blot and clonogenic cell survival assays in breast tumor cells after irradiation (5Gy), lapatinib, CI-1040, or combined treatment. RESULTS: In SUM102 cells, an EGFR+ basal breast cancer cell line, exposure to ionizing radiation elicited strong activation of ERK1/2 and JNK, which was blocked by lapatinib, and weak/no activation of p38, AKT or STAT3. Direct inhibition of MEK1 with CI-1040 resulted in 95% inhibition of surviving colonies when combined with radiation while inhibition of JNK with SP600125 had no effect. Lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization of SUM102 cells was completely abrogated with expression of constitutively active Raf. Treatment of lapatinib-resistant SUM185 cells with CI-1040 restored radiosensitization with 45% fewer surviving colonies when combined with radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that radiosensitization by lapatinib is mediated largely through inhibition of MEK/ERK and that direct inhibition of this pathway may provide an additional avenue of radiosensitization in EGFR+ or HER2+ breast cancers.</docText>

        <docText>The effect of risedronate on hip structural geometry in chemotherapy-induced postmenopausal women on SERMs versus aromatase inhibitors: A 2-year trial.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a major health problem for postmenopausal women. Adjuvant hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in postmenopausal breast cancer patients further worsens bone loss. Bisphosphonates are able to prevent AI-induced bone loss, but limited data exists on their effect on bone structure. Our objectives were to (1) examine the impact of AIs and non-AIs on hip structural geometry (HSA) of chemotherapy-induced postmenopausal women, and (2) determine if oral bisphosphonates could affect these changes. METHODS: This is a sub-analysis of a 2-year double-blind randomized trial of 67 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer, newly menopausal following chemotherapy (up to 8 years), who were randomized to risedronate, 35 mg once weekly (RIS) and placebo (PBO). Many women changed their cancer therapy from a non-AI to an AI during the trial. Outcomes were changes in Beck's HSA-derived BMD and structural parameters. RESULTS: Eighteen women did not receive adjuvant hormone therapy, while 41 women received other therapy and 8 received AIs at baseline distributed similarly between RIS and PBO. Women on AIs and PBO were found to have the lowest BMD and indices. RIS improved BMD and several HSA indices at the intertrochanteric site in women regardless of their hormonal therapy, but most improvement was observed in women who were not on AIs (all p&lt;/=0.05 except buckling ratio). Changes at the narrow neck and femoral shaft were similar. CONCLUSION: The use of AIs appears to lead to lower HSA-derived BMD and hip structural indices as compared to women on no or non-AI therapy in chemotherapy-induced postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Preventive therapy with once weekly oral risedronate maintains structural, skeletal integrity independently of the use of or type of adjuvant therapy.</docText>

        <docText>Matriptase/epithin participates in mammary epithelial cell growth and morphogenesis through HGF activation.

The epithelial-derived, type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase, the mouse homologue of which is epithin, has been shown to be involved in epidermal differentiation, hair formation, and thymus function. We show in this study that epithin/matriptase (Epi/MTP) plays a significant role in mammary epithelial cell growth and morphogenesis. Epi/MTP is expressed at low level in the mouse mammary epithelium of young animals and it accumulates at the terminal end-bud of the growing ducts. The level of Epi/MTP is elevated in the mammary glands at stages when epithelial proliferation and modeling occur. It is primarily present in the luminal epithelial cells of mouse mammary ducts and lobules. Using an ex vivo three-dimensional culture system for mammary epithelial functional assays, we show that mammary epithelial growth and morphogenesis in the presence of the latent form hepatocyte growth factor (pro-HGF) are blocked either by an inhibitor of the Epi/MTP protease activity or by siRNA knockdown of the Epi/MTP expression. These studies demonstrate that Epi/MTP participates in mammary epithelial growth and modeling through activation of pro-HGF. Our findings reveal an important pathway in normal mammary epithelial morphogenesis which may participate in breast cancer progression.</docText>

        <docTitle>Cancer pattern and survival in a rural district in South India.</docTitle>
        <docText>Cancer pattern and survival in a rural district in South India.

Background: Cancer pattern data are rare and survival data are none from rural districts of India. Methods: The Dindigul Ambilikkai Cancer Registry (DACR) covering rural population of 2 millions in Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu state, South India, registered 4516 incident cancers during 2003-2006 by active case finding from 102 data sources for studying incidence pattern, of which, 1045 incident cancers registered in 2003 were followed up for estimating survival. House visits were undertaken annually for each registered case for data completion. Cancer pattern was described using average annual incidence rates and survival experience was expressed by computing observed survival by actuarial method and age-standardized relative survival (ASRS). Results: The average annual age-standardized rate per 100,000 of all cancers together was higher among women (62.6) than men (51.9) in DACR. The most common cancers among men were stomach (5.6), mouth (4.2) and esophagus (3.7). Cervical cancer (22.1) was ranked at the top among women followed by breast (10.9) and ovary (3.3). DACR incidence rates were lesser by at least two folds and 5-year survival were on par or lower than Chennai metropolitan registry for most cancers. Five-year age-standardized relative survival (%) in DACR was as follows: all cancers (29%), larynx (48), mouth (42), breast/tongue (38) and cervix (37). Conclusion: Cancer incidence was significantly lower, cancer patterns were markedly different and population-based cancer survival was lower in rural areas than urban areas thus providing valuable leads in estimating realistic cancer burden and instituting cancer control programs in India.</docText>

        <docText>Intraoperative placement of MammoSite for breast brachytherapy treatment and seroma incidence.

PURPOSE: To identify possible risk factors for development of clinically significant seroma (CSS) (seroma requiring intervention) and to report on incidence of infection after intraoperative placement of MammoSite for breast brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-eight postmenopausal patients with early stage breast cancer and no nodal metastases, treated with partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite catheter from June 2003 to November 2007 were analyzed retrospectively for CSS predictive factors and incidence of infection. After a lumpectomy, a MammoSite catheter was placed by intraoperative open-cavity technique (OCT). All the patients received wound care and prophylactic antibiotics. A dose of 3400cGy was prescribed at 1cm from the surface of the balloon and was delivered at 340 cGy twice daily 6h apart for 5 days. The patients with seroma who underwent intervention were considered to have CSS. On the basis of the characteristics and symptoms associated with seroma, interventions, such as aspiration, core biopsy, or re-excision of the lumpectomy cavity were performed either to relieve symptoms or to rule out a local recurrence. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of the 58 patients were eligible for analysis. One patient, who died 4 weeks after treatment from unrelated causes, was excluded from final analysis. All the patients were postmenopausal, with a median age of 71 years (range, 53-88 years). Eighteen of the 57 patients (31.5%) had CSS; 9 of them had re-excision of the lumpectomy cavity. Pathology in all revealed evidence of fat necrosis, chronic inflammatory cells, and fibrosis. There was no evidence of tumor recurrence in any of these patients. Technical and nontechnical parameters were analyzed to determine possible risk factors for CSS, and none were found to be statistically significant. No patient developed acute postprocedural infection. CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous wound care and postoperative antibiotics prevented acute infection. Infection was not a contributing factor for seroma formation in these patients. Placement of the MammoSite catheter by OCT did not increase the risk of CSS development, in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.</docText>

        <docText>A case of ectopic breast cancer with a literature review.

A 63-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a right axillary nodule in 2004. Physical examination showed a spherical nodule measuring 0.5cm in diameter in the right axilla. No mass was palpable in either breast. Mammograms were normal. Ultrasonography revealed a subcutaneous hypoechoic mass 0.7mm in maximum diameter in the right axilla. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy. Histological examination revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma (scirrhous carcinoma) in ectopic breast tissue. The patient subsequently underwent a wide local excision of the tissue surrounding the biopsy scar, with axillary lymph node dissection. Histologically, no residual tumor or nodal metastasis was found. Postoperatively, she received endocrine therapy and remains well, without any evidence of recurrence 4years 10months after operation. Cancer of the ectopic breast tissue is rare, and most cases present as a solitary axillary mass. Long-term outcomes remain unclear. We present a case of breast carcinoma in the axillary ectopic mammary gland and summarize the clinical features of 94 cases, including ours, in Japan. We also compare long-term survival between ectopic breast cancer and usual breast cancer according to TNM T stage and lymph node metastasis.</docText>

        <docText>Atypical epithelial hyperplasia of the breast: Current state of knowledge and clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of atypical epithelial hyperplasia (AEH) increases with breast cancer screening. AEH is divided in three groups: atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell lesions with atypia, lobular neoplasia. The management of women with AEH is not consensual because of uncertainty about their diagnosis related to the type of the biopsy sampling (core needle biopsy or surgical excision) and their controversial clinical signification between risk marker and true precursor of breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of published studies was performed. Medline baseline interrogation was performed with the following keywords: atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell lesions with atypia, lobular neoplasia, core needle biopsy, breast cancer, precursor lesion, hormonal replacement therapy. For each breast lesion, identified publications (English or French) were assessed for clinical practise in epidemiology, diagnosis and patient management. RESULTS: With immunohistochemistry and molecular studies, AEH seems to be precursor of breast cancer. But, epidemiological studies show low rate of breast cancer in women with AEH. AEH were still classified as risk factor of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Because of high rate of breast cancer underestimation, surgical excision is necessary after the diagnosis of AEH at core needle biopsy. Surgical oncology rules and collaboration with radiologist are required for this surgery. A second operation was not required due to involved margins by AEH (except with pleiomorphic lobular neoplasia) because local control of breast cancer seems to be unchanged. Besides, hormonal replacement therapy for patient with AEH is not recommended because of lack of studies about this subject.</docText>

        <docTitle>Biliary efflux transporters involved in the clearance of rosuvastatin in sandwich culture of primary rat hepatocytes.</docTitle>
        <docText>Biliary efflux transporters involved in the clearance of rosuvastatin in sandwich culture of primary rat hepatocytes.

Rosuvastatin (a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) has been shown to be excreted mostly unchanged into the bile; interactions on the level of hepatic apical efflux transporters may represent a risk of liver toxicity. So far, controversial and insufficient data are available concerning transporters involved in the elimination process. This study was designed to elucidate, which transporters take part in the biliary clearance of rosuvastatin using sandwich-cultured primary rat hepatocytes. The canalicular efflux of rosuvastatin was measured in the presence of inhibitors: Ko 134, mitoxanthrone, novobiocin for breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp); verapamil for multidrug resistance protein (Mdr1); benzbromarone, sulfasalazine, probenecid for multidrug resistance associated protein (Mrp 2); and cyclosporine A, glibenclamide, troglitazone for bile salt export pump (Bsep). Mrp2 inhibitors decreased the biliary efflux of rosuvastatin most potently by 78.9%, 35%, 54.1%; benzbromarone, probenecid, sulfasalazine, respectively, while Bcrp and Bsep inhibitors showed much less effect (29.1%, 23.0% ,30.0%; Ko 134, mitoxanthrone, novobiocin, respectively, and 32.6%, 29.3%, 20.6%, glibenclamide, cyclosporine A, troglitazone, respectively). The marked decline of canalicular transport by Mrp2 inhibitors suggests major role of Mrp2 in this process; however, Bcrp and Bsep might also contribute to the biliary elimination of rosuvatatin in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes.</docText>

        <docText>Zip6-attenuation promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ductal breast tumor (T47D) cells.

Breast cancer is associated with zinc (Zn) hyper-accumulation in breast tissue which is postulated to be potentiated by the over-expression of Zn importing proteins. Zip6 (LIV-1) over-expression has been documented in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast tumors. Anti-estrogens, such as fulvestrant, are typically prescribed for ER+ breast cancer and thus may play a role in modulating cellular Zn hyper-accumulation. Herein, we investigated the physiological relevance of Zip6 over-expression and the consequences of Zip6-attenuation in breast tumor cells as a mechanism in the development of anti-estrogen resistance. We documented that over-expression of Zip6 was associated with significantly higher cellular Zn levels in tumor cells compared with normal breast cells. Fulvestrant significantly reduced Zn accumulation in tumor cells, without robust effects on Zip6 protein abundance. Zip6-attenuation significantly reduced cellular Zn pools, which was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and decreased apoptotic stimuli (cytoplasmic cytochrome C release, caspase-3 and -9 activities). Importantly, decreased apoptosis significantly increased tumor colony formation in soft agar and was associated with reduced E-cadherin expression. Our data suggest that anti-estrogen treatment regulates Zn level and importantly verify that Zip6 over-expression is not an underlying mechanism initiating breast cancer, but in fact may play a "tumor-constraining" role.</docText>

        <docTitle>Predictive factors for breast cancer in patients diagnosed atypical ductal hyperplasia at core needle biopsy.</docTitle>
        <docText>Predictive factors for breast cancer in patients diagnosed atypical ductal hyperplasia at core needle biopsy.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous core needle biopsy (CNB) is considered to be the standard technique for histological diagnosis of breast lesions. But, it is less reliable for diagnosing atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). The purpose of the present study was to predict, based on clinical and radiological findings, which cases of ADH diagnosed by CNB would be more likely to be associated with a more advanced lesion on subsequent surgical excision. METHODS: Between February 2002 and December 2007, consecutive ultrasound-guided CNBs were performed on suspicious breast lesions at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. A total of 69 CNBs led to a diagnosis of ADH, and 45 patients underwent follow-up surgical excision. We reviewed the medical records and analyses retrospectively. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were diagnosed with ADH at CNB. Of these patients, 45 underwent surgical excision and 10 (22.2%) were subsequently diagnosed with a malignancy (ductal carcinoma in situ, n = 8; invasive cancer, n = 2). Univariate analysis revealed age (&gt;or= 50-years) at the time of core needle biopsy (p = 0.006), size (&gt; 10 mm) on imaging (p = 0.033), and combined mass with microcalcification on sonography (p = 0.029) to be associated with underestimation. When those three factors were included in multivariate analysis, only age (p = 0.035, HR 6.201, 95% CI 1.135-33.891) was an independent predictor of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Age (&gt;or= 50) at the time of biopsy is an independent predictive factor for breast cancer at surgical excision in patients with diagnosed ADH at CNB. For patients diagnosed with ADH at CNB, only complete surgical excision is the suitable treatment option, because we could not find any combination of factors that can safely predict the absence of DCIS or invasive cancer in a case of ADH.</docText>

        <docTitle>Dietary patterns, risk and prognosis of breast cancer.</docTitle>
        <docText>Dietary patterns, risk and prognosis of breast cancer.

Survival in women diagnosed with early-stage, invasive breast cancer has improved dramatically in the past 10-15 years. This is largely due to the use of pharmacological therapies targeting a reduction in estrogen action and exposure. Women diagnosed with breast cancer often alter their eating behavior towards healthier food choices in an attempt to improve their survival and their overall health and well being. Mounting interest in the role of diet to modify breast cancer survival and/or comorbidity and mortality has led researchers to evaluate the effects of differential dietary patterns on this disease. Current findings suggest a possible, but inconsistent, benefit of a prudent, vegetable-rich, low-fat/high-vegetable eating pattern on disease-free survival, but the results to date are limited by strong treatment effectiveness and low overall recurrence rates. It is more likely this prudent eating pattern will improve non-breast cancer mortality (e.g., cardiovascular disease) compared with a Western dietary pattern. Efforts to educate women diagnosed with breast cancer to consume a diet lower in total and saturated fat, higher in vegetables and fiber, and which results in mild to modest weight loss among overweight/obese women is sensible in light of the high survivability of breast cancer and need to direct attention to comorbidities that likely increase as a consequence of treatment and treatment-related weight gain and sedentary behavior. Additional research is needed to address the importance of diet in the breast cancer patient, particularly in relation to the effect of select dietary patterns on factors that influence individual recurrence risk (e.g., hormone levels, drug metabolism and oxidative stress), as well as factors that influence non-breast cancer morbidity risk and causes of death in the survivor population.</docText>

        <docText>DNA methylation as a biomarker in breast cancer.

In cancer, epigenetic changes such as covalent addition of methyl groups to the genomic DNA itself are more prominent than genetic changes. Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) methylation negatively affects gene transcription of an adjacent gene. It is thought that DNA methylation significantly contributes to all hallmarks of cancer. Next to being a potential therapy target, DNA methylation is an emerging field of biomarkers. Technically, DNA provides a stable and robust analyte that is particularly suitable for clinical applications. Moreover, there are numerous potential human DNA sources that could facilitate integration of methylation tests in clinical practice. In breast cancer, DNA methylation has shown promise as a potential biomarker for early detection, therapy monitoring, assessment of prognosis or prediction of therapy response. In particular, paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) DNA methylation has been validated using a robust assay for paraffin-embedded tissue for clinically relevant outcome prediction in early breast cancer patients treated by adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.</docText>

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition tumorigenesis in the mouse has been described for over 100 years using various terms and with little comprehension of the underlying mechanisms. Recently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition tumors have been recognized in mammary glands of genetically engineered mice. This review provides a historical perspective and the current observations in the context of some of the key molecular biology. The biology of mouse mammary epithelial-mesenchymal transition tumorigenesis is discussed with comparisons to human breast cancer.</docText>

        <docTitle>Identification of functionally related genes using data mining and data integration: a breast cancer case study.</docTitle>
        <docText>Identification of functionally related genes using data mining and data integration: a breast cancer case study.

BACKGROUND : The identification of the organisation and dynamics of molecular pathways is crucial for the understanding of cell function. In order to reconstruct the molecular pathways in which a gene of interest is involved in regulating a cell, it is important to identify the set of genes to which it interacts with to determine cell function. In this context, the mining and the integration of a large amount of publicly available data, regarding the transcriptome and the proteome states of a cell, are a useful resource to complement biological research. RESULTS : We describe an approach for the identification of genes that interact with each other to regulate cell function. The strategy relies on the analysis of gene expression profile similarity, considering large datasets of expression data. During the similarity evaluation, the methodology determines the most significant subset of samples in which the evaluated genes are highly correlated. Hence, the strategy enables the exclusion of samples that are not relevant for each gene pair analysed. This feature is important when considering a large set of samples characterised by heterogeneous experimental conditions where different pools of biological processes can be active across the samples. The putative partners of the studied gene are then further characterised, analysing the distribution of the Gene Ontology terms and integrating the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. The strategy was applied for the analysis of the functional relationships of a gene of known function, Pyruvate Kinase, and for the prediction of functional partners of the human transcription factor TBX3. In both cases the analysis was done on a dataset composed by breast primary tumour expression data derived from the literature. Integration and analysis of PPI data confirmed the prediction of the methodology, since the genes identified to be functionally related were associated to proteins close in the PPI network. Two genes among the predicted putative partners of TBX3 (GLI3 and GATA3) were confirmed by in vivo binding assays (crosslinking immunoprecipitation, X-ChIP) in which the putative DNA enhancer sequence sites of GATA3 and GLI3 were found to be bound by the Tbx3 protein. CONCLUSION : The presented strategy is demonstrated to be an effective approach to identify genes that establish functional relationships. The methodology identifies and characterises genes with a similar expression profile, through data mining and integrating data from publicly available resources, to contribute to a better understanding of gene regulation and cell function.

        <docText>Conditional independence relations among biological markers may improve clinical decision as in the case of triple negative breast cancers.

The associations existing among different biomarkers are important in clinical settings because they contribute to the characterisation of specific pathways related to the natural history of the disease, genetic and environmental determinants. Despite the availability of binary/linear (or at least monotonic) correlation indices, the full exploitation of molecular information depends on the knowledge of direct/indirect conditional independence (and eventually causal) relationships among biomarkers, and with target variables in the population of interest. In other words, that depends on inferences which are performed on the joint multivariate distribution of markers and target variables. Graphical models, such as Bayesian Networks, are well suited to this purpose. Therefore, we reconsidered a previously published case study on classical biomarkers in breast cancer, namely estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), a proliferative index (Ki67/MIB-1) and to protein HER2/neu (NEU) and p53, to infer conditional independence relations existing in the joint distribution by inferring (learning) the structure of graphs entailing those relations of independence. We also examined the conditional distribution of a special molecular phenotype, called triple-negative, in which ER, PR and NEU were absent. We confirmed that ER is a key marker and we found that it was able to define subpopulations of patients characterized by different conditional independence relations among biomarkers. We also found a preliminary evidence that, given a triple-negative profile, the distribution of p53 protein is mostly supported in 'zero' and 'high' states providing useful information in selecting patients that could benefit from an adjuvant anthracyclines/alkylating agent-based chemotherapy.</docText>

        <docText>Survival Online: a web-based service for the analysis of correlations between gene expression and clinical and follow-up data.

BACKGROUND : Complex microarray gene expression datasets can be used for many independent analyses and are particularly interesting for the validation of potential biomarkers and multi-gene classifiers. This article presents a novel method to perform correlations between microarray gene expression data and clinico-pathological data through a combination of available and newly developed processing tools. RESULTS : We developed Survival Online (available at http://ada.dist.unige.it:8080/enginframe/bioinf/bioinf.xml), a Web-based system that allows for the analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays by using a parallel version of dChip. The user is first enabled to select pre-loaded datasets or single samples thereof, as well as single genes or lists of genes. Expression values of selected genes are then correlated with sample annotation data by uni- or multi-variate Cox regression and survival analyses. The system was tested using publicly available breast cancer datasets and GO (Gene Ontology) derived gene lists or single genes for survival analyses. CONCLUSION : The system can be used by bio-medical researchers without specific computation skills to validate potential biomarkers or multi-gene classifiers. The design of the service, the parallelization of pre-processing tasks and the implementation on an HPC (High Performance Computing) environment make this system a useful tool for validation on several independent datasets.</docText>

        <docText>The Journal of Pathology 2008 Jeremy Jass Prize for Research Excellence in Pathology.

The first Jass Prize for Research Excellence has been awarded to a group from Hannover in Germany. These authors discovered the epigenetic inactivation of microRNA gene hsa-mir-9-1 in human breast cancer and characterized its biological and clinical relevance. This frequent epigenetic silencing was found to occur early in the development of breast cancer, and illustrates another mechanism by which tumour development is influenced by genes that operate without expression as proteins.</docText>
