MANHATTAN - The prairie dog, African hedgehog and the Chinchilla, are among today's top fad pets, said Oregon State University exotic animal veterinarian Dr. Ted Parmentier. "Fad" exotic pets, such as the pot-bellied pig of the mid-1990s, are defined as uncommon pets that suddenly become popular. However, some fad pets can be challenging to care for, and potential owners need to be careful before buying into the animal's popularity. Parmentier said prospective owners should be well informed about the pet's needs.

No one should get a fad pet simply because it is "cool," Parmentier said. They may not realize how difficult or complicated proper care can be.

"They might acquire a tiger cub, not realizing that it may weigh over 400 pounds when fully grown and be expensive to care for, as well as dangerous," Parmentier said. "Others may purchase a small constrictor (such as a young Burmese python), not knowing that some species grow to be 16 to 18 feet -- or more -- in length."

The chinchilla, one of the "fad" pets of the moment, will select a diet far too rich for him. They love pizza crust, cheetos, raisins, apples and the like. However these items given more than occasionally will soon lead to digestive upsets and loose stools. These upsets can be fatal.

Diet-related ailments are common among fad pets because owners don't know the nutrients animals need, Parmentier said. For instance, a common medical problem among sugar gliders is sudden hind-leg paralysis, which is caused by calcium and vitamin deficiencies.

Pet-shop puppies might lack credentials 
05/28/03

My friend learned the hard way. Beware of pet-shop puppies if you compete in 
American Kennel Club obedience or agility trials. 
Several of my friend's dogs have earned advanced AKC obedience titles. 
However, a pet-shop puppy might not be eligible for AKC registration. 
    
            
When my friend went to a pet shop recently to buy dog food, she fell in love 
with a puppy of the same breed that she shows in obedience trials. When the 
pup was still at the shop one month later, she bought him. 
She assumed the pup was eligible for AKC registration. The clerk said she 
would receive the pup's registration in a month to 90 days. She should have 
received the litter registration form at the time she took possession of the dog. 
A few days later, my friend realized the dog's pedigree stated that his 
parents were registered with America's Pet Registry. 
To be eligible for AKC registration, a dog's parents must be AKC-registered. 
When AKC began requiring DNA testing as proof of lineage of dogs that have 
sired more than three litters in a year or seven litters in a lifetime, many 
puppy millers and puppy distributors started their own registries rather than 
comply with the AKC rule. There are more than 15 canine regis tries. 
Many of these regis tries offer nothing more than a slip of pa per saying 
that the dog is registered. Some even encourage giving "breed" names to 
mixed-breed puppies as a ploy for selling them at higher prices, to buyers who think 
"registered" is more valuable than a mixed breed. 
My friend will never be able to contact the breeder if she has questions 
about the dog's heritage or genetic problems. The breeder's address at America's 
Pet Registry is kept secret from the purchaser. In the case of an AKC dog, the 
breeder, who is also the seller, often becomes a mentor and friend for life. 
However, purebred dogs that are not eligible for AKC registration may compete 
in AKC obedience, agility and other performance events if they have an 
Indefinite Listing Privilege, more commonly known as ILP. AKC does not permit ILP 
dogs to be shown in conformation, a competition based on the dog's resemblance 
to its breed standard. 
To obtain an ILP, the dog must be a breed that is recognized by AKC. The 
owner is required to send two color photos of the dog to the AKC along with a 
completed application form and proof from a veterinarian that the dog has been 
spayed or neutered. Cost is $25. 
AKC's requirement for spaying or neutering prevents owners from continuing a 
line of unregisterable dogs. 
Conformation competition is not an issue here because anyone who is looking 
for a dog to compete in AKC shows would not consider a pet shop as a source. 
Puppy-mill puppies, which supply pet shops, are cranked out as rapidly as 
possible to meet demand. No consideration is given to carefully selecting a dam and 
sire so that the offspring will resemble, as closely as possible, the breed's 
standard of perfection. 
Nor is it likely that any puppy-mill dams and sires are tested for genetic 
diseases, such as hip dysplasia or progressive retinal atrophy, which should 
eliminate them from a breeding program. Responsible breeders do test, and this 
should be an issue for any buyer whether the interest is in pet, show or 
performance events. 
Two things have resulted from my friend's experience. She will give the puppy 
a good, permanent home for life. And she is wiser about pet shops.

On Friday 23rd May, the 2 adolescent female gorillas "Brighter" and "Twigs" 
were repatriated to Cameroon from
Nigeria where they had lived for many years as pets in the northern 
metropolis of Kano. I'm sure you've all heard
the story by now, but the gorillas were purchased as infants by a Lebanese 
businessman who saw them in the market
and felt pity for them. He tried unsuccessfully several times to find 
permanent homes for them. The gorillas
(ages 6 &amp; 9 yrs) are products of the bush meat trade and are believed to be 
western lowland gorillas (G. g.
gorilla), and not Cross River gorillas (G. g. diehli). They were smuggled, 
in separate incidents, into Nigeria as
infants, to eventually wind up for sale in Kano. In December 2002, they 
were put under house arrest by the federal
Ministry of Environment as a violation of CITES protocols.

After months of trying to coordinate the effort, the NGO Pandrillus was 
able to successfully carry off the
repatriation on Friday. The gorillas were transferred from Mr. Paul Raad's 
compound to Kano International Airport
courtesy of Julius Berger Nigeria. They were flown on domestic carrier 
"IRS" to Lagos early Friday morning with
Pandrillus Director Peter Jenkins, Pandrillus Nigeria Manager Ubi Sam 
Ettah, Alhaji Bindawa of Ministry of
Environment (Kano), and Paul Raad of Kano. "Jam Packed Cargo" of Lagos 
coordinated their transfer to Murtala
Muhammed International Airport terminal, and loading into a Cameroon 
Airlines 757-400 jet for the 70 minute flight
to Douala.

A press conference was held by Environment Minister Dr. Imeh Okopido on the 
tarmac with Brighter and Twigs holding
forth in their travel crates. BBC, AFP and a tremendous turnout from the 
ever-vibrant Nigerian media were on hand.
Also in attendance were Prof. Emmanuel Obot, Acting Director of Nigerian 
Conservation Foundation; Ian Redmond of
GRASP; and Melanie Virtue of UNEP Nairobi. The aircraft departed Lagos at 
1:15 pm and was received in Douala by
Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (MINEF) officials and staff of Limbe 
Wildlife Center. On the ground in Douala the
Provincial Delegate of Littoral Province handled all airport formalities 
for a swift and safe transfer to the Limbe
Wildlife Center.

The gorillas were promptly off-loaded to continue their journey in a MINEF 
truck to their new home in Southwest
Province, where they will join a group of 8 gorillas, ranging in age from 3 
to 13 years, once they complete
quarantine.

The Limbe Wildlife Center is a collaborative effort between MINEF and the 
NGO Pandrillus. LWC is also home to
orphan chimpanzees, drills, mandrills, baboons and 8 other monkey species. 
It was created in 1993. Pandrillus
also established and operates the Drill Rehab &amp; Breeding Center in Cross 
River State, Nigeria. The costs for
Brighter and Twigs repatriation were provided equally by UNEP-GRASP Nairobi 
and the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance
(PASA).

  Elder Abuse and Animal Cruelty 
     
 On January 20, 2001, an anonymous caller to the Washington, D.C. Humane Society reported that her neighbor's daughter had thrown a dead dog into the trash dumpster. Animal control officers arrived at the scene to discover that the dead dog was only the tip of the iceberg. They also found an emaciated and disoriented 90-year-old woman. The floor of the house was covered with trash and dog feces, parts of the ceiling had caved in, and mildew covered the walls. 
Reports indicated that the daughter often left her elderly mother alone for several weeks at a time. The animal control officers rescued the remaining dogs and contacted adult protective services, which arranged to have the woman transported to a hospital. The two agencies coordinated their actions to meet the needs of victims of two different types of abuse?yet all of whom required emergency care. If it hadn't been for the report of a dead dog, the suffering of both human and animal victims would have continued unnoticed. 

Animal cruelty or neglect can often be a warning sign of other forms of abuse, including elder abuse. That's why The HSUS has joined forces with the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging to share information on the animal cruelty/elder abuse connection. We're coordinating our efforts around Older Americans Month, the period set aside each May to honor the country's senior citizens. 

The informational campaign is clearly needed. According to the National Elder Abuse Incidence Study*, "approximately 450,000 elderly persons in domestic settings were abused and/or neglected during 1996." When the cases of elderly self-neglect were added, the numbers rose to more than 550,000. 

What's more, according to the study, ?data show that family members were the perpetrators in nine out of ten (89.7 percent) substantiated incidents of domestic elder abuse and neglect. Adult children of elder abuse victims were the most likely perpetrators of substantiated maltreatment (47.3 percent). Spouses represented the second largest group of perpetrators (19.3 percent)." 

When a family member abuses an elderly relative's pet, the motivations may be complex. The perpetrator may neglect or abuse an elder's pet as a form of control or retaliation, out of frustration over their caretaking responsibilities, or as a way to extract financial assets.

PLEASE HELP US TO CLOSE BRUGE'S DOLPHINARIUM
Source: Y. Van der Bogaert
Dolphins at Bruges : dead or alive !
 
Please help us to ask Mr Jeff Tavernier to close the Bruges' Dolphinarium 
 
sample letter  to minister J. Tavernier  
E-mail: jef.tavernier@minsoc.fed.be 
 
Mr Tavernier,

We ask you to close Bruges? dolphinarium for the following reasons:
Even if dolphins are surviving longer in Bruges than in other places, it changes nothing to the fact it's not a right place for them. To be able to survive so long is just a sign of their huge intelligence, adaptability and love of life.
On the other hand, breeding-in-tank kills a lot of newborn each year and gives birth to some kind of dolphin-zombies. Without culture, without complete social relationships, without sun and fresh air, without seeds, rocks and real salt water, a dolphin is not a dolphin.
He is not able to learn how to hunt in the sea, nor how to speak his own tribe's dialect nor how it feels to swim straight on during hours and hours under the sky in an open sea....
Bruges? dolphinarium is just an animal circus, devoted to "intensive breeding" and solding their dolphins as soon as they're weaned, as totally dominated and tractable "dolphin slaves", performing days after day, weeks after weeks, years after years, until they die too young... 
Millions of European animal lovers will be grateful that this business will be halted in Europe.
Yours Sincerely,

Athens News - Letter to the Editor
 
There are many personal and professional websites that are appearing on the 
internet with figurative fingers pointing disapprovingly at Greece.  The 
testimonials and photos  giving graphic evidence of vicious animal cruelty in Greece 
are spreading steadily.  Cruelty news will, of course, eventually spread via 
the vast internet, which services millions of concerned people,  and to the 
international print and TV media.  
 
As the 2004 Athens Olympic Games loom ahead, the reports of pervasive animal 
abuse in Greece circulate and the ensuing global concern will gather momentum 
and as a consequence, wreak havoc on the  expectations and projected financial 
outcome of the Games.  This tragedy could so easily be avoided if the Greek 
government was truly willing to implement nationwide humane reform.  Greek 
officials disdainfully salute the world with their collective middle finger.
 
To date, government action in relation to  nationwide  vicious cruelty issues 
are in what appear to be a perpetual state of inertia and bureaucratic 
indecision.  Legal humane proposals sit idle before Parliament and the defenseless 
animals are taking the proverbial bullet for inhumanity.  In the interim, tens 
of thousands of innocent, unprotected, forgotten, abandoned animals are 
suffering and dying agonizing deaths via poisoning, hanging and shooting; as well as 
 by starvation and willful neglect.   At the same time billions of dollars 
are being spent on preparation for the Olympic Games infrastructure, airport, 
hotels, a new rail system, hotels, security and not a "drachma" has been spent 
to alleviate the suffering of sentient beings. 
 
This is a moral and social outrage.  When will this end?  The Greek 
government and her people appear to be  keeping this a "state secret".

 PRESS RELEASE (for immediate release)      29 May 2003

 Hong Kong Legislator, Conservation and Welfare Groups
 agree on Resolution for China

 On Wednesday 28th May 2003, during a Discussion Panel
 on Protecting Wild Animals organised by Dr. Hon. Chu
 Yu-lin, J.P, Legislative Councilor and Deputy of
 China's National People's Congress, a unanimous
 resolution was passed concerning the trade and
 consumption of wild animals, together with domestic
 dogs and cats.

 Proposed by the Hong Kong based Animals Asia
 Foundation, the Resolution stated:  "We call for the
 Central Government of China to instruct all provinces
 to emulate the good example in Guangdong, where
 breeding, trading and consumption of wild animals has
 now been banned.  We urge the Central Government to go
 further by closing all wild animals markets
 countrywide, and banning the consumption of wild
 animals, dogs and cats, together with the breeding and
 trading of wild animals, dogs and cats for
 consumption."

 The Resolution, which was unanimously supported by the
 following groups, will now be submitted by Dr. Chu to
 the National People's Congress in Beijing:

 1.  Dr. Hon. Chu Yu-lin J.P., Legislative Councilor
 and Deputy of the National People's Congress
 2.  Animals Asia Foundation
 3.  The Conservancy Association
 4.  Friends of the Earth Hong Kong
 5.  Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden
 6.  Asian Animal Protection Network
 7.  Lamma Animal Protection
 8.  The Hong Kong Bird Watching Society
 9.  World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong
 10. Ocean Park Hong Kong
 11. TRAFFIC East Asia.

 During the meeting, Jill Robinson MBE, Founder and CEO
 of Animals Asia,  stressed the importance of finding
 solutions if the countrywide trade in wild animals,
 together with dogs and cats were to end and pledged
 Animals Asia's help in creating and producing public
 education programmes nationwide.

 Dr. David Chu Yu-lin said:  "Eating cats, dogs and
 wild
 animals is not only uncivilized, but can also
 negatively affect our health.  The Central Government
 should therefore ban such uncivilised behaviour
 through
 legislation."

 Ms Robinson paid tribute to Legislators and officials
 in Hong Kong and China who were spearheading a new era
 of humane education in China:  "The leadership of Dr.
 Chu and government members of the China Wildlife
 Conservation Association in Beijing is undoubtedly
 paving the way towards ending decades of misery and
 disease in the animals markets of China.  For the
 first
 time in nearly twenty years of calling for the closure
 of these cruel and unsanitary markets country wide,
 there is hope."

 Ends.

LAS VEGAS MAKES CONSCIOUS DECISION TO KILL MORE ANIMALS THAN OTHER CITIES IT'S SIZE.  Lives, nor
even the safety of innocent animals fall short of the almighty dollar.

"Oh, Praise Mary Greenspun Almighty"  or so she demands anyway.

TO: The Las Vegas Media Community and Residents
                             (seeking a knowledgeable hard hitting attorney for this case)
 
It's not likely that many of you who live in the Vegas area will ever see this or have a single
idea that this huge scandal exists and is continuing in your community.  WHY?
Because, the person in the very center of stealing your money is the woman who owns both
newspapers and some of the TV stations in Las Vegas. 
 
As in all crime stories, there is a 'boss' and the 'triggerman' or in this case 'trigger woman'.
Janie Greenspun will play the part of the &#x2018;boss&#x2019; here and her &#x2018;trigger woman&#x2019; will be known as
Mary Hero who made her millions from the Animal foundation.
 
These two women are about to launch yet another campaign to raise millions off 
the backs of dying innocent animals through deceitful and highly questionable fundraising
practices they&#x2019;ve made so much money from over the years right under your noses.  It seems as
though using the poor animals to raise funds for their luxurious homes and lifestyles isn&#x2019;t
enough.  Since the mainstream public in Las Vegas has no time to find out the facts, the two women
are now the likely candidate to receive the County&#x2019;s animal control contract in 2005 issued by the
Clarke County Supervisors - yes, the same ones who are under investigation by the FBI on several
illegal dealings and operations they have been involved with, USING YOUR TAX MONEY!!  One would
quickly assume that the entire group is somehow involved in undermining the reputation as well as
the operations of the city. The Clark County board of supervisors is likely to award the contract
for animal control to her in 2005. There are other qualified entities in Clark County who would be
much more suitable for this contract, but until the public realizes that the problems that the
animal facilities face is actually the fault of the community at large, the awarding of this
contract seems to be a given. The county refuses to budget appropriately and nobody receiving this
contract will be able to make the appropriate changes that make the difference until the community
is made aware of who is actually running the majority of the animal orgs and learn to make
necessary changes in their lives as well.  
 
The simple fact that they have spent so much time in pointing fingers and accusing others of so
many  things, proves three things:  1.these two women do NOT hold the safety and welfare of the
animals in the highest esteem and would rather divert the public&#x2019;s attention away from what
isreally going on , 2. they forget what they are &#x2018;supposedly&#x2019; accepting the money to accomplish &#x2013;
as if there just arent&#x2019; enough animals to help, so they use extra time and  money to make this a
competition, and 3. the community is quite unaware that they are being &#x2018;taken&#x2019; in this game they
play.  NOBODY WINS, but the animals really loose. Now, it&#x2019;s not the millions of dollars they&#x2019;ve
made from running the Animal Foundation for so many years. Anyone who can solve these problems in
a community or our nation should be made a billionaire on the spot.  But the animal problems
continue in Clarke County. This type of &#x2018;female&#x2019; bickering  leaves the good people who actually
try to help the animals, to fend for themselves and eat off the bottom of the barrel.  They are
the ones who will really make a difference, but are pushed aside and forced to close.
 
Janie, the &#x2018;boss&#x2019; is known to sue anyone who just might stand up and look as if they may be
pointing a finger at her.  Many even suggest fear of personal injury or harm to themselves, should
they speak out.  One who is actually being the complete opposite of a caring individual is most
appropriate to describe Ms. Greenspun. Finally, one who needs to be exposed and stopped.

The attempted ouster of  Hero came last summer just a few weeks after the entire management team
of the Lied Animal Shelter from 2001-2002 called for Mary Herro's removal as president.  This team
included two veterinarians, and three managers, and the former director of operations there.. 
They all stood together to blow the whistle on the fraud and mass killing at the Lied Animal
Shelter, particularly after Mary reinstated her horrible daughter Stacy as the manager of the
shelter.  The result?  More than 800 killings in just one month -- June of 2002!!  (The board did
demand and receive Stacy's dismissal.)

Meanwhile, they raise money and hold themselves out as a no-kill sanctuary.  This while animals
are slaughtered just for having ringworm or kennel cough, or are killed in mass numbers out of
Lost &amp; Found - never even making it to adoptions - if considered old, ugly, or otherwise chosen
for death.  In addition, many know that the Animal Foundation failed its two audits by the city
(one in 1998, the other in 2001).

 Terrorism bill--A. 4884 (Smith)/S. 2996 (Kuhl)
 
 
 I happen to see former Assemblyman Marty Luster in
 the video store today. He 
 said he had appeared on a local talk radio program
 recently to talk against 
 A. 4884/S 2996. He said he thought that Kuhl would
 "take his cue from the 
 Asembly" and would wait until the bill had been
 passed in the Assembly to 
 unstar it in the Senate. He said he talked to Magee
 (chair of the Assembly 
 Agriculture Committe) and that Magee said he
 intended to bring the bill for 
 a vote in committee.  He also said he thought people
 ought to write to Smith 
 and ask him to withdraw the bill. I told him that I
 was mad at the NYCLU 
 because they had not responded to my letter or my
 phone calls, asking them 
 to come out against this bill. (Luster had been a
 lawyer for the ACLU years 
 ago.) He said he would call the NYCLU and try to
 talk to them. I asked him 
 if my interpretation (of the bill) that a person
 photographing their 
 neighbor treating a pet cruelly would make the
 photographer a felon was 
 correct and he agreed. (For the cruel neighbor, on
 the other hand, it's only 
 a misdemeanor.)
 
 Here's what I'd like people to do:
 
 1. Write to Smith and ask him to withdraw the bill.
 Send a copy of your 
 letter to Kuhl.

 2. Send a letter to your assemblymember, opposing

 your letter to all 
 members of the Assembly Ag. Committee would be even
 better. You can get

 out of committee. If

 committee, it's because he 
 thinks it will pass.

Book

The Big Fix: How the Pharmaceutical Industry Rips Off American Consumers
The Big Fix opens with feisty 77 year old Melva McCuddy from Ohio struggling
to find more than $6000 a year to pay for her multiple medications. We learn
that she travels across the United States border to Canada, where her breast
cancer drug, tamoxifen, is eight times cheaper than in her local pharmacy.
Then we meet her son and grandson, both with medical troubles of their own,
and discover that the family has three generations without any insurance
cover for pharmaceuticals, and three generations forced to rely on handouts
from their doctors. "The worst thing," Melva told the audience at the book's
launch in Washington DC this month, "is being forced to beg doctors for free
samples."
Written in a plain, clear, direct style, and with its research funded in
part by the AFL-CIO-the umbrella labour organisation in the United
States-The Big Fix is an attempt to educate working Americans about the
dirty tricks of the pharmaceutical industry. With the soaring costs of drugs
and health care set to become the biggest domestic issue in next year's US
presidential election, the book is certainly timely.

Anyone familiar with the industry's antics won't find much that's new in The
Big Fix. It is, however, a remarkably accessible round-up of the best
evidence and the sharpest analysis about key issues, including drug pricing,
patent battles, excessive profiteering, misleading marketing, disease
mongering and doctor-drug company entanglement. Author Katharine Greider has
distilled much scientific research, interviewed many key academics and
activists, and made her way through bulky reports from Congressional
hearings and other investigations.

One of my favourite lines is a comment that comes originally from a drug
company marketer quoted in the magazine Pharmaceutical Executive. The
marketer is discussing the "brilliant" way in which a new condition called
"erectile dysfunction" had been "branded" to help build a market for new
drugs. "We're creating patient populations just as we're creating medicines,
to make sure that products become blockbusters."

Luella Vedric, New York socialite and animal advocate answers questions
...
When did you give up wearing fur?
-- Terry Mulley, Columbus

When I realized how wicked a practice it was! And when I realized one
could look gorgeous while not wearing fur, of course! You know I am now
a major contributor to SPOMA [Society for the Prevention of Mistreatment 
of Animals]. Collie's [SPOMA director Catherine Carnes] one of my dearest
friends. 

Do you support other animal rights groups like PETA? What do you think about
more forceful advocates like ELF, AJL, and SPEAC?
-- Don Rabinowitz, New York

I think I need some alphabet soup to figure them all out! But really dears, I
support SPOMA, but I don't like violent groups. I'm against violence toward
any animal and people are just another kind of animal.
...
Do you have any pets, besides Lily, that is?
-- Donna Ghostley, Richmond

I have an enormous tropical fish habitat at home. I love tropical fish!
And they are very well cared for. Mr. Kim, my supplier, is always checking
up on how they are doing. I have the most wonderful Zebra fish and rays and
arowanas.

Vivisection: a 'moderate' proposal.

The problem with vivisection, argues Derrick Jensen, is
that
we&#x2019;re experimenting on the wrong sort of animals.
To the dismay of many of my friends, I&#x2019;m not unalterably
opposed to vivisection. In fact, I&#x2019;d wholeheartedly support
it were vivisectors to make one minor administrative
change.
It would be that scientists perform the experiments not on
nonhumans but on themselves and their colleagues.
Scientists keep telling us how beneficial the experiments
are for Science with a capital &#x2018;S&#x2019;, Progress with a capital
&#x2018;P&#x2019; and, of course, Man with a capital &#x2018;M&#x2019;. If the
experiments really are Necessary with a capital &#x2018;N&#x2019;, the
scientists should be willing to make this sacrifice (with a
small &#x2018;s&#x2019;) for the greater good. In any case, according to
no other than Lord Sainsbury, UK minister for innovation
and
science, advocate of genetic engineering and owner of a
large supermarket chain, strict regulations ensure that
experiments generally cause no more than &#x2018;moderate&#x2019;
suffering. If this is actually true, scientists shouldn&#x2019;t
object too much to throwing their hats into this ring.
Now, I&#x2019;m sure you can spot the problem: there are too many
important experiments for the number of vivisectors. In
Europe alone an animal is killed in a laboratory every
three
seconds. In Britain it&#x2019;s one every 12 seconds, in Japan one
every other second and in the USA one per second. I&#x2019;m not
sure even full-fee scholarships and high salaries will
suffice to bring in enough scientists to fill this bill.

War dog makes it out of Iraq 

Once-scruffy Fluffy overcomes red tape, finds home in U.S.


The Pentagon called it Operation Free Fluffy and, thanks to dogged 
determination by the Army and others, the decidedly unconventional rescue mission now 
ranks as another win in the war in Iraq. Fluffy, the once-malnourished commando 
canine who protected a U.S. Special Forces unit in northern Iraq, was reunited 
over the weekend with the Army handler who could not bear to leave the loyal 
dog behind in Iraq. "People pulled together for a dog who supported us the 
whole time we were in Iraq and put himself on the line for our country," said 
Sgt. 1st Class Russell Joyce, an Army Special Forces soldier and Fluffy's 
handler. Fluffy is now ensconced in Joyce's North Carolina home, where he is enjoying 
the best living ever in his estimated two years of life, including a new 
doghouse Joyce built -- decked out with a marble floor, courtesy of leftover 
construction materials -- and nutritious American dog food, a far cry from the 
scraps he had barely subsisted on.

SENATE OKS ECOTERRORISM BILL

A measure aimed at cracking down on radical environmentalists who sabotage 
farms, timber operations and research facilities won approval Monday in the 
Oregon Senate. The bill passed 23-6 after its chief sponsor, Sen. Ted 
Ferrioli, said environmental vandalism has resulted in $50 million in damage 
in Oregon throughout the past decade. He cited incidents such as the 
firebombing of a car dealership, the torching of a timber company's office 
and the destruction of agricultural research projects, including ones 
involving genetically engineered trees. "Oregon needs a new mechanism to 
deal with the problem of ecosabotage," said Ferrioli, R-John Day.

Old men of the sea have all but gone

A decade-long trawl through the archives has revealed just how fast
industrial fishing fleets wipe out large fish

THE world's fisheries are in a far worse state than anyone thought. Great
predatory fish such as shark, marlin, swordfish and tuna that once filled
the seas are much scarcer today, according to a new assessment. Worse,
stocks that are thought to be flourishing may already have been stripped
bare without anyone noticing.
Many of the world's important fisheries have already collapsed. The most
notorious recent example is the cod fishery in the Atlantic off
Newfoundland, where a scientific advisory panel recommended earlier this
month that the Canadian government list Newfoundland's cod as an endangered
species. Now a decade-long trawl through the archives by marine ecologists
has revealed just how fast commercial fishing fleets clear the sea of large
fish.
Populations of these species plummet as soon as big fishing boats arrive,
the researchers found (Nature, vol 423, p 280). They fall by about 80 per
cent within the first 10 or 15 years, but eventually stabilise at around 10
per cent of the original numbers.

  Los Angeles is now seeing some of the first impacts from radical
  animal rights activists groups.  And this time, it isn't limited to fairly
  innocuous protests.  A formerly unknown group calling itself the Animal 
  Justice League smashed cash registers, broke windows and abducted "back 
  room" animals from 3 different PetSmart stores around the city in a 
  coordinated late night raid last night.  
  
  It is believed that the AJL activities were in response to PETA investigations
  accusing the chain of small animal abuses.  According to the PETA web site:
  During an undercover investigation at the PetSmart store in Manchester, 
  Connecticut, a store that has a Banfield Hospital right inside it and that 
  PetSmart boasts of as having an "outstanding pet care team" and an 
  "exceptional pet care record," PETA documented more than 100 small animals
  including hamsters, domestic rats, lizards, chinchillas, and birds deprived 
  of effective veterinary care and slowly dying, out of customers' sight."
  
  Faron Gardner, 32, of Los Angeles, is wanted by authorities in connection 
  with the incident. The Animal Justice League (AJL) states in its website that 
  this would not be the last revenge attack of its kind.
   
  The activities of the AJL appear to be similar to those of other radical groups
  such as ELF and the Revolutionary Cells. Authorities consider these violent acts
  to mark a new chapter in eco-militancy in 2003 that included the vandalism of 
  a Chiron executive's car and the trashing of a biology lab at Louisiana State 
  University last month.

North America?s first case of mad-cow disease in a decade ? in a
single cow in Alberta ? inspired Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to carve a juicy steak in front of TV cameras last month to
reassure the public and resuscitate the $22 billion beef trade
between the United States and Canada.

Yet many diners wonder: Is beef safe to eat?

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy has not been found in any U.S. beef
products. But Canada sends 1.7 million cattle south every year. Until
an import ban May 20 when the disease was discovered, processors
regularly mixed beef from both nations ? and others. 
...
But consumer advocates say Canada?s lone mad-cow case is a sentinel,
not an aberration. "The fact that [mad-cow] hasn?t been found here
doesn?t mean it isn?t here," said CSPI?s DeWaal. "It?s very likely
we?ll see a case or more of mad-cow disease here."
...
Because of its age, however, the infected Canadian cow could have
eaten tainted food before the ban. It took nearly four months to test
the Alberta cow. During that period, the cow was rendered and made
into food for chickens and dogs. Dogs and poultry can?t contract the
disease, but inspectors can?t prove that prion-laden feed didn?t
inadvertently contaminate feed meant for cattle.

And poultry may act as a reservoir for the disease. If chickens
picked up prions in their feed and were themselves processed into
cattle feed, it may perpetuate the outbreak in future herds, some
speculate.

Also questionable are blood and other protein materials used in
dozens of supplements, including weaning products for calves, Hansen
said.

A third potential loophole is cattle identification. The infected cow
in Alberta belonged to at least four herds. Investigators, slowed by
incomplete records, are still tracing its origins, offspring and
herdmates.

Portions have grown so slowly that you may not have noticed.

When Baby Boomers were babies, food servings were ample. Not
enormous, but more than enough. This is back when a majority of
Americans did not weigh way too much.

Families started to eat at restaurants more often, and fast food
became a family staple. Somewhere along the way, normal meals gave
way to stomach-stretching excess. 
...
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, meanwhile, says
that it has undertaken a study of two diets: a normal
don?t-stuff-yourself-with-doughnuts diet and an animal-free vegan
diet.

Since we already know people in the United States are consuming too
many calories and not exercising enough and high levels of
cholesterol are unhealthy, the aim of the PCRM study is obscure.

It would be shock if the vegan diet doesn?t come out ahead. The PCRM
has two additional studies under way. One seeks an answer to the
question "Can a vegan diet cure diabetes?" and the other is delving
into whether a vegan diet can relieve premenstrual syndrome.

The physicians are also extremely concerned about the use of animals
in research. While its Web site has a paragraph or two about diet, it
has 14 fact sheets decrying research conducted with animals.

The Center for Consumer Freedom sneers at the Physicians for Social
Responsibility. The CCF suggests that the PCRM is heavily funded by
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA.

In 2001, Eric Schlosser published "Fast Food Nation" ? an expose of
America's increasingly consolidated and industrialized food system,
and how that system contributes to a whole range of societal ills,
from obesity and resistance to antibiotics to urban sprawl, habitat
destruction, and poor labor conditions. The book was a smashing
success ? 66 weeks and running on the New York Times bestseller list
? and it captured the nation's attention in a way no book about food
has since Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, the 1906 classic about the
Chicago meatpacking industry.
...
Two new books are riding the same wave of interest in food that
launched "Fast Food Nation" to bestseller status. Marion Nestle's
Safe Food: Bacteria, Biotechnology, and Bioterrorism chronicles a
recent rise in food-borne illness and consumer distrust of food
companies such as Monsanto, and describes the downside of an
increasingly homogenized food marketplace.</docText>

New Report Exposes Contractor Bechtel as Threat to Iraqi Environment, Human 
Rights and Basic Services;
U.S. Taxpayers Blindly Funding Post-War Corporate Profiteering and Cronyism, 
Public Interest Groups Say
    
    
Bechtel Group Inc., one of the lead contractors 
in the reconstruction of Iraq, has a 100-year history of capitalizing on 
environmentally unsustainable technologies and reaping immense profits at the 
expense of societies and the environment, said a report released today by Public 
Citizen, Global Exchange and CorpWatch. Its release was timed to coincide with a 
day of direct actions around the country to protest Bechtel?s presence in 
Iraq, the report concludes that the Bush administration must be stopped from 
doling out contracts to undeserving firms with which it has close ties, including 
Bechtel and Halliburton. 
The report, Bechtel: Profiting from Destruction, provides case studies from 
Bechtel?s history of operations in the water, nuclear, energy and public works 
sectors. It documents a track record by Bechtel of environmental destruction, 
disregard for human rights and financial mismanagement of projects that has 
affected communities all over the world and does not bode well for the people of 
Iraq. 
"If environmental and consumer protection violations had been taken into 
account, Bechtel would not have been awarded such an important contract in Iraq," 
said Sara Grusky, senior organizer with Public Citizen. "The American people 
are funding this contract through their tax dollars but are being denied the 
right to see what their money is supporting."

Avian veterinarians have known for decades that Teflon-coated and other
non-stick cookware can produce fumes that are highly toxic to birds. As
early as 1986, a Chicago-area expert on "Teflon toxicosis" called the
phenomenon a "leading cause of death among birds," and estimated that
hundreds of birds are killed by the fumes and particles emitted from
Teflon-coated products each year [1][2]. Although an accurate national
accounting of deaths is not available, in a single year this Chicago
veterinarian documented 296 bird deaths in 105 cases involving non-stick
cookware.

Under ordinary cooking scenarios, Teflon kills birds. A review of the
literature and bird owners' accounts of personal experience with Teflon
toxicosis shows that Teflon can be lethal at normal cooking temperatures,
with no human lapses in judgment or wakefulness.

  Responses to recent animal rights raid on PetSmart 
  
  "Animals can't defend themselves -- other than say a
  lion or a tiger attacking a cruel trainer.  But for most
  it is up to people to act in defense of animals.  I'm not 
  for advocating violence, but I am for self-defense. Faron 
  Gardner and the others in the AJL are trying to stop the
  cruel exploitation of animals. If the harm to animals can 
  stopped, that outweighs the wrongs of breaking a law or 
  two."  - Cesar Gil, Los Angeles
  
  "For me, the real story is not that a store got vandalized
  and ransacked...the real story is that these hoods believe
  that animals are on the same level as people, and that they
  are justified in hurting people for the sake of dumb animals.
  They need to brush up on Genesis..." - Tony Jones, Alameda

Research funded by drug companies is more likely to produce results that 
favour the sponsor's product, reveals a new study.

Researchers analysed 30 previous reports examining pharmaceutical 
industry-backed research and found the conclusions of such research were 
four times more likely to be positive than research backed by other 
sponsors. "What we found was that in almost all cases there was a bias - a 
rather heavy bias - in favour [of a drug] when the study was industry 
funded," study leader Joel Lexchin told New Scientist. The main reasons for 
this, say the team, may be that positive studies are more likely to be 
published than negative ones. Also, inappropriate comparison drugs may be 
used in these trials, skewing findings in favour of the tested product. The 
new analysis is published in a special issue of the British Medical Journal, 
which focuses on the close relationship between doctors and the 
pharmaceutical industry.

Move over, Michael Jackson!  A new White Tufted-Ear 
Marmoset is in Town

You may know him as the singing superstar from the 
Hip Hop music scene, but those close to r'Bear say 
his time is now spent running a captive breeding program 
in Southern California to repopulate endangered species.

It's like, you take a Spix's Macaw and put him in 
the right tree with a Lady Spix's Macaw, and, like, the 
next thing you know, you got babies, said r'Bear, who 
invited us on a tour of Shraavana, his privately-funded 
exotic animal sanctuary 25 miles northwest of San Diego.

We call the little parrots 'hatchlings' in the business,
r'Bear added.

r'Bear established his exotic animal sanctuary two years 
ago with the help of several wildlife foundations.  If 
the breeding program is successful, the Foundations would 
like to reintroduce the species back into their natural habitat.  
In addition to Spix's Macaw, several other endangered 
exotics find a home at Shraavana.  The Arabian Oryx, the 
Golden Lion Tamerin and the Griffin Vulture were some of 
the first residents of the lush 5600 acre sanctuary.

We're hoping to add Trumpeter Swans when the lake is finished,
r'Bear explains as we drive past a large muddy construction 
area.  And if we can get a salt-water tank we might get a 
couple of Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtles.

r'Bear tells us most of his animals are purchased from 
overseas sources, but occasionally his agent gets a call from 
someone looking to find a home for their oversize boa.

We don't take those, he explains.  They're better off in a 
zoo where they can be, you know, taken care of by zoo 
professionals.

Cattle Killed In Farm Fire

It was a story you saw first on 3. 52 cows are dead, &amp; a house is 
destroyed. The man deputies believe, is responsible, is in custody. All 
that remains of the house is smoking debris. The man, who deputies say, 
burned down the house &amp; killed all his cattle is in jail, held without 
bail. He faces multiple charges including arson, reckless endangerment and 
animal cruelty. 54-year old Chester Gigliuto is the owner of the house. 
Deputies continue to investigate exactly what led this farmer to commit 
these terrible crimes. Investigator Mark Helms of the Cortland County 
Sheriff's Department says, "basically at this point it looks to be 
primarily a financial situation and that this was the only way he felt he 
could deal with it." Gigliuto was renting the house to 3 adults They are 
23-year old, Robert Keegan, 18-year old, Michel Croghan, and Gigliuto's 
stepson, 21-year old Joseph Lavancha. Lavancha spent part of the day 
sifting through the smokey rubble. He told Action News that his stepfather 
warned him that he had plans to destroy the house. He says Gigliuto was 
very much in debt. The people were in the process of removing their 
belongings from the house but they were too late. Yesterday morning, when 
no one was home, gigliuto poured gallons of fuel on the first and second 
floors of the house and set it on fire. But that wasn't the only thing 
gigliuto destroyed yesterday. Deputies say he also told them that he 
killed all 52 of his cattle using a rifle. Gigliuto was leasing a barn 
just about a mile and a half from the house where he kept the cows. David 
Perry is the owner of the property. He says it's a sad situation ...all 
the animals were shot in the head.

DISEASES BY DESIGN 

From Buzz to Bowwow
In his research, Xu induced tumors in flies by genetic screens in mosaic 
animals (a technique not possible in mice) to remove a tumor-suppressing 
gene from a small number of the insects' somatic cells. As in patients with 
cancer, the flies carried the mutation in some cells, and tumors 
consequently developed, Xu says. He then saved the flies from tumorigenesis 
by introducing a human LATS1 (large tumor suppressor) gene into a model 
lacking the fly homolog. His lab also generated mice deficient for LATS1; 
tumors developed in these mice as well.

The work showed that an invertebrate tumor suppressor is also a tumor 
suppressor in mammals, Xu says. It also uncovered evidence that LATS1 is a 
negative regulator for enzymes that drive the cell cycle, he adds. Once 
initial studies are finished on mice or other small organisms, researchers 
sometimes turn to larger models, such as cats or dogs. Besides the 
advantages of size and longevity, diseases that affect humans will sometimes 
spontaneously develop. Haskins works specifically with these kinds of cat 
and dog models, running an NIH-funded resource that makes the models 
available for research.

The animals "come to us because they have been sick, so they're relevant 
models," he says. He oversees colonies of cats and dogs with 25 different 
genetic diseases, including lysosomal storage diseases, congenital heart 
disease, skin disease, erythrocyte enzyme disorders, congenital deafness, 
and X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. His research focuses on 
applications of gene therapy for lysosomal storage diseases, which are 
caused by inherited genetic defects that result in an enzyme deficiency. 
Haskins has successfully prevented clinical manifestations of one such 
disease, mucopolysaccharidosis VII, a rare and inherited degenerative 
disorder that is generally fatal in both dogs and humans.

The cameras are rolling at Purdue University's
animal research center, tracking a half-dozen pigs, each with an ink
streak slathered across its back for identification.

The pigs have a choice to make. They can use their snouts either to
let them into a pen where they can socialize with other pigs, or to
gain entry to another pen with more food.

``We want to get the animal's perspective, to see what they prefer,''
explains Edmond A. Pajor, the assistant professor of animal behavior
and welfare who heads the Purdue center. ``We want to know: How
important is social contact and space? What do they like and need?''
...
McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Wendy's all have underwritten
research and recently hired what are called ``animal welfare
specialists'' to help them devise new standards aimed at ensuring
more humane treatment of the animals destined for their kitchens.
Industry trade groups are promoting the new rules and conducting
audits of livestock producers to assure they are being followed,
though some groups express concern about higher costs and other
complications.
...
The changes are being applauded even by PETA (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals), an organization best known for guerrilla
attacks on the fur industry and fast-food outlets, and for
publicizing photographs of what they say are cruel acts being
performed on farm animals.

``McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's have done some pretty good
stuff, but they had to be prodded into it,''' said Dan Shannon, a
spokesman for PETA. ``These animals are not living in luxury suites
being hand-fed grapes, but this is an improvement.''

PIGS COULD ONE DAY SHORTEN THE WAIT FOR A TRANSPLANT

Parkinson's disease was eroding James Finn's ability to move and speak, and
none of the usual drugs helped. So when his doctor suggested an experimental
procedure, he decided to go for it. On Sept. 24, 1996, he had holes drilled
into his skull so that surgeons could implant millions of neurons to replace
a chemical his brain was not producing. The transplant came from an unusual
source: a pig, reports U.S. News &amp; World Report.

Today, Finn's story traces the promise and disappointments of
animal-to-human transplantation, a strategy that could one day ease the
shortage of replacement organs like hearts and kidneys as well as tissues
for treating illnesses like diabetes. Finn himself is convinced that the pig
donation helped him: "It has allowed me to live a much more normal life."
But Diacrin, the company that sponsored the study, decided to abandon
animal-to-human transplants after lackluster results in other patients,
joining other companies that fled the xenotransplantation field after a
mid-1990s rush of enthusiasm. Now, however, there's a new, if cautious,
optimism that animal transplants may yet realize their promise, and do so
before the other great hope for replacement tissues, human stem cells. "We
all hope for stem cells, but before that we will have xenotransplantation,"
says Bernhard Hering at the University of Minnesota.

EU'S CONSUMERS CALL SHOTS

Imagine it is 2005 and the European Parliament has just passed its latest 
animal welfare directive: Failure to provide dairy cows with access to the 
internet will be now be deemed an abuse of animal welfare. Forced to comply 
or lose access to EU markets, New Zealand farmers protest that our cows 
don't even like computers. Their hoofs aren't well suited to using the 
mouse. Still our paddocks must go online. It might be a ludicrous example 
but sadly it isn't as far from reality as you would think.

The most disturbing theme to arise at this month's international dairy 
development conference in Sweden was that it will be the whims of urbanised, 
animal-loving European consumers, not science, that determine how we treat 
our animals. The agricultural sector is going to have to deal with the gap 
between the reality of farming and the traditional images of cows we see on 
dairy packages and in television advertisements, Swedish and European MP 
Marit Paulsen told delegates at the conference. She said the industry needed 
to address welfare issues and then educate consumers about the realities of 
where their food comes from.

ON THE CRUSADE FOR FARM-ANIMAL WELFARE

When animals are on the downhill slide, it usually means people are, too. 
Peter Presland's patch is the lower half of the South Island, "from 
Ashburton to the Antarctic," he jokes. The Dunedin-based animal welfare 
investigator &#x2013; one of five throughout the country in MAF's special 
investigation group &#x2013; spends a lot of time on the road, looking into his 
share of the 1000-plus complaints the ministry receives each year.

Eighty percent of these are minor, such as a lame horse. Of the serious 
cases, only 10 to 20 end up in court. He has been involved in two 
high-profile court cases in the south this year involving animals being 
neglected. "The farmer's state of mind and the condition of the animals are 
invariably linked," he says. "No one sets out to starve their animals." If 
the farm is shipshape, the problem is probably minor; if the farm's a mess, 
the farmer's life probably is too. "He might have had a serious health 
setback, or his wife might have left him. Whatever the reason, he gets to 
the point where he can't manage and doesn't want to get up in the morning. 
"He loses interest in everything, including his stock." No matter how bad 
the situation, Mr Presland always tries to work with the farmer so the 
animal problem can be solved.

When the farmer has agreed to take the necessary remedial steps, Mr Presland 
usually leaves him to it, only following up with a phone call or a visit if 
his sixth sense tells him the farmer is bluffing. "If that fails, if the 
owner doesn't do what he has to do, clearly there has to be a more robust 
approach, including the possibility of court action." Even better than 
fixing the problem is preventing it in the first place.

The other part of his role is educative &#x2013; "spreading the gospel" about 
minimum standards of animal care to saleyard managers, stock agents and 
transport operators as well as farmers. But major cases of animal neglect 
don't happen overnight. They start with small signs and that's when Mr 
Presland believes the farmer's community can play a crucial role. "My 
experience is that other farmers in the area knew all along there was a 
problem and turned a blind eye." People saw their neighbour struggling but 
hesitated to become involved in case it was seen as being nosy. "A phone 
call, a bit of a helping hand back then could have saved the situation."

French anti-globalisation activist Bove jailed 

Radical French
farmer-protester Jose Bove was arrested at his home on
Sunday and taken to prison to serve a 10-month
sentence for destroying genetically modified plants,
his lawyer said.  
  
       Bove, who rose to prominence in the 1990s for
denouncing globalisation and junk food, was convicted
last November of ripping up genetically modified rice
and maize plants in separate incidents in 1998 and
1999. 
       Though he was sentenced seven months ago, Bove
had refused to give himself up and supporters had
pledged to defend him when police came to take him
away. 
       Bove was arrested at daybreak by dozens of
police who charged through a glass doorway of Bove's
home west of the southern city of Montpellier. He was
bundled aboard a helicopter and taken to the nearby
Villeneuve-les-Maguelone prison. 
       ''The gendarmes went into his house after
breaking through a window, without even ringing the
bell,'' lawyer Francois Roux said. ''He was alone. He
obviously did not resist and they immediately took him
away by helicopter.''

A serial cat killer is stalking the West.
...
It makes you wonder what kind of cruel, diabolical, psycho-monster could
perpetrate such heinous acts.

And it makes you wonder: Does Bill Frist have an alibi?

Bill Frist ? you know who that is. He?s a U.S. senator from Tennessee who
took over the Senate Majority Leader job from Sen. Trent Lott, R-KKK. He?s
also a cardiac surgeon. He became famous when he raced from the Senate to
treat a crazed gunman who had stormed the Capitol and killed two Capitol
police officers.
...
In his 1989 autobiography, ?Transplant: A Heart Surgeon?s Account of the
Life and Death Dramas of the New Medicine,? Frist describes his education
at the Harvard Medical School, an education that included dissecting animals.

For decades, John Banzhaf III was known as the only lawyer in the world
willing to take on Big Tobacco. He won that one, engineering roughly 900
lawsuits that eventually persuaded juries to award billions of dollars in
compensation.

Now he's going after fat. Using the same legal approach, he has sparked
what is widely seen as a movement to force fast-food companies to cut the
calories and fat content in their products -- and to tell consumers just
what they're consuming.

"We've demonstrated that it can work and can be a very effective weapon,"
he said this week from his office in the law faculty at George Washington
University in Washington, D.C. "If I can take the same concept and make it
work, to me, that is wonderful feedback."

WORLD DEMONSTRATION DAY

JULY 16, 2003



Bok Days are the hottest days of the year in Korea. They are also the days 
in which the greatest number of dogs are consumed.  Some Koreans believe 
that eating dog-meat stew will alleviate the summer heat, in addition to 
increasing a man's sexual prowess. While this season spans 30 days, only 
three days are designated Bok Days; this year they fall on July 16th, (the 
beginning of the season) July 26th, and August 15th.



We need as many people to support these demonstrations against dog-eating 
as we can get!  Each year over 2.6 million dogs and hundreds of thousands 
of cats are tortured and killed for human consumption.  Korean dog eaters 
believe that the more a dog suffers, the more tender and sexually potent 
the meat.  Korea's 1991 Animal Protection Law makes it illegal to harm or 
abuse dogs, cats and all other animals, and yet the Korean government does 
nothing to stop these atrocities.  With our show of international force, we 
will lobby the Korean government for stronger, enforceable animal 
protection laws that will protect companion animals from being eaten.



If you are curious about how our demonstrations operate, please see 
www.koreananimals.org/update.htm for examples.  You can also download 
flyers for the demonstrations from the same page.



Please join us on July 16th for our annual Bok Days protests!  All demos 
start at noon, unless otherwise noted. 
Thank you and lets make some noise for the cats and dogs of Korea!

Clownfish Calamity


or



Murky Water on the Showbiz Reef





             Finding Nemo is Disney&#x2019;s latest bid for another billion bucks,
and the Devil gets his due for some solid social messages on a most
impressionable audience. Too bad the debilitating burden falls yet again on
species of a lesser greed.

             That is, Disney learned the hard way with 101 Dalmatians that 
a
multi-million dollar cartoon will result in a huge demand for the cartoon
characters. 101 stimulated dog breeders and puppy mills to pump thousands 
of
Dalmatian pups in time for Xmas (the season of giving, don&#x2019;t you know). By
May, animal shelters across the country were swamped with gangly,
high-energy Dalmatian turn-ins that just weren&#x2019;t working out. Many were in
estrus. Many were put down.

             Of course Disney could not have predicted this dire 
consequence
of a lovable cartoon the first time around. Given the experience of 101,
however, Disney did know, yet maintained a stonewall oblivion on the reef
carnage potential of Nemo. If Disney did not foresee the carnage, then
Disney could have stepped up and spoken on behalf of reef fish around the
world. Yet not one talk bubble has yet broken the surface from the 
Corporate
Megalith now shaping the mindset and behavior of young America. As my
longtime friend and snorkel buddy Matt Roving put it, &#x201c;Forty million on
promotion and not one dime in tribute.&#x201d; Disney culpability is palpable and
exasperating.

Something is rotten in the tropical fish import business and not just some dead
fish.

A southern environmentalist has succeeded in trapping poachers by conducting sting 
operations in Brazil - and Darla Banks loves doing this. 

She carries a concealed camera in her handbag and secretly films illegal 
freshwater fish collections, including the rare Black arwana and Cruz' Dwarf 
Pearlfish.   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 340-500 million fishes are kept in American homes (three times the total 
number of dogs and cats). Trade in fish grows every year. At least US$ 215 million 
in tropical fishes are handled every year in the US. The US imports 125 
million of ornamental fishes per year - US$ 25-30 million/year.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a wildlife detective, Banks, 32, often bluffs her way into trafficking networks, 
claiming to run Internet distribution sites or a provider of counterfeit certifications. 

This is a dangerous world and she is one of the few women on the frontline. 
It is something she is happy to use to her advantage.

"When I'm on an investigation and dealing with poachers then I am 
sometimes treated differently," Banks, who is from Alabama, told the Daily Record.

Yet animal trafficking has a more sinister side to it. The illegal trade in wild animals 
is linked to other types of illegal activities such as drugs. In South America, drug
cartels, which make use of the fauna to transport their products,
are deeply involved with the illegal wildlife trade. Drugs are frequently
found within live animals or are hidden in their skins. In 1998,cocaine bags
were found within the stomachs of some boas seized in Rio de Janeiro.

Banks has been involved in undercover operations to expose the 
illegal trade in endangered tropical fish. Fish are in demand from people 
wanting trophies to display, while drug traffickers use yet another channel to
supply the US. "I step lightly around cartel activity," notes Banks

Banks works for the conservation group, Renctas, which campaigns against the 
destruction of natural habitats in Brazil. 

Banks joined as a volunteer eight years ago and is now a senior 
campaigner often concentrating on trying to reverse the impacts of poaching.

Anti-tobacco lawyer John Banzhaf is presently building more solid test
cases against food corporations for knowingly selling products that are
injurious to consumers' health. Banzhaf will send a letter to McDonald's,
Wendy's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken this
month, demanding that they label their food as containing substances that
may be as addictive as nicotine.

At the same time, there is talk of imposing a "fat tax" and/or forcing
manufacturers to put health warnings on certain foods, similar to the
warnings on tobacco products. McDonalds is apparently feeling the
pressure. They have recently issued a request to their meat suppliers to
reduce the quantity of antibiotics in their meat, perhaps a pre-emptive
measure, intended to demonstrate concern about the health impact of their
products in case of future lawsuits. 
...
Yet the balance of influences on our dietary choices has changed
dramatically over the last two centuries. Two hundred years ago, people
tended to stay in one small region for most of their lives and had little
or no access to the world outside. The influences on their diet were
predominantly regional and familial. They ate the foods that were home
grown, hand reared, or caught in their locale. Fresh meat, seafood,
vegetables and fruits could not be transported thousands of miles in a few
hours, so people tended only to eat locally grown, seasonal produce and
locally butchered meat. All the crops, vegetables and fruits were organic,
because chemical fertilizers and pesticides had not been invented. All the
eggs and chickens were "free range", and growth hormones, antibiotics and
steroids were not fed to livestock, so all meat and dairy produced was
chemical free. Supermarkets, mass media, and industrial food production
techniques did not exist. Even eating in restaurants was a rare experience
for most, since the majority population lived in rural areas and the few
restaurants that existed were in cities.
...
As John Banzhaf constructs his case, instead of pursuing the unproven
notion that fast foods contain addictive ingredients, he should consider
the more insidious and pervasive power of the media and commerce to create
unhealthy dietary preferences and to eliminate real consumer freedom of
choice.

FOOD POISONING EATS AWAY MUM'S BODY

A mother of four has, according to this story, lost both legs, nearly all of 
her fingers and part of her nose after contracting a rare type of food 
poisoning. Debbie West, 37, believes she became sick from eating salami. She 
nearly died and was on life support in a Brisbane hospital for five weeks. 
The story says that Mrs West, who runs a Northern Territory crash repair 
business with her husband Nick in Katherine, fell ill in mid-March. She was 
diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome, know as "hamburger disease" 
because it is usually contracted through eating uncooked meat. Doctors are 
at a loss to explain why a healthy woman in her 30s has been struck down by 
the disease.

Mrs West was rushed to Royal Darwin Hospital after becoming cold and turning 
purple. "All her organs started to shut down and so doctors induced her into 
a coma," Ms Cowie said. "Her body was under so much stress that they 
couldn't allow her to breath on her own so they ventilated her. Her kidneys 
weren't working, so she was put on dialysis."

Mrs West was flown to Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital. As a side 
effect of the syndrome, she suffered severe blood clotting and surgeons were 
forced to carry out a series of amputations. She had her legs cut off from 
10cm below the knees and lost all the fingers on her right hand and parts of 
her fingers on her left hand. Doctors are hoping skin grafts will save what 
is left. Mrs West also has had the tip and septum of her nose amputated. 
"How she is alive is amazing. Nobody expected her to live through this," Ms 
Cowie said. "I can't help thinking that she has survived because of all the 
people behind her. "She has her bad days where she thinks it's unfair. But a 
lot of the time she looks to the brighter side of it and now she's just 
concentrating on having the operations, doing the rehabilitation and getting 
home."

POULTRY GROWERS RATTLED

Snow Hill, Md. -- Jeanne Shockley stands with her hands on her hips, 
squinting in the midday sun as her husband arrives in his pickup truck, the 
tires kicking up dust clouds as it brakes to a stop. She called him in from 
the fields because the electricity went off again in one of the long, 
low-slung corrugated metal sheds behind her, and inside, the temperature is 
rising. It won't take long for this to become a problem for the nearly 
20,000 growing chicks inside. Without power on hot summer days, it's nearly 
impossible to keep chickens from overheating. When they're chicks, giant 
heat lamps keep the birds at a constant 88 degrees. As they get bigger, 
industrial-strength fans blow through the chicken houses, and an overhead 
fogging system intermittently mists them with cool water. "The whole idea of 
the situation here is to grow 'em till they're fat," said Virgil Shockley, 
who raises more than half a million birds each year on Maryland's Eastern 
Shore for Tyson Foods. After 42 days, the birds will weigh 41/2 pounds and 
will become rotisserie roasters for supermarkets, one of the many 
specialized products that have helped the industry combat lagging 
consumption of chicken, bloated supplies and competition from foreign 
imports.

This will be one of the last flocks the Shockleys raise for Tyson. The 
nation's largest poultry company is pulling out of Maryland, starting the 
process at its Berlin factory over the holiday weekend by reducing the 
workforce. Until now, trucks brought an estimated half-million chickens to 
the plant every day. This week, Wednesday deliveries will cease and the 
number of birds processed the rest of the week will begin to shrink. Farmers 
such as the Shockleys, who are hired to raise the chickens, wonder whether 
the three remaining poultry companies that operate in the state -- Perdue 
Farms, Allen Family Foods and Mountaire Farms -- will fill the void. 
Weighing heavily on their minds is whether, and how, Maryland's new governor 
will keep his campaign promise to make Maryland once again friendly to 
business. Their concern is, of course, poultry. Worth $552 million a year, 
chickens represent the largest segment of the state's $1.6 billion farming 
industry. When a giant such as Tyson shuts down a processing plant, it sends 
ripples across the state.

Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) has said he thinks less regulation and more 
cooperation is the way to promote business and stimulate the economy. 
Environmentalists fear he is poised to let the farming community slide on 
the critical job it needs to do to stop polluting the Chesapeake Bay 
watershed. For poultry farmers, the fear is that market forces will prove 
greater than anything the governor could do to help them, spelling doom to 
the family farms of Delmarva. "If you don't have poultry on the Shore, then 
you don't have farms," said Virgil Shockley, a third-generation crop and 
poultry farmer. When he found out that Tyson was leaving, Shockley called 
the company and asked whether they wanted him to grow chickens for their 
Temperanceville plant in Virginia. The answer was no. He started dialing 
everyone he could think of -- the county economic development board, other 
commissioners, agriculture specialists, other poultry companies. By the time 
he got to state officials, the message was already clear: Something needed 
to be done to ensure that Tyson's departure wasn't the beginning of the end 
of the poultry industry in Maryland. "Who else do I need to call?" Shockley 
asked Agriculture Secretary Lew Riley. "Nobody," Riley replied. "You've done 
enough."

WASHINGTON, July 6 &#x2014; Officials at the National Zoo suspect that a large cat got into a bald eagle&#x2019;s enclosure and killed the bird, perhaps already weakened by fierce storms and unable to fly. It is the latest in a series of animal deaths at the zoo. The male eagle died Friday morning, the same day that the zoo celebrated a new exhibit designed especially for bald eagles hurt in the wild.
 THE DEAD EAGLE was housed separately from the zoo&#x2019;s two new eagles that were donated by American Eagle Foundation based at singer Dolly Parton&#x2019;s Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.
       The 21-year-old eagle, found by a zookeeper early Thursday, had severe puncture wounds to his abdomen and back, spokeswoman Julie Mason said. Zookeepers suspect a large cat crept into the cage and attacked the eagle, who could have been injured during Wednesday night&#x2019;s fierce rain storms.

Shriners Physically Attack Activists
 
Over two dozen animal rights activists peacefully protested the Shriners' 
abuse of animals through circuses (see www.Circuses.com) today at their national 
convention in Minneapolis.  We were decked out in Sad Clown costumes and held 
signs with slogans such as "Shrine Circus = Animal Abuse" as well as posters 
with pictures of animals tortured in circuses.
 
We were surprised at the large number of Shriners (who all looked like they 
were about to give birth) hurling insults and swearing at us.  Some examples 
follow:
 
1.  One Shriner repeatedly called us "Mother f-ckers", with NO provocation.
2.  A group of Shriners called female activists "dykes" and told us to "use 
this" while waving a plastic, penis-shaped cigar holder in our faces and making 
sexual gestures with it;
3. Shriner after Shriner called us "assholes", told us to "get a job" and 
otherwise insulted us;
4. Shriner after Shriner, when asked by a 7 year-old boy if they would take a 
flier, told him "go to hell", "you're sick", and "asshole" (some love for 
children, huh?);
5.  Shriners continuously flipped us off, called us names, and insulted us.

Several months ago, the Washington City Paper, our weekly ?alternative?
newsweekly, ran a feature article that took a critical look at the Fresh
Fields grocery store chain. If you are unfamiliar with Fresh Fields
supermarkets (owned by the Whole Foods grocery chain), they are basically
like your typical food co-op transformed into a regular grocery store. The
typical Fresh Fields market has just about every vegetarian item being
distributed, a large produce section, a bakery, and a deli where you can
find ?free range? meats. The prices are high, so it?s not surprising that
the Fresh Fields I visit on occasion is populated by upper middle class
Yuppies.
...
Then I started reading between the lines. This was not your average
alternative newsweekly fluff piece; this was a cleverly placed stealth
article by a writer who was friendly to the right-wing libertarian
Manhattan Institute, a Washington think tank. The article certainly took
the Fresh Fields chain to task for its Yuppie clientele and expensive
vegetarian food. But it had nothing to say about the fact that Fresh
Fields stores aren?t unionized (workers are paid far less than unionized
corporate grocery stores in the area) nor did it mention the strange
financial backers of the chain, in this case being a bunch of investors
who are affiliated with defense contractors. The article also didn?t
bother to provide a more radical critique, which could have pointed out,
that a corporate chain selling free range chicken is no substitute for a
worker-owned food co-op. No, the writer used cheap attacks on Yuppie
vegetarians to veil her real agenda, which was attacking the organic food
movement and current activism against genetically modified food.

There are many consequences to the massive scale of our food production,
distribution, marketing, and consumption. While we may celebrate its
?convenience? or laude the ?freedom of choice? it seems to provide, in
reality its convenience masks disturbing inefficiencies, unsustainable
extractive practices, and terrible injustices in distribution. The
apparent abundance masks a basic orthodoxy in the way our food is grown,
processed, and marketed. ?Freedom of choice? really is not what it seems,
since in fact we obtain most of our food within a narrowly defined system
of capitalist production, underwritten by government subsidy at all levels
from the point of production (price controls, fallow payments,
environmental clean-up of toxins, wars to protect fuel inputs, and laws
that favor large-scale farms at the expense of family farms and
smallholding) to the point of consumption (food stamps, laws that favor
corporate supermarkets). We have many ?choices? within one basic food
system, rather than many choices within a heterogeneous food system.
...
Vegans may wince, but cane sugar is responsible for far more animal deaths
even at the level of species extinction than honey will ever be. Fruit and
vegetable sugars, if obtainable locally, can be as responsible as honey.

(Los Angeles) A package of beef and a letter from 
"Animal Justice League" claiming that meat had been 
poisoned in 20 Los Angeles supermarkets was left 
at the Los Angeles Times, 1st Street offices. The paper
also received a phone call taking credit for the action 
and stating, "We will take direct action againsts animal
abuse in whatever form is necessary to stop the cruelty." 
A similar threat was made against a supermarket 
in Upsala in November. No poisoned meat was found at
either supermarket.

'Shameful'
John W. Kimbrell of Inman [SC] says it is "absolutely shameful" that the
Spartanburg Humane Society is still critically low on operating funds,
still short-staffed, still closed to adoptions on Wednesdays and Sundays
and still receiving up to 10 or more animals a day. "Since the excess are
euthanized, I find it difficult to understand why people abandon pets
there, buy pets from breeders, neglect to get pets fixed and tolerate the
city and county defaulting on their ethical responsibilities," says Mr.
Kimbrell. "If it is true that one can judge the morality of a community
by the way it treats animals, one need only consider the nearly 15,000
companion animals lovingly slaughtered at our shelter last year to see
where we stand morally and ethically."</docText>

With the release in May of a 111-page document by the New Jersey
Department of Agriculture, "Humane Treatment of Domestic Livestock,
Proposed New Rules," the state has unleashed a small storm, pitting
animal-rights supporters and their notable spokespeople, including actress
Mary Tyler Moore, against large New Jersey farmers and livestock-industry
representatives from neighboring states.

The clatter is unusual for agricultural rules, which usually concern more
quiet matters, such as dairy licensing fees or proper apple storage. The
humane farming issue, in contrast, has turned New Jersey, the first state
to consider such rules, into something of an animal-rights battleground,
coming amid heightened concerns nationally about the treatment of farm
animals.

A number of cities across the country, from Newark to Cocoa Beach, Fla.,
to Berkeley, Calif., have adopted official proclamations on the humane
treatment of "sentient beings." And a handful of fast-food producers,
including McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's, have begun financing
research into what makes livestock happy.
...
Animal supporters say the "humane" rules are anything but. In fact, they
say, the rules would protect big farmers, not animals.

Lifted in part from industry guidelines, the rules would, for example,
permit calves raised for veal to be kept crated, chained, and without
bedding until slaughter.

Pregnant pigs could continue to live in "gestation crates,"
2-foot-by-7-foot metal cages that don't allow the sows to turn around, a
practice outlawed by voters in Florida last year and by several European
countries.

Laying hens could live in "battery cages" - small wire-mesh pens where
four or more chickens are confined.

And "forced molting," the practice of depriving hens of food for up to 14
days to induce a new cycle of egg-laying, could also continue under the rules.

"The word 'humane' is in there and these standards are not humane at all,"
said Barbara Dyer, program coordinator for the mid-Atlantic office of the
Humane Society of the United States, in Mount Olive. "It looked like this
was going to improve conditions for livestock, and it actually does the
reverse. I think this is misleading the people of New Jersey."

July 15 ? Would you pay more to know that your meat was raised in the
United States? Are you concerned about the conditions in which animals are
kept while they're being raised for slaughter? Do you care if your meat
has antibiotics in it or if your food contains genetically modified
ingredients?

If so, you're one of many consumers who are affecting the way food is
manufactured and labeled in the United States.

At a time when a lot of attention is being paid to issues like food
safety, mad cow disease and genetically modified foods, many companies and
the government are responding to both consumers' and activists' concerns
about the food supply.

"We'd always say give the consumer as much information as you can and he's
free to ignore it and free to make whatever decision he's going to make,"
says Art Jaeger, associate director of the Consumer Federation of America,
a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.
...
Recent moves include fast-food giant McDonald's calling on its meat
suppliers to phase out the use of growth-promoting antibiotics in its
meat, a decision that will likely change the use of antibiotics in animals
since the chain is one of the world's largest purchasers of meat.

"It's really overwhelming how much of a change there's been," says PETA
campaign coordinator Dan Shannon. "Twenty-three years ago, the idea of
free-range farming didn't exist. The idea of vegetarianism as a popular,
accepted thing didn't exist. As far as the consumer side of things goes,
it's an exploding market."

PAMPLONA, Spain - Fugitivo panted hard. With blood streaming down his
legs, he stuck his tongue out and stared at the red cape as thousands
watched the final seconds of his four-year-old life.

Fugitivo, a gray 1,100-pound fighting bull, once lived on the Cebada Gago
ranch in southern Spain, but was noticed for his impressive horns. That
lured the scouts who picked the bulls for this year's San Fermin festival,
the annual fiesta that has attracted millions since Ernest Hemingway
chronicled it in the 1920s.

"We chose bulls from the most prestigious ranches, with the best horns,"
said Jesus Cia, one of the men responsible for picking the 60 bulls and
men who fight them.

With that, Fugitivo began an inexorable journey toward his ultimate fate:
becoming a bowl of wine-seasoned stew, served up at night in Pamplona's
restaurants.
...
"In the end, a bull is like a melon," he said. "You have to try it to know
if it's good or rotten."

Fight or no fight, from the moment a bull is dragged from the ring, the
business of selling the body begins.

Once a bull is bled and gutted, its head and hoofs are cut off and its
skin removed.

In the butcher shops and supermarkets of Pamplona, the meat sells for
between $2 and $4 a pound, depending on the cut. Some will end up in
Pamplona's beef stew.

Since mad cow disease rattled Europe's meat industry several years ago,
bulls undergo days of laboratory tests, delaying the sale by up to three days.

While the San Fermin bulls used to be butchered immediately outside the
bullring, the bulls are now merely bled here. They are then taken to a
slaughterhouse, where veterinarians extract brain tissue samples and check
for mad cow.

"It was more dignified when we used to cut the bulls up here," said Txema
Larragueta, an usher at the arena, watching as a forklift hoisted a
sagging animal and eased it into a refrigerated truck. "I preferred it
that way. The bulls kept their dignity."

HOUSE NARROWLY DEFEATS BAN ON SALE OF 'DOWNED ANIMALS'

Washington - The House Monday night narrowly defeated
an amendment that would have banned the sale of
livestock so sick or injured they must be dragged to
market, mostly dairy cows that are slaughtered for
meat after they can no longer produce milk. The vote
was 202-199. Voting for the measure were 150
Democrats, 48 Republicans and one independent; voting
against were 162 Republicans and 40 Democrats.
 
In a lively debate earlier in the day, the amendment's
sponsor, Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., noted that fast
food chains like Wendy's, Burger King and McDonald's
don't accept meat from "downed animals," and that the
Agriculture Department prohibits it in the federal
school lunch program. The USDA estimates 130,000
"downers" are brought to slaughterhouses every year.
 
But Texas Rep. Charlie Stenholm, the top Democrat on
the House Agriculture Committee, said that Ackerman
displayed an ignorance of farming. "The gentleman does
not understand the cattle business," said Stenholm,
his thick Texas drawl contrasting sharply with
Ackerman's New York City accent. "I may not be in the
cattle business, but I can tell a good steak when I
see one," Ackerman responded. "This does not a good
steak make." He also called the practice inhumane.
Stenholm said that laws and regulations on the books
already prevent animals from being "inhumanely
handled" before slaughter. "Now there are differences
of opinion as to what is inhumanely handled,"
Stenholm. "I respect those who have a different
opinion than I have."

Lockyer tells them to avoid intelligence on religious, political groups
without clear suspicion

California law-enforcement officers are getting new marching orders in
combating terrorism: Don't collect intelligence on religious and political
activities without clear suspicion that people or groups are involved in a
crime.
...
Justice Department attorneys plan to give examples as an illustration to
intelligence analysts -- such as a protester who lays down in front of a bus.

"That's not something we consider as having any causal relationship or any
factual relationship to terrorism activity," said Peter Siggins, Lockyer's
chief deputy for legal affairs.

"As opposed to a protester who throws a brick through a window," added
Steve Cooney, the deputy attorney general for administration and policy.

"It depends on the window," said Siggins. "We don't see as particularly
terrorist-related someone breaking the front window of Macy's because they
want to protest the fact that they sell fur coats.... To attack that under
the rubric of terrorism is, I think, not right." 
...
Since its inception on Sept. 25, 2001, at a press conference featuring
Gov. Gray Davis and Lockyer, CATIC has issued 30 special advisories that
mention political groups in the Bay Area alone.

In addition to the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front,
which the FBI labels terrorist organizations, CATIC also kept tabs on
Critical Mass, Black Bloc, the Ruckus Society, International ANSWER, Earth
First and nuclear-disarmament groups.

UBS AG is helping Athens control an army of 4,000 stray dogs as the Greek
capital spruces up before holding the 2004 summer Olympics.

UBS, Europe's biggest bank, and Agricultural Bank of Greece have organized
180 million euros ($206 million) in loans for Athens to finance a series
of clean-up measures, including rounding up and sterilizing a canine
population that officials say is out of control.

"We're trying to offer our best hospitality to our visitors and citizens,"
said Athens Deputy Mayor Theodore Skylakakis in an interview. "The dogs
are a nuisance."
...
The number of dogs roaming Athens may be as high as 150,000, said Neil
Trent, executive director of the Gaithersburg, Maryland- based Humane
Society International. That's because many Greeks are "happy to allow
their pets to wander around the streets," he said.
...
Animal rights groups and individuals from Singapore to Belgium sent
petitions to local and national government officials, prompting the
introduction of an animal welfare law that's considered one of the
toughest in the world, according to Carol McBeth, the director of the
Greek Animal Welfare fund.

"They were inundated with e-mail from people concerned about locking up
and poisoning animals," said McBeth, whose group was established in 1959.
The fund is a member of a coalition of 26 animal welfare associations that
are working with the government.

Athens now plans to build shelters to hold ownerless pooches, which will
be sterilized and vaccinated before being released back onto streets or
into parks if not claimed within a few days. Under the animal welfare law
passed by parliament this month, owners will be required to register and
microchip their dogs and will be prosecuted if found abandoning or abusing
their pets.

Cats are not covered by the new legislation.

Here's a tip that vegetarians and savvy menu planners have been sitting on
for more than a decade. And it's a good one.

What if you could indulge in all your favourite foods such as nachos,
pizza, spaghetti sauce, burritos, deli sandwiches, bacon and chicken
fingers, but with a fraction of the saturated fats, calories and
cholesterol usually associated with those foods?

What would you say to a juicy, delicious burger with 12 grams of protein
but less than 100 calories and one gram of fat? Impossible? Not if you
replace animal-based meats with meat alternatives.

If the words "meat alternative" conjure images of bland, blobby tofu and
side trips to the health food store, here's welcome news: your local
supermarket has a full range of meat substitutes fashioned to replicate
the taste and texture of bacon, pepperoni, ground round and chicken strips
? but without the heart-unhealthy cholesterol and fat.
...
"One misconception (about veggie meats) regards taste," says Kurtis
Hooley, managing director of Hain Celestial Canada, the parent company of
Vancouver-based Yves Veggie Cuisine.

Yves ? which supplies McDonald's Canada with McVeggie burgers, and hotdog
stands with jumbo veggie dogs ? is North America's leading supplier of
packaged, soy-based mock meats.

"Meat alternatives have come a long way and many consumers remember
tasting tofu years ago and believe soy-based meat alternatives will taste
the same," Hooley adds. "All tofu is soy but not all soy is tofu."
...
Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)
recommends faux meats and its Golden Bun awards recognize the best in
veggie burgers.

PETA pegs annual sales of veggie burgers in the U.S. at about $300
million, which may be a drop in the bucket compared to the billion-dollar
fast food industry. Yves pegs the meat alternative market in Canada at $33
million.

Nevertheless, many marquee chains, including Burger King, Harvey's and
McDonald's, now offer veggie burgers. Even mom-and-pop carnivore havens
like Toronto's Apache Burger and Dangerous Dan's have the veggie option.

A little lesson in ruminant physiology: Ruminants, animals like cattle,
sheep, deer, elk, goats and llamas are able to digest plant fiber. They
are vegetarian by design.

This ability is because of a four-compartment stomach that includes a
large fermentation vat called the rumen. Rumination involves swallowing
grass, soaking and mixing it in the fluid rumen contents, regurgitating a
cud, rechewing it, reswallowing it and belching off huge quantities of
carbon dioxide and methane over and over and over.

We, as humans, are not able to digest similar fibrous vegetation, like
lettuce, for example. That is why people on diets eat lettuce. Other than
a vitamin or two, it has no nutritional value. Which is somehow deemed
eating healthy. Eating healthy, in this case, is the nutritional
equivalent of not eating, or eating cardboard, tree bark or styrofoam
peanuts, which we would do if we had to, to avoid not eating.
...
Gary, a reliable scientist, has said that people crave 3 things: salt,
chocolate and fat. Lettuce, collard greens and celery finished further on
down the list, I assume. Which just shows you the masochistic
determination required to be a dieting vegetarian. To eat a hubcap full of
lettuce with no Thousand Island, no croutons, no grated cheese, no bacon
bits, no seasoned salt and no hot fudge would demand a real commitment to
the cause.

A cow, the natural vegetarian, is much less discriminating but, of course,
it seldom is able to select from a menu of the five basic food groups.

Although civil libertarians praise Attorney General Bill Lockyer for
denouncing spying on political protest groups, activists now say his
reforms don't go far enough.

Lockyer pledged to remind California's80,000 law enforcement officers that
civil disobedience is not terrorism and only a "reasonable suspicion" of
criminal activity justifies gathering information about political or
religious groups. 
...
Before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, state criminal intelligence analysts
rarely warned local police and sheriffs about protests.

But the state's anti-terror center, created two weeks after the attacks,
began sending out protest warnings within 45 days, tapping the Web, the
FBI and colleagues in other states for information about protesters. They
sometimes suggested that police spy on activists and report back. 
...
In early April, CATIC quoted threatening statements purportedly by a
former spokesman for the Earth Liberation Front, an underground
eco-sabotage group that the FBI classifies as a domestic terrorist
organization. The former ELF spokesman called for attacks on government,
military and corporate interests by "any means necessary."

CATIC analysts concluded that "protesters at past demonstrations with
causes similar to those expressed by ELF, ALF (the Animal Liberation
Front) and anti-war adherents have committed violent crimes to further
their beliefs," and warned law enforcement to expect activists and
"anarchists willing to commit acts of violence."

Three days later, CATIC again blended the former ELF spokesman's talk of
military targets into a warning about a Direct Action to Stop the War
protest at the Concord Naval Weapons Station. CATIC warned the U.S. Coast
Guard and the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department of "potential
violence" at the Concord weapons station.

Direct Action organizer David Solnit called the bulletin "a hit piece" and
"a waste of taxpayer dollars."

ELF experts such as Skidmore College sociology professor Rik Scarce said
the analysis shows a fundamental misunderstanding of such groups.

"To lump together public protesters who don't violate the law at all with
folks whose entire tactical approach is stealth, to get in underneath any
sort of surveillance, do damage and get out, is just beyond belief," said
Scarce, author of "Eco Warriors: Understanding the Radical Environmental
Movement."

THE McDonald's Corporation wants to be everywhere that children are.

So besides operating 13,602 restaurants in the United States, it has
plastered its golden arches on Barbie dolls, video games, book jackets and
even theme parks.

McDonald's calls this promotion and brand extension. But, a growing number
of nutritionists call it a blitzkrieg that perverts children's eating habits
and sets them on a path to obesity.

Marketing fast food, snacks and beverages to children is at least as old as
Ronald McDonald himself. What's new, critics say, is the scope and intensity
of the assault. Big food makers like McDonald's and Kraft Foods Inc. are
finding every imaginable way to put their names in front of children. And
they're spending more than ever - $15 billion last year, compared with $12.5
billion in 1998, according to research conducted at Texas A&amp;M University in
College Station.

"What really changed over the last decade is the proliferation of electronic
media," says Susan Linn, a psychologist who studies children's marketing at
Harvard's Judge Baker Children's Center. "It used to just be
Saturday-morning television. Now it's Nickelodeon, movies, video games, the
Internet and even marketing in schools."

The state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) determined that 
botulism caused 70 geese and ducks to die at local retention basins. "It's 
avian botulism, which is [caused by] a [bacterium]," said Jack Kaskey, a DEP 
spokesman, Friday. "It is not a health threat to people." 

The determination came from blood samples investigators took from sick birds 
at the 3 basins near Delsea Drive and Sarah Place.  The basins, which are 3 
feet deep, are located behind Lilliston Ford and Luther Acres, a senior 
housing complex.

The birds' deaths last week prompted concerns and a DEP investigation. 
Kaskey said conditions in the shallow basins were perfect for fostering 
increased levels of the bacteria, noting that botulism naturally occurs in 
bodies of water.

Berlin &#x2014; Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who as Soviet leader presided over the troops 
and tanks that guarded the Iron Curtain, now wants a nature reserve along 
the full length of the former cold war border, from Finland to the Adriatic. 
German and other European environmental groups have devised a plan to create 
nature parks out of the no man's land that separated the Soviet bloc from 
the West.

Kept forcibly free of people during more than 40 years of the cold war, the 
border between Eastern and Western Europe became a refuge for plants and 
animals. Construction in the region now threatens these unintentional but 
important nature reserves, environmentalists fear. "Ecology isn't something 
we can only leave to politicians," Mr. Gorbachev, who is president of the 
environmental organization Green Cross International, said when lending his 
support to the project at a recent conference in Bonn.

Environmentalists stress that the reserve would not simply be the area it 
covered or the number of endangered species it contained but also that it 
would link many different groups of organisms, known as biotopes, in the 
longest continuous stretch of undeveloped land left in central Europe.

A team of at least 80 investigators yesterday intensified the probe of
last week's $20 million arson fire in University City, and officials say
they hope to know within days how the fire was set.
...
The investigation is focusing on the militant group Earth Liberation
Front, said Dan Dzwilewski, the FBI's special agent in charge of the San
Diego office. A banner reading "If you build it, we will burn it," with
the initials "E.L.F.," was found at the site Friday. An e-mail sent from
the group to The San Diego Union-Tribune later that day stated the banner
"is a legitimate claim of responsibility by the Earth Liberation Front."
...
At the scene yesterday, reaction to the fire was mixed.

"I think it's a positive statement that at least someone somewhere is
trying to point out that the overdevelopment is clogging our already
congested urban areas," said Richard Marose, 41, a restaurant manager who
lives in a nearby apartment complex. 
...
"I'm all for protecting the environment, but not in a way like that,"
Olson said. "It could have easily spread to the apartments. It could have
killed many people with only a change in the wind."

Authorities are urging anyone with information about the fire to call the
FBI at (858) 565-1255, or Crime Stoppers at (619) 235-8477. 
...
Marose said ATF agents contacted him at home Sunday night. He said he
didn't know why and had refused to talk to them.

Marose said he had nothing to do with Friday's fire.

Asked about the potential for death or injury in the fire, Marose said,
"That's the price of war: collateral damage. . . . This is a war to
protect the environment, to raise the consciousness of people."

Marose was not alone in his views.

A small hand-printed sign taped to a nearby traffic barrier read:

"Thank-You E.L.F. Burn Baby Burn."

These [genetically engineered] products are absolutely safe. For the most
part you wouldn't know [if you were eating them] but the point being that
you wouldn't need to know.

- Bryan Hurley,

Monsanto spokesperson

There is a great deal of controversy about the safety of genetically
engineered foods. Advocates of biotechnology often say that the risks are
overblown. "There have been 25,000 trials of genetically modified crops in
the world, now, and not a single incident, or anything dangerous in these
releases," said a spokesman for Adventa Holdings, a UK biotech firm.
During the 2000 presidential campaign, then-candidate George W. Bush said
that "study after study has shown no evidence of danger." And Clinton
Administration Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that "test after
rigorous scientific test" had proven the safety of genetically engineered
products.

Is this the case? Unfortunately not, according to a senior researcher from
the Union of Concerned Scientists, Dr. Jane Rissler. With a Ph.D. in plant
pathology, four years of shaping biotechnology regulations at the EPA, she
is one of the nation's leading authorities on the environmental risks of
genetically engineered foods. Dr. Rissler has been closely monitoring the
trials and studies. 
...
GE Crops Can't Be Contained

A test conducted by the Wall Street Journal found that 16 of 20 vegetarian
foods labeled as being "free" of genetically engineered products actually
contained GE soybeans. As Arran Stephens, president of Nature's Path
Foods, noted: "You cannot build a wall high enough" to prevent genetic
pollution of wild and organic crops.

In August, a team of Belgian researchers were surprised to discover that
Monsanto's GE soybeans contained "a DNA segment... for which no sequence
homology could be detected." "No one knows what this extra gene sequence
is [or]... what its effects will be," said Greenpeace-UK's Doug Parr. "If
Monsanto did not even get this most basic information right, what should
we think about the validity of all their safety tests?"

  FYI on the Responsible Pet Owners' Alliance or RPOA in San Antonio-
While the animal control facility, I've personally observed, is far from 
perfect and the city of San Antonio certainly does kill a terrible 
number of animals, there's probably a good reason why the RPOA has been 
ousted- the RPOA is a far right-wing breeder group that ardently opposes 
animal rights and whose motto used to be "preserving our historical 
relationship w/ animals".  
I run Southern Animal Rescue Association - http://www.sarasanctuary.org 
- a sanctuary for dogs, cats, and farm animals, and I have personally 
been the object of vilification by this group's president Mary Beth 
Duerler who has branded me as a radical animal rights activist.  I once 
asked the RPOA for help in rescuing and placing over two hundred dogs 
and cats (purebred of course) from a wretched puppy mill situation near 
San Antonio, they declined and ultimately supported the puppy mill owner.  
SARA is opposed to breeding animals and we promote veganism and for 
those reasons we are considered a threat to the RPOA and to hear them 
tell it all society at large!
The RPOA supports and indeed extolls breeding of dogs and cats as well 
as "boutique pets" like sugar gliders, hedgehogs, reptiles, ferrets, 
etc. They support rodeos and they think that the endangered species list 
should be done away with- among other things.   
I'm certain Animal Defense League and the San Antonio SPCA will do a 
much better job at placing these animals than a bunch of breeders who go 
to the pound to scrounge for those "purebred" dogs and cats while 
allowing the others to be killed.  The ADL and the SPCA help all dogs 
and cats regardless of a ridiculous pedigree.

I'll make this short and as sweet as possible.  Our president (RPOA), Mary Beth, has apparently decided to bow out of the fight against San Antonio animal control and their decision to ban all purebred rescuers on RPOA's list.  Maybe I should re-phrase that to say FORMER RPOA members, because I think if we don't make a stand here and now there won't be any more RPOA.   I'm asking ALL members to plan on showing up on the steps of San Antonio City Hall this coming Thursday, at 11:00 a.m. to participate in a protest demonstration aimed directly at animal control.   If a news crew shows up (and I think at least one will) I will act as spokesperson for this demonstration.  No one needs to speak on camera if you don't want to.  So far I only have a handful of rescuers who've said they'll definitely be there.  Does that mean only a handful of people care about the future of purebred dogs in San Antonio?  Better think about it.  So far today I've received three calls from people who've called ADL and the Humane Society in hopes of turning in their purebred dogs    -- and ALL of those people were told "no" because both facilities are full AND because the Danes are "too big".  Wonderful.

The ?Animal Planet? network has been around and about South Florida for a while looking for dramatic rescues and above-and-beyond efforts to assist stricken critters.
At least twice, the film crew itself became part of the story. And on both occasions, the saved dogs ended up at the Tri-County Humane Society shelter in Boca Raton.
The latest incident was particularly heart wrenching, since it involved major emergency surgery that saved the life of a nearly dead canine, but left him with only three legs.
The rescued dog, Twiggy, is now recuperating in a Tri-County foster home and is doing very well, said Jeannette Christos, founder and CEO of the society. ?He has gained 17 pounds, is very active and gets around as if he still has all fours.? 
?He is sweet and loves kids,? she added. ?He will make someone a wonderful pet and is looking for a good home.?
In June, an ?Animal Planet? camera crew was riding with a Miami Dade animal control officer when they found a stray female dog that had just given birth to a litter of seven pups in a storage shed behind a restaurant.
Ed Hubbard ? who handles rescue calls for Tri-County ? was dispatched to bring the dogs to the shelter. 
Christos said Monday those pups have all been adopted, but the mom ? named Sweetie because of her disposition ? is still available.
As to the latest incident, Chloe Leland, producer and videographer for ?Animal Planet,? was again riding with a Miami animal control officer to film an animal abuse case in that city. On their way, they spotted an injured dog walking on the side of the road. The dog could barely walk and hadn?t eaten in a long time.
They picked up the dog and took it to Tri-County, where Dr. Bruce Tannenbaum of Regency Veterinary Clinic examined him. He weighed 37 pounds ? some 40 pounds under normal weight. 
He also took x-rays that showed Twiggy had at one time had a botched surgery on his hip. To walk properly and be free of pain and infection, he determined that Twiggy would have to be seen by a specialist.
?At that point, we called Dr. Kenneth Moore, who practices out of Coral Springs Animal Hospital and is one of the top veterinary surgeons in South Florida,? said Christos. ?We were hoping that there was something Dr. Moore could do to help Twiggy, who was obviously suffering terribly.?
He determined he?d have to amputate a leg, as the damage from the previous surgery was too extensive. Christos immediately wondered how Tri-County ? a non-profit organization ? could pay for it.
Moore solved the dilemma. Saying he did not want to see Twiggy suffer any more, he agreed to perform the surgery for free.
?We couldn?t believe what we were hearing,? said Christos. ?But the more we heard about Dr. Moore, the more we realized that he is not only one of South Florida?s top veterinary surgeons, he also sincerely loves his four-legged patients.?
Dr. Moore performed Twiggy?s three-hour operation, and ?Animal Planet? filmed the entire procedure. Twiggy?s story will air animal programming

 Woodbine fire leaves 31 horses dead
 $3 million blaze sweeps massive racetrack barn
 
 
 Thirty-one thoroughbred racehorses are dead after raging flames engulfed a
 massive horse barn complex at Woodbine Racetrack in the early morning
 darkness yesterday.
 
 Scores more horses bolted the inferno. And as the $3 million fire ? the
 second to hit the same complex in 12 years ? quickly turned the
 northwestern Etobicoke track into a sea of chaos, frantic grooms and
 trainers struggled to herd the panicked animals to safety.
 
 "All I thought was I had to care for my animals," said groom Ernest
 Tambwe, who risked his life to free 56 horses from the flames. Tambwe, who
 was being treated for smoke inhalation in hospital after his ordeal, said
 he never paused to think of his own safety.
 
 "I was hired to look after the horses and that's what I did," the 38-year-
 old said, speaking through an oxygen mask.
 
 Woodbine officials said today that 29 horses had died in the fire. Five
 injured horses were sent to the Ontario Veterinary Hospital in Guelph,
 where two more died.ws.org

If doctors had to identify the deadliest sin affecting Americans today,
they would probably name gluttony as the No. 1 killer. As obesity in the
United States reaches epidemic proportions, with more than 60 percent of
adults weighing in as overweight or obese, public policy makers and health
officials are scrambling over ways to improve the American diet.

But Dr. Don Colbert, physician and nutritionist, thinks the obesity crisis
could be solved if Americans would pause before inhaling a super-sized
fast food meal and ask themselves a simple question: "Would Jesus eat this?"
...
And Colbert's not the only Christian diet guru urging people to ask what
Jesus would eat. Christian advocates of vegetarianism say if Jesus were
alive today, he would maintain a plant-based diet out of compassion for
animals. Others say Jesus would probably approve of genetically modified
food, given his propensity for transforming and multiplying food. "He was
clearly not against the need to alter and change food," said Arthur
Caplan, chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of
Pennsylvania, referring to Jesus' tranformation of water into wine and his
multiplying the loaves and fishes.

Suspicions raised over another death
'Blunt impact' killed veteran, 81, who had hired Michelle Knotek as 
caregiver
RAYMOND -- James McClintock, an 81-year-old Pearl Harbor veteran who often 
rode his motorized wheelchair to the grocery store, needed a caregiver. So 
he hired Michelle Knotek.

Six months later, McClintock died from an unexplained blow to the head, 
leaving Knotek $5,000, his home and his beloved dog, Sissy.

...

Yesterday, authorities said the couple's three daughters had also suffered 
abuse at the hands of their parents, and the Department of Health and Social 
Services began poring over its records to try to learn more about Michelle 
Knotek.

From April 2000 to June 2001, Knotek worked at the Olympic Area Agency on 
Aging in Aberdeen where she provided information and social services 
referrals before managers asked her to leave, said David Beatty, the 
agency's director.

The non-profit organization serves seniors and vulnerable adults in Clallam, 
Jefferson, Grays Harbor and Pacific counties.

McClintock was a client at the agency, where he received help with general 
issues, such as navigating Medicare, but he did not qualify for in-home 
care, Beatty said.

Sometime in September 2001, McClintock hired Michelle Knotek to care for 
him. During that same time, records show, McClintock wrote a will, leaving 
his home, his dog and some money to Knotek, whom he listed as a "friend."

Then, in February 2002, McClintock died from "blunt impact to the head," 
according to his death certificate. Michelle Knotek, who had called 911 that 
day, said McClintock fell, though a local doctor who examined McClintock's 
body ruled the manner of death "undetermined."

Michele Knotek received Sissy and at least $5,000 with which to take care of 
the dog. McClintock loved the black dog with skinny white legs so much that 
he wanted Sissy buried next to him.

Once the dog died, Michelle Knotek was deeded McClintock's $140,000 home, 
which is now up for sale.
....





Cruelty to animals is one of the most significant vices of a low and ignoble 
people.

Man charged with assaulting girlfriend; killing kitten


BELLEVUE -- A 25-year-old Bellevue man has been charged with first-degree 
animal cruelty, a felony, for killing his girlfriend's 6-week-old kitten in 
what prosecutors said was a drunken rage.

Arturo "Art" Federico was also charged on Wednesday with fourth-degree 
assault, a misdemeanor. King County prosecutors said he pushed his 
20-year-old girlfriend around, choked her and then locked her out of the 
apartment they shared.

He is being held at the King County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail, Dan 
Donohoe, spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's Office, said Wednesday.

Federico was arrested about 3:30 a.m. Sunday, shortly after he ran from the 
apartment as police arrived, said Bellevue police spokeswoman Marcia 
Harnden.

A K-9 officer and a police dog, Bosco, gave chase. They caught Federico in a 
cemetery behind the apartment building, Harnden said. Bosco bit Federico's 
head during the arrest, so he was taken to Overlake Hospital Medical Center 
for stitches.

Federico's girlfriend told police that he began drinking around 10 p.m. 
Saturday, according to court documents. An hour later, she saw him "hold the 
kitten in both hands and throw the kitten down (on the bed) with what 
appeared to be all of his strength," then pick up the cat and throw it down 
again.

When she confronted him, he "began to yell (that) the kitten had scratched 
his eye," she told police. Twenty minutes later, Federico began pushing and 
choking her before locking her out of the apartment.

She was able to get back inside an hour later, only to find her kitten, Mr. 
Sampson, dead.

Federico previously had threatened to kill the kitten, she told police. The 
kitten had suffered other injuries. Federico explained to her that he'd 
accidentally opened a door on the cat, and in another instance, the kitten 
had jumped into an oven.

Jon Zwickel wanted to create the ultimate B.C. hot dog. Hence the world has 
the PNE Salmon Sausage, a new taste treat that will be unveiled when the 
Pacific National Exhibition opens Saturday morning.

"There's nothing more West Coast than salmon," said Zwickel, who runs Hot 
Dog Jonny's restaurants in the West End and Ambleside.

"We put together dozens and dozens of different permutations, different 
grinds, different blends, different herbs, different spices, different 
flavourings. This turned out to be the perfect one. It has wild B.C. salmon 
flavoured with fresh ginger, soy and a touch of wasabi."

The PNE Salmon Sausage is emblematic of the changing times at Vancouver's 
fair, which runs from Saturday through Monday, Sept. 1. It's one of the 
PNE's three unofficial food groups -- hot dogs, hamburgers, and mini-donuts 
-- but it is more of an upscale 21st-century snack than traditional fare 
food.</docText>

The Japanese call it bazashi, a toothsome treat served raw, with
chives, ginger, garlic and onion. Italians boast of pastissado de
caval, a succulent stew, while the Swiss savor fondue bourguignonne.

It is also popular with more than a few French, Belgian, German,
Romanian, Kazakh and Chinese gastronomes. Tongans, too -- including
those who brought the festive dish to Utah -- relish it roasted,
shredded and basted in coconut milk, or spiced with curry.

Horse.

In many lands, it's what's for dinner.

But don't go looking for filets of Flicka or the makings of
Seabiscuit Bisque or Seattle Slew Stew from local grocery stores or
meat retailers. While two foreign-owned slaughterhouses in Texas
annually ship an estimated 20,000 tons of horse flesh to diners
abroad -- among them more than a few animals from Utah -- most
Americans have no hankering for horse. 
...
So, where does one get horse meat in Utah? Afeaki and others in the
Tongan community say it is strictly a do-it-yourself proposition.
Purchases are made privately, usually from small auctions or a farm
or ranch trying to sell an old or broken-down animal; preparation,
too, is a quiet affair.

Usually, that is that, though occasionally an incident occurs that
makes authorities aware of the practice -- like the horse's head and
hooves found tossed over a West Valley City fence a year and a half
ago, says John Fox, an animal-cruelty investigator with the Utah
Humane Society. 
...
Proponents of the U.S. horse-slaughter ban debate just how "humane"
the final moments of the animals' lives can be, claiming some horses
-- despite being shot in the head -- are still living when hoisted by
their hooves to have their throats slit.

It is a claim the industry denies and points out no slaughterhouse is
ever a pleasant environment, whether the animals being killed and
processed are cattle, pork, chickens, turkeys -- or horses.

And, unless Congress passes a ban, horses in the United States will
continue to be slaughtered for overseas tables.

Wolves staking claims
in White Clouds

After a one-year hiatus, gray wolves have returned to the White Cloud 
Mountains, renewing a debate in central Idaho over how huge tracts of 
federal land in and around the region are managed.

Ketchum resident Jack Corrock measures his right hand against one of 
hundreds of wolf prints set in a muddy pond bed adjacent to Squaw Creek, in 
Custer County. The prints were left by members of the Buffalo Ridge Pack, 
which was seen repeatedly last spring near Clayton before moving into the 
highlands. Express photo by Willy Cook

Wolf advocates have applauded a federal ruling this year that prohibits 
federal officials from killing wolves that prey on livestock in the Sawtooth 
National Recreation Area, which includes the White Clouds. At the same time, 
many object to grazing permits that allow thousands of sheep and cattle to 
be placed in proximity of known wolf dens in the 756,000-acre SNRA.

DNA fingers the dog, but did she murder the chickens? 

It wasn't the island's most gruesome crime: Similar massacres have occurred in 
the past. But for a few weeks on Martha's Vineyard this summer as rumors 
swirled and accusations flew, it seemed the whole island was obsessed by the 
question: Who killed Mal Jones' chickens? Partly it was the horrific nature of the 
crime body parts and feathers strewn all over the bloodied coop. Partly it was 
the accused. Sabrina, a beautiful 2?-year-old malamute-collie mix has a 
silvery tan coat and deep brown eyes that radiate friendliness, not murderous 
intent. But mainly the crime grabbed attention because for the first time, in these 
parts anyway, DNA was used by the prosecution to implicate a dog. Hair from 
the coop matched that of Sabrina. But was that enough to convict her of the 
alleged murder of seven chickens a crime punishable by death for dogs in these 
parts? 

Magid offered to settle the matter by paying for the chickens viewing it 
as a form of compensation for the trouble Sabrina's family had caused in the 
past. But she refused to pay the $400 DNA bill, saying circumstantial evidence 
did not make Sabrina a killer. Selectmen meetings are held in an old gray 
clapboard building and are generally relaxed and friendly: The secretary passes 
around raspberry and lemon tarts before they begin. But even the tarts couldn't 
mask the tension on July 16. Inside, Jones and his daughter sat grimly on the 
public bench. Outside Sabrina dozed in her owner's van, awaiting her fate. 
Aggressive animal complaints are among the most difficult issues to come before 
the board, whose members own dogs and chickens themselves. ''The dog cannot 
defend itself, and owners never want to believe their pets are vicious,'' said 
John Early, chairman of the Board of Selectmen. ''So it really boils down to us 
making a life-or-death decision.'' In Sabrina's case, they voted 2-1 for life 
at least for now. It seemed an audible sigh of relief swept the room. The board 
simply approved Jenkinson's recommendation that Magid pay a $200 bond to be 
returned after a year if Sabrina doesn't get into trouble again. Magid also 
wrote Jones a check for $375 covering half the DNA testing and $25 per chicken. 
And Sabrina was given a stern warning: Any more chicken attacks and she would 
meet the same fate as Betty Blue. She was also slapped with a lifetime 
restraining order. Meaning, of course, she must be leashed at all times.

Excerpts from Earth Policy News "CHINA LOSING WAR WITH ADVANCING DESERTS"
(Lester R. Brown)

 "....Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never
will......"
-  Frederick Douglass, Conference in Canandaigua, NY, 1857

 ...............China is now at war. It is not invading armies that are
claiming its
 territory, but expanding deserts. Old deserts are advancing and new ones
are
 forming, like guerrilla forces striking unexpectedly, forcing Beijing to
 fight on several fronts. And worse, the growing deserts are gaining
momentum,
occupying an ever-larger piece of China's territory each
year.....Overplowing
and overgrazing are converging to create a dust bowl of historic
 dimensions. With little vegetation remaining in parts of northern and
 western China, the strong winds of late winter and early spring can remove
 literally millions of tons of topsoil in a single day--soil that can take
 centuries to replace................A report by a U.S. embassy official in
May 2001
after a visit to Xilingol Prefecture in Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol) notes
that
although 97 percent of the region is officially classified as grasslands, a
third of the terrain
 now appears to be desert. The report says the prefecture's livestock
 population climbed from 2 million as recently as 1977 to 18 million in
2000.
 A Chinese scientist doing grassland research in the prefecture says that
if
 recent desertification trends continue, Xilingol will be uninhabitable in
15
 years........... In the deteriorating relationship between the global
economy and the earth's
 ecosystem, China is on the leading edge. A human population of 1.3 billion
 and a livestock population of just over 400 million are weighing heavily
on
 the land. Huge flocks of sheep and goats in the northwest are stripping
the
 land of its protective vegetation, creating a dust bowl on a scale not
seen
 before. Northwestern China is on the verge of a massive ecological
meltdown.........While overplowing is now being partly remedied by paying
farmers to plant
 their grainland in trees, overgrazing continues largely unabated. China's
 cattle, sheep, and goat population tripled from 1950 to 2002. The United
 States, a country with comparable grazing capacity, has 97 million cattle.
 China has 106 million. But for sheep and goats, the figures are 8 million
 versus 298 million. Concentrated in the western and northern provinces,
 sheep and goats are destroying the land's protective vegetation. The wind
 then does the rest, removing the soil and converting productive rangeland
 into desert.

Protect dog -- and yourself -- from infected insects
THE BOND Pet owners can take steps to reduce possibility of dangerous bites 
from disease-carrying bugs, Dr. Marty Becker says.


The pandemic diseases that have been in the news lately -- SARS and 
monkeypox, for instance -- seem to have been conjured by a science fiction 
writer.

But in reality, pandemics are not new at all, as we have always been in a 
complex dance with disease organisms.

These diseases have been of particular interest to pet owners because of how 
they may directly or indirectly be passed from animals to humans, a 
phenomenon known as zoonosis.

Zoonotic infections are not new and will not diminish soon. We live in a 
global village, with animals and people existing in close quarters and, in 
many places around the world, highly unsanitary conditions.

Dogs, cats, horses, parrots and many other animals can be carriers of the 
more than 150 known zoonotic diseases that can affect humans through bites, 
scratches, contaminated water and tainted food supplies.

Yet it's important to keep things in perspective, to understand the risks 
and keep a watchful eye, but not overreact in such a way that you're unable 
to enjoy your pet.

Fall is time to see bighorns in Hells Canyon
Out &amp; About


A herd of 18 bighorn sheep wanders along the banks of the Snake River in 
Hells Canyon, moseying from rock to rock, drinking from the river, and 
chewing on grass.

Five rams, with massive horns curling over the sides of their heads, are in 
the herd.

What a sight.

A lamb bounds playfully but cautiously between the adult animals.

............

Wild sheep disappeared from Hells Canyon by the 1940s as a result of 
disease, overhunting and competition with domestic sheep for forage.

Idaho was home to about 100,000 bighorn sheep in the early 1800s. There are 
an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 today.

Bighorn numbers started to decline as soon as the state began to be settled. 
They were easy to hunt and provided food for early miners and settlers. And 
they were -- and still are -- susceptible to diseases like scabies and 
pasturella, which are transmitted from domestic sheep.

As homesteaders brought in more domestic sheep, the bighorns became sick and 
died.

"The bottom line is there is no danger to domestic sheep from wild sheep," 
Cassirer says. "It's only one way."

The main solution now is to keep bighorns and domestic sheep separated.

Southern ocean hunt for ship with cargo of endangered toothfish


South Africa joined a dramatic international hunt for an Uruguayan fishing 
vessel yesterday which is believed to have illegally poached millions of 
pounds worth of rare Patagonian toothfish in Australian waters.
The Viarsa, which has ignored repeated radio orders, has been hunted for 
more than 1,000 miles, mostly through snowstorms and strong gales, by the 
Australian customs ship Southern Supporter.

It is one of the most dangerous and tenacious maritime pursuits for years.

The Australian authorities insisted yesterday that they would not give up 
the chase, which began 10 days ago after the Viarsa was spotted near Heard 
Island, one of the richest known grounds for the endangered fish.

It is skirting icebergs as it flees west across the Southern Ocean in 
mountainous seas.

Last night it was understood that the chase had reached South African 
waters, and that the Viarsa was 1,380 miles south of Cape Town. The Southern 
Supporter is now working with the South African environment ministry, which 
sent the research ship SA Agulhas, a helicopter-equipped icebreaker, to 
intercept the Viarsa yesterday.

Last night Ian Macdonald, the Australian fisheries minister, said the Viarsa 
was suspected of carrying a full load of toothfish.

"We will do whatever it takes, no matter how long it takes, to see that the 
vessel is thoroughly investigated," he said. His spokesman added: "South 
Africa has expressed a willingness to help us and we are working with other 
countries, too, to stop this boat."

Chinchillas are endangered due to exploitation of the 
animal for fur. Protected wild populations continue 
to decline. Its habitat is threatened by human land 
alterations in north central Chile. Without funds, research 
and conservation wild populations will be extinct in 
the near future. 

Chinchillas are originally gray in color with a small 
squirrel-like body, large mouse-like ears and a bushy 
tail. The characteristic that they are best known for is 
their plush fur. Where humans have one hair from each 
follicle, a chinchilla has more than 50 hairs from a 
single follicle. An adult chinchilla weighs between 400 
and 500 grams. Two species of chinchillas are recognized 
as: Chinchilla brevicaudata (Blue Bolivian Chinchilla), 
and Chinchilla lanigera (Lanigera). 

Exploitation for the fur trade to markets in Europe and 
North America started by the onset of the 19th century and 
demand for the pelts continues today. Requiring a hundred 
pelts per coat, this fur is among the most expensive and 
rarest in the world. "In 1928, a coat made of Bolivian pelts 
cost half a million gold marks". In 1992, a chinchilla fur 
coat cost $22,000. 


The chinchilla population declined steadily because of 
hunting and trapping. At the end of the nineteenth century, 
the once abundant animals had become endangered. Humans were 
hunting and trapping the animal for its fur faster than 
the animal could repopulate themselves resulting in scarcity 
of the species. By 1918 Chile had laws against trapping the animal.
Now that populations have increased, poaching has increased
again as well. As the latest fad pet in the U.S., wild 
chinchilla from Chile or Bolivia have become a prize possession.
An individual chinchilla can fetch $700 from frenzied buyers.
Often half of the chinchilla smuggled out of these countries die 
enroute to the States. Steps must be taken to stop the decimation
of the wild populations before they truly become another
creature hunted to exinction.

WORLD ANIMAL DAY

We are planning a blessing of the animals celebration of World 
Animal Day, Saturday 4th October, in St Leonards Park, corner of 
Miller and Falcon Streets, North Sydney, from 11am to 3.30pm.

Rev Bill Crews of the Ashfield Uniting Church is most 
enthusiastic about joining Father Dan Donovan in officiating.

We'll make a day of it, with kindred groups holding information 
stalls and vegan food available.

Final details will be available in a week or so. Please ring the 
office (02) 9264 3222 or email sydneyhq@animal-lib.org.au for 
enquiries.

- - -

To also mark World Animal Day, we are holding stalls at 20 
railway stations on the City Rail Network on Friday 3 October, 
7am to 7pm. If you can help at whichever station is convenient for 
you, if only for an hour or so, it will be much appreciated. These 
venues are free and this opportunity for 'outreach' to hundreds, if 
not thousands of commuters comes only once a year.

STATEMENT FROM THE SAVE WILD ELEPHANTS COALITION

U.S. ZOOS WIN - BUT WILD ELEPHANTS LOSE

Appeals Court declines to stop shipment of young African 
elephants from Swaziland elephants taken from wild to be 
confined to small enclosures forever.

(Washington, DC) - Today the United States District Court of 
Appeals denied an emergency appeal for a temporary stay to 
prevent the San Diego Zoo and Lowry Park Zoo of Tampa, FL 
from immediately importing eleven wild African elephants from 
their homes in Swaziland. The members of the Save Wild 
Elephants Coalition, including Born Free USA, Born Free 
Foundation, The Elephant Alliance, the Elephant Sanctuary, In 
Defense of Animals, Animal Protection Institute, People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Animal Welfare Institute, 
San Diego Animal Advocates, Animal Legal Defense Fund, and 
others are saddened by the fate that awaits the young elephants, 
two of whom are pregnant. The elephants will be taken from their 
home in Swaziland, where they have lived on more than 7,000 
acres and will now be confined to 2-2.5 acre lots in San Diego 
and Tampa.

This importation sets a dangerous precedent and opens the 
floodgates for the importation of threatened species that are 
protected by national and international laws and treaties. 
Leading wild African elephant researchers and habitat experts, 
including Cynthia Moss, Joyce Poole, Keith Lindsey and others, 
have condemned the import of these elephants - highlighting the 
devastating consequences this import will have on the individual 
elephants, on those left behind in Swaziland, and on African 
elephants in general</docText>

CANNIBAL COWS AND DYING DEER

Mad cow disease has killed more than a hundred people in Great Britain and 
may kill many more. The circumstances that created that epidemic exist right 
here. An infected cow was recently discovered in Canada--but not until after 
it entered the food supply


We all know (or should know) that factory meat farming is violent and 
environmentally destructive. You don't have to be a vegan activist to be 
disturbed by the conditions in which most meat animals live and die. And you 
probably already know that a large percentage of pesticide use, water 
pollution, and groundwater depletion is caused by the intensive cultivation 
of grain used to feed livestock, especially cattle. The environmental damage 
caused by the cattle themselves--the enormous expanses of land required, the 
destruction of native vegetation, the problem of what to do with all that 
poop--has fundamentally altered entire ecosystems. So that every supermarket 
can be packed with cheap beef and milk, every town can have scores of 
fast-food chain restaurants, and most Americans can comfortably participate 
in the fallacy that a meal is not a meal unless it contains meat, we feed, 
pump full of drugs, and confine about 96 million cattle every year. We kill 
about 30 million.

We would all be better off without so much meat. Still, the cattle industry 
has proved as resilient as most Americans are oblivious to the process by 
which that burger came to their table. Despite a decade's worth of bad news 
about beef, the average American still eats 66 pounds [in 1999], and beef 
consumption typically goes way, way up in the summer months. How many 
hamburgers have you had since Memorial Day?

A new player, however, has emerged in this game and could force the issue 
and destroy the multibillion-dollar beef industry: the infective prion, the 
agent that causes mad cow and similar diseases. Unfortunately, prions also 
have the potential to cause human suffering on an enormous scale. The recent 
discovery of mad cow disease in Canada and a good look at the ineffectual 
efforts to avoid it here show that the disease is not far away from us at 
all.


Meat Market Prions

Until the 20th century, most people who ate meat either grew or hunted it 
themselves; the animals you ate lived where you did and ate what they had 
evolved to eat. Now, though, we have the factory meat industry, to which it 
is difcult to offer any compliments. From the near-extermination of 
American buffalo to the return of the low-paying, dangerous slaughterhouse 
job to the present treatment of living creatures as commercial products 
packed in tight boxes and fed everything from cardboard to chicken shit, its 
unsavory history goes back more than 100 years.

Bread. Pasta. Rice. You might blame them for your weight gain. Or you may 
have heard someone blasting them on the news. Contrary to popular belief, 
though, carbohydrates are not necessarily the enemy.

Carbohydrates are found in grains, vegetables and legumes (complex 
carbohydrates) as well as in fruit, milk and other dairy products (simple 
carbohydrates). It's how much you eat of these foods - or any other type of 
food - that matters when it comes to weight gain. "At the end of the day, 
weight gain and loss is a matter of calories. If you eat more calories than 
your body can use - be it from protein, carbohydrate or fat - you will gain 
weight," says Karen Miller-Kovach, MS, RD, Chief Scientist at Weight 
Watchers International.


So why do carbs - and not fat-laden butter or cheese - have such a bad 
reputation? First, carbohydrate-based foods today are often super-sized. 
While a regular Lender's Bagel weighs 2 ounces, many New York-style bagels 
from the corner deli can weigh 4 to 6 ounces, and more. And servings of 
pasta at many restaurants far exceed the 1 to 2 cup portion that should be 
the norm.

Plus, eating a meal that consists mostly of carbohydrates, like pasta with 
tomato sauce, may leave some people feeling hungrier sooner...

.........
Choose a variety of carbohydrates. Fruits, whole grains and vegetables 
contain a wide range of disease-preventing substances. Maximize your health 
quotient by choosing a wide variety of items from these food groups.

Bashing Gophers and Slaughtering Cats and Dogs

Buckner learned that by the time Keith Jesperson was six, he had gotten his 
first taste of killing living things by bashing in the heads of gophers 
while still in British Columbia.  By the time he was twenty, while living 
with his parents in the Washington State trailer park, Keith got his first 
taste of killing larger animals when he began dragging stray dogs and cats 
into a field near the park where he would beat them to death with a shovel, 
strangle them with his bare hands, or shoot them with his BB gun.  He 
discovered that he enjoyed it.

Nowadays, it&#x2019;s no secret that those who have shown a propensity toward 
animal violence and abuse during their younger years sometimes move on to 
more violent crimes later on in life that are directed at human beings.

&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the crime journals of all major law enforcement agencies,&#x201d; 
Jesperson once wrote from his prison cell at Oregon State Penitentiary, 
where he eventually became a permanent resident.  &#x201c;Abusive behavior towards 
animals is one of the symptoms on the road to being a murderer.&#x201d;
More on his animal abuse can be found in I: The Creation of a Serial Killer
by Jack Olsen. Below is an excerpt from a review:

"Olsen lets Keith Hunter Jesperson narrate the whole book from a first 
persons point of view. It is a chilling, brutal, scary tale. Its almost too 
vivid as he describes torturing animals (Animal lovers beware. I'm one and 
its upsetting)"</docText>

HONKED OFF
Washington -- Flocks of Canada geese soon could become sitting ducks.

The federal government proposed Thursday allowing states to kill hundreds of 
thousands of the big, brassy birds that have become an increasing nuisance 
in urban centers, including the Bay Area.

The federally protected birds, which can grow to 14 pounds and live for up 
to 20 years, have found life in urban areas so hospitable that many of them 
no longer bother to follow their species' ancient migration path from Canada 
in the summer to their winter homes in the southern United States and 
Mexico.

It's these resident geese -- whose messy, aggressive and honking behavior 
has prompted a growing chorus of complaints from homeowners, park districts, 
golf courses and suburban business parks -- that are the subject of the 
rules proposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

"It's a difficult problem," said Robert Trost, a biologist with the service 
in Portland. "You've got to balance the desire not to harm wildlife with the 
birds' unchecked growth in our urban environment."

"The geese are like people. They find a nice place to live, and they stay," 
said Fremont Mayor Gus Morrison, who for years has wrestled with a big 
population of Canada geese at Lake Elizabeth, a huge park where the birds 
have found a happy home amid the mowed grass and water and a lack of 
predators.</docText>

At the start of July, Stop Primate Experiments At Cambridge (SPEAC) was set up as the next stage in the campaign to halt to Cambridge Universitys proposed development of the primate research labs on the edge of the city. 

These labs are pointless, unneeded, and will cause untold suffering to the primates imprisoned in them. What is more, nobody in the area other than the University wants it. The public, police and local council have all spoken out against it. A local coalition successfully fought against it through democratic means, so now it has gone to the hands of the pro-animal abuse government. 

Nevertheless, SPEAC will continue the fight to ensure that these labs are never built. We hold the entire University guilty in this matter and are calling on everyone who opposes the primate prison to contact the university and put pressure on them until they do the right thing and cancel the project. 

Each week we will be releasing an action alert, targeting a different university college or department. It does not matter that they may not be directly involved in the building of the labs. What matters is that in Cambridge's ancient and convoluted governing structure, they have a say and can influence the decision-making process. It is up to us all to make sure that they use their power to oppose the laboratories.

To this end, this week we are asking you to contact the top people at St John's College in Cambridge. Be polite, but be firm - these people are not the animal abusers. What is important is making sure your message gets though, that you want them to put pressure on the rest of the university and that we will not give up as long as Cambridge University insist on going ahead with its plans. Ask them to contact the Vice Chancellor, the Senate and other relevant governing bodies on the primate prison issue and then let them know that there will be no peace for the entire university as long as they insist on going down this path. Ask them what they are doing to prevent the primate prison on the A307 being built.

So-called animal rights activists who squeal to authorities
disgust me, and I think one of the major reasons the animal 
freedoms efforts have not made substantial progress is because 
many activists do not picture the truly progressive nature 
of this movement. We're fighting evil, defending the 
defenseless and our very own earth from greed and destruction. 
There is no room for those working both sides of the fence. 
...
We have thousands prepared to take action for us ... 
The offspring of those we fight are enjoying comforts sapped 
from the life and abuse of innocent animals. Why should they be 
allowed to shelter themselves from that and sit in front of their 
TVs and stereos when animals die because of the actions of 
their parents? 
...
I once heard Collie Carnes (director of the Society for the 
Prevention of Mistreatment of Animals or SPOMA) say getting 
arrested is fun.  I can't say that I agree.
...
It is ill-advised to have even the most innocent of discussions
with any law-enforcement, FBI, or Homeland Security agent.

Sept. 26, Alicia Silverstone will make her debut in a new NBC series called 
"Miss Match," which the network hopes will permeate the fashion consciousness 
much in the manner of "Sex and the City," on HBO. Like that series, "Miss 
Match" counts Darren Star as one of its creators and covers the subjects of lust, 
love, misery and renewal, set in a world of overpriced drinks.In the series, 
Ms. Silverstone plays a Los Angeles divorce lawyer who inadvertently begins 
acting as a matchmaker to her clients. For diversion, her character spends 
evenings at a stylish bar modeled after Les Deux Caf?s in Hollywood, which means 
that her wardrobe requirements extend far beyond courtroom tweeds.In fact, 
wardrobe requirements turn out to be fairly complicated. In real life, Ms. 
Silverstone is a vegan whose politics prohibit a great deal more than fur. "She will 
not wear wool," said Roberta Haze, the show's costume designer and a veteran of 
"Sex and the City" and "Veronica's Closet." "It has something to do with the 
way the sheep are treated. Alicia gave me some of the literature explaining it 
all." Silk is also verboten. "But I don't know the whole story with the 
silkworms yet," Ms. Haze said. She has bought Ms. Silverstone stretch-cotton suits 
from Dolce &amp; Gabbana and a corduroy jacket from Fred Segal. Like many animal 
rights activists, Ms. Silverstone is leather-averse, so it has been 
particularly challenging for Ms. Haze to keep her attractively shod. "There are synthetic 
shoes, of course, but there aren't many I like looking at," she said.Ms. Haze 
has worked around the problem, though, offering the star the option of 
vintage shoes from Decades on Melrose Avenue. Because the production of those shoes 
violated animal welfare so long ago, Ms. Silverstone's thinking goes, they are 
permitted through a grandfather clause."She isn't demanding," Ms. Haze said. 
"She brings all of her own special food to the set. I think she's a very 
spiritual girl."

A previously unknown animal rights group on Friday claimed
responsibility for bombing the Emeryville offices of Chiron and
suggested in a brazen communique that it will target the homes of the
biotech company's workers.

The FBI branded Thursday morning's twin bombings an act of domestic
terrorism and is investigating whether the group, which calls itself
the ``Revolutionary Cells'' and the ``Animal Liberation Brigade,'' is
indeed responsible for the attacks.

``You might be able to protect your buildings, but can you protect
the homes of every employee?'' said the statement, which was
anonymously e-mailed to other animal rights organizations and posted
on their Web sites.

The statement went on to call for ``animal liberation through armed
struggle'' and compared the group to others in the Middle East and
Northern Ireland whose ``struggle will continue until all of the
oppressive institutions are destroyed!''
...
Experts who track environmental and animal rights organizations say
that the tone of Friday's communique is far more militant then what
has been seen in the past.

``It sounds like a communist anarchist animal rights group,'' said
Gary Perlstein, a Portland State University criminologist. ``I think
Chiron should take the threat seriously. They are no longer dealing
with little elves in the woods and pranksters. They are starting to
deal with true militant revolutionaries.''
...
Steven Best, an associate professor of philosophy at the University
of Texas-El Paso, agrees that the animal rights movement's more
militant fringes have stepped up their activity.

``I've never seen the phrase `animal liberation through armed
struggle' before,'' said Best, who studies radical politics. ``The
fact that it was a bombing and not arson shows an escalation not just
of rhetoric but tactics.''

Rep. Dennis Kucinich may be a vegetarian, but he is
throwing his crowds plenty of red meat in his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination.

"This administration with its go-it-alone approach has heightened
tensions in the world and created a situation where America is less
safe, not more safe," Kucinich said last week while campaigning in
Pennsylvania. "Corporate control of government is going up; the hand
of corporations is reaching into our electoral process, able to
assure the election of candidates who have nothing in common with the
American people."

Kucinich's hard-edged populism is appealing to liberal voters and
labor union members, many of whom seem receptive to angry messages. 
...
Congressional crusader

"I met a woman and fell in love" is how the divorced Kucinich begins
when asked how he became a vegetarian, a rarity in the carnivorous
world of presidential politics. His friend persuaded him to change
his eating habits, and he became a vegan - one who uses no animal
products whatsoever, including milk and eggs.

He eats organically grown food almost exclusively. He is so committed
that he soaks newly hulled oats overnight so they'll be tender for
breakfast oatmeal.

Kucinich's attentiveness to food extends to food policy. In Congress,
he is the leading proponent of toughening federal regulation of
genetically modified food and labeling the packaging of products with
engineered ingredients.

He attributes his little success so far on the issue to a public
relations and lobbying effort by Monsanto Co. and others in the
biotechnology industry allied with farm organizations and
pharmaceutical companies. </docText>

SPENCER -- Mike and Kathy Warren insist there's no such thing as bad
publicity. Especially when you make your livelihood training piglets
named Hammy Faye Bakker and Elvis Pigsley to race around a small
track and jump into a swimming pool.

The Tampa-based Warrens travel the Northeast as promoters for
Robinson's Racing Pigs and Paddling Porkers, a carnival-type show
featuring a miniature race track for pigs, complete with checkered
flags and starting gates. The show has been a crowd-pleaser at the
fair for nearly a decade. But this weekend, when the Warrens pulled
into town with their eight-pig team, they ran into controversy.

Accusing the Warrens of animal cruelty, the national animal rights
group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals filed a complaint
with Spencer police. The group took particular issue with the
Robinson's newest race innovation, a 24-foot long, 2-foot-deep
swimming tank that the piglets have to swim across before being
rewarded with food pellets or an Oreo cookie.

"I deal all day with animals exploited for entertainment," said Amy
Rhodes, PETA's animals and entertainment specialist. "It still amazes
me the ways people find to exploit animals for just a laugh or to
line their pockets."

A law enforcement officer from the Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reviewed the charge on Thursday, but
after witnessing a mock race, inspecting the horse trailer the pigs
are transported in, and interviewing the Warrens, Sergeant Peter
Oberton found no cause to press charges.

Still, thanks to the PETA complaint and the ensuing media coverage,
this year's pig races have been a bigger draw than ever. At
yesterday's 2 p.m. race, about 125 fair-goers filled a section of
bleachers and encircled the track.</docText>

WASHINGTON ? A terrorist by any other name is still a terrorist, even
when politically correct media outlets refuse to call them such under
claims of maintaining the standards of objectivity.
...
While the duty of the Fourth Estate is to keep the powers that be
honest, the Bush administration is in part to blame for mistaken
language used by the news. The media frequently rely on official
sources to get the information it needs, often using the very
language that is handed to it. When the Bush administration meekly
uses phrases that don't depict reality, it's no wonder that
inaccurate language is repeated.

For instance, the FBI sent out its weekly police bulletin on
Wednesday describing recent activities by sister outlaws the Animal
Liberation Front (search) and Earth Liberation Front (search), groups
that the FBI has called domestic terrorists (search) responsible for
600 acts of violence since 1996. In the bulletin delivered to 18,000
law enforcement authorities, the FBI referred to ALF as "animal
rights activists."

Among the crimes ALF has laid claim to -- torching a barn on an Erie,
Pa., fur farm, setting fire to a Chicago storefront accused of
selling exotic animal hides, and spray-painting the home of a trader
who sells stocks for a holding company that owns an animal testing
lab.

No matter how disgusted one is by animal testing, in what can only be
a bad joke, the animalliberationfront.com (search) provides readers a
how-to lesson on becoming a "cell" and committing violent acts on
one's own. The author says keeping down expenses is first priority in
order to raise funds for supplies, and boasts "my only expense is gas
money."

That should shock ELF, whose eco-terrorism includes the 1998
firebombing of a building at Vail ski resort in Colorado and this
month's arson of a San Diego apartment building said to have caused
$50 million in damage. Last week, the ELF ravaged vehicles at four
car dealerships in San Gabriel Valley, Calif., setting fire to many
of them and defacing others.

Curious, how environmentalists define pollution, yet the Los Angeles
Times defined ELF's actions as the work of "vandals" and "radical
environmentalists."

The San Francisco Chronicle picked up AP, which rehabilitated that
word again, calling ELF "a loose organization of militant
environmentalists." The San Diego Union Tribune borrowed heavily from
other reports, coming up with similar language.

Yes, the media are often preoccupied with saying the right thing in
order to gain access to sources on all sides, and yes, it is equally
abhorrent to make a crisis out of a problem that does not rise to the
level. But trying to play down the dirtiest of deeds with
neutralizing language is an injustice to those victimized by the
deeds.

 FELINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY, CAT - SWITZERLAND
 ************************************************** 
 Mad cat disease
 - ----------------
 A 2nd case of feline spongiform encephalopathy
 (FSE), a disease 
 affecting the brain tissue of cats, has been
 recorded in Switzerland.
 
 The veterinary authorities said the likely cause of
 the infection, which is 
 similar to mad cow disease, was contaminated pet
 food. A 1st case of FSE was 
 reported 2 years ago. Experts say the disease poses
 no health risk for people
 ; 
 [When the identification of FSE was initially
 published by the Bristol 
 Veterinary School in 1990, this was the 1st
 indication that BSE is 
 capable of crossing the species barrier and sparked
 fears that it might 
 affect humans as well. This was confirmed 6 years
 later.
 
 According to DEFRA's BSE-site's update of 30 Jun
 2003, 89 FSE cases have 
 been diagnosed in the UK so far, including 20 since
 1996 (the last one in 
 2001).  Of these 20 cases, 8 could be clearly
 identified as having been 
 born after September 1990 (i.e., the date the ban on
 the use of SBO was 
 extended to any animal feed). 5 additional cases
 have been reported outside 
 the UK, namely N. Ireland, Norway, Liechtenstein
 (one case each), and 
 Switzerland (2 cases, including the current one).
 
 In addition, 21 cases of TSE regarded to be FSE have
 been reported in 
 exotic felids in zoos, their age ranging between 6
 and 17 years. Of those, 
 16 have been recorded in the UK (5 cheetahs, 2
 lions, 3 ocelots, 3 pumas, 
 &amp; 3 tigers). 5 additional cases, in cheetahs, have
 reportedly been 
 identified outside the UK: 1 in Australia (1991; the
 very 1st case 
 diagnosed in a cheetah), 1 in Ireland, &amp; 3 in
 France. 4 of these cases 
 are known to have originated in the UK, while one
 was diagnosed in a 
 cheetah born in France. See under "other TSEs" in
 &lt;http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.html.
 
 A presumptive FSE case in an imported Asian Golden
 Cat in an Australian zoo 
 was reported in August 2002.
 
 Data on the age of the current, 2nd FSE case in
 Switzerland and on the 
 suspected petfood will be helpful. - Mod.AS]

Natasha Sawicki read about it on a vegetarian Web site. Jackie Miller
heard the news while on a cheese tour in Vermont.

What they discovered is probably the most overlooked, hidden animal
product in food otherwise considered vegetarian, says Boulder Co-op
Market cheese manager Chris Hill.

The mystery ingredient, still being discovered by many vegetarians ?
even in a veggie savvy place like Boulder ? is something called
rennet, also called rennin.

Rennin, according to the Barron's cooking guide, Food Lover's
Companion, is "a coagulating enzyme obtained from a young animal's
(usually a calf's) stomach." It's used to curdle milk in foods such
as cheese.

The knowledge made Sawicki, a vegetarian of five years, think twice
about so-called vegetarian foods. 
...
Discovering hidden animal products in food considered to be meat-free
is part of the lifelong, often complex journey of making conscious
food choices, vegetarians say.

It's not enough to stop eating hamburger, often followed by poultry
and fish. Those who embark on this path, largely motivated by ethics,
soon awaken to the fact that animal products and byproducts are found
in foods as seemingly innocent as chewing gum. (Some brands contain
stearic acid, an animal fat, or lanolin, the waxy fat from sheep's
wool.)

"The two biggest things people overlook are supplements with gel caps
and cheese with rennet," says Hill at the Co-op. "It's a real shock
to people."

The Boulder Co-op, an organic vegetarian market, stocks products from
at least 25 companies that offer either rennetless cheese, or cheese
made with vegetarian or microbial rennet. The refrigerated aisle is
flush with colorful cheese, including blocks of sharp cheddar,
triangles of Parmesan, tubs of fresh mozzarella, and packages of
sliced pepper jack. Haystack, a local maker of goat cheese, doesn't
use animal-based rennet, Hill says.

The wannabe Heydukes of the E.L.F most recently claimed responsibility for
$50 million in damage to a California real state development. Apparently
some people in California were trying to replace massive tracts of
untrammeled open space with pavement, heavily-fertilized lawns and
hundreds of rows of nearly identical particle-board houses. Paving
paradise and putting up a parking lot pisses off the people at E.L.F., so
they torched it.

Unfortunately, their extreme methods torched support for their cause, too.

If you?re not aware, these are the same people who claimed responsibility
for several fires on Vail Mountain that caused an estimated $12 million in
damage in October of 1998. Beyond property damage there were losses on a
different level: several priceless photographs of Vail in its early days
were destroyed, and all of the people who lived, worked, skied and
otherwise loved Vail Mountain were devastated and hurt to discover that a
place we considered ours would be attacked and tagged as anti-environmental.

But just like Heyduke and the Gang, the short-sighted people from E.L.F.
are not terrorists.

In an effort to condemn the E.L.F., good ol? U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis,
R-Grand Junction, is trying to elevate E.L.F.?s attacks to the level of
terrorism.

Oh, boy. Here we go again. 
...
There is a major difference between the terrible extremists in Al-Qaeda
and the eco-nerds in E.L.F., and that difference is human life. If human
beings were killed at Two Elk, human beings would now be afraid to enter
Two Elk. We would, as they say, be terrified for our lives.

On a more fundamental level, it is shallow and materialistic to equate the
destruction of property with the destruction of human life. But when it
comes down to it, that?s exactly what McInnis is trying to do.

With more than 60 percent of adults weighing in as overweight or obese,
public policymakers and government health officials are scrambling for
ways to improve the American diet.
...
Dr. Don Colbert, physician and nutritionist, thinks the obesity crisis
could be solved if Americans would pause before inhaling a super-sized
fast-food meal and ask themselves a simple question: "Would Jesus eat this?"

If it's loaded with saturated fats, sugar or artificial ingredients, the
answer is no, says Colbert, whose recent book, What Would Jesus Eat?
(Thomas Nelson, $22.99), combines biblical scholarship with conventional
dietary wisdom.
...
Colbert's not the only Christian diet guru urging people to ask what Jesus
would eat. Christian advocates of vegetarianism say if Jesus were alive
today, he would maintain a plant-based diet out of compassion for animals.
Others say Jesus would probably approve of genetically modified food,
given his own propensity for transforming and multiplying food in Scripture.
...
Although there may be disagreement over what Jesus would choose given the
option of a veggie burger, broiled lamb with garbanzo beans, or
genetically modified corn-on-the-cob, growing numbers of Christians are
looking to the Bible for dietary guidance, hoping that Scripture might
succeed where science has failed in inspiring healthy eating habits.

Dr. Stephen Kaufman, co-chair of the Christian Vegetarian Association,
said he hopes more Christians will start making faith-based choices about
what they eat.

"There are a lot of people out there for whom diet is a reflection of
their faith," he said. "We're taught to take care of our bodies, the
temple of God's spirit, as Paul said."
...
Calling the Christian vegetarian movement an "attempt to co-opt Jesus for
left-wing animal-rights propaganda," Moore cited Paul's letter to the
Romans, which calls vegetarians weak, as proof that the Bible sanctions
meat eating.

Though much of big science has centered on breakthroughs in
biotechnology, nanotechnology and more esoteric questions like the
age of our universe, a quieter story has been unfolding behind the
scenes in laboratories around the world ? one whose effect on human
perception and our understanding of life is likely to be profound.

What these researchers are finding is that many of our fellow
creatures are more like us than we had ever imagined. They feel pain,
suffer and experience stress, affection, excitement and even love ?
and these findings are changing how we view animals. 

 Strangely enough, some of the research sponsors are fast food
purveyors, such as McDonald's, Burger King and KFC. Pressured by
animal rights activists and by growing public support for the humane
treatment of animals, these companies have financed research into,
among other things, the emotional, mental and behavioral states of
our fellow creatures.

Studies on pigs' social behavior funded by McDonald's at Purdue
University, for example, have found that they crave affection and are
easily depressed if isolated or denied playtime with each other. The
lack of mental and physical stimuli can result in deterioration of
health. 
... 
So what does all of this portend for the way we treat our fellow
creatures? And for the thousands of animals subjected each year to
painful laboratory experiments? Or the millions of domestic animals
raised under the most inhumane conditions and destined for slaughter
and human consumption? Should we discourage the sale and purchase of
fur coats? What about fox hunting in the English countryside, bull
fighting in Spain? Should wild lions be caged in zoos?

Such questions are being raised. Harvard and 25 other U.S. law
schools have introduced law courses on animal rights, and an
increasing number of animal rights lawsuits are being filed. Germany
recently became the first nation to guarantee animal rights in its
constitution. </docText>

An American flag draped the small white coffin. Police officers stood stiffly 
in a solemn tribute under towering pines. Flower arrangements adorned the 
open grave -- some with bone-shaped dog biscuits attached. Faro, a Norfolk police 
dog shot to death while apprehending a robbery suspect last weekend, was laid 
to rest Friday in a pet cemetery in Virginia Beach. His send-off drew 
attention to the region's working police canines, trained to waylay suspects, protect 
police officers, search for people and, in some cases, sniff out contraband 
or bombs. It also highlighted the strong bonds between police and the dogs they 
handle, which officers take home to their families after shifts on the 
streets. Early last Saturday, Faro was killed doing his job. Police gave this 
account of the incident: The 4-year-old German shepherd was one of two police dogs 
who responded with officers to an armed-robbery call in the 9300 block of 1st 
View St. around 4:30 a.m. Robbers had forced a man to the ground at gunpoint. 
At least two suspects fled as police approached. Faro stopped a man, Patrick 
Marcel Davis, 25, as he attempted to get into a vehicle. Davis pulled a gun from 
a pocket and shot the dog. Faro's handler, Officer Jerry L. Nowell Jr., 
ordered Davis to drop his weapon, but he did not. Nowell fired, striking Davis in 
the foot. Another police canine ``engaged'' the man, who fell to the ground and 
tossed his gun to the curb. Officers arrested Davis, who faces charges of 
killing a police service animal, robbery, abduction and weapons counts.

Nowell Jr. 
Faro's funeral service began at the police K-9 Training Range near Norfolk 
International Airport. More than 30 police dogs, some from agencies around the 
state, sat in three rows with their handlers. Police from as far away as 
Roanoke attended, as did civilians. Top police officials praised Faro and his 
comrades. Norfolk's canines work for mere love and praise and, in return, give their 
all, said Lt. Wally Driskell. ``These dogs stand for everything that is good 
and loyal,'' he said. Acting Chief Shelton L. Darden lauded Faro as a hero. A 
bagpiper played ``Amazing Grace,'' and more than a few in the audience 
sniffled. A police motorcycle escort led the mourners in a procession to Garden of 
the Pines pet cemetery in Virginia Beach for graveside honors. Faro was buried 
next to Lobo, a police dog killed in the line of duty by a car in 1983, and 
Iron, shot while pursuing a suspect in 1997.

memorial service Friday. Photo by Hyunsoo Leo Kim / The Virginian-Pilot. 
An honor guard fired ceremonial rounds near the grave. More prayers were 
offered. Nowell accepted the flag from the coffin from members of an honor guard. 
Two buglers played taps. Officers shook Nowell's hand afterward. Faro's death 
was tough on his handler, other officers said. ``He said the hard part is when 
he goes home and sees the empty kennel in the backyard,'' Driskell said. 
``That's when it occurs to him that Faro's not coming home.''

The latest front in a global campaign being waged by radical animal
rights activists is a small Sonoma bistro where the spray-painted
word "torture" was being erased last week, replaced with the painted
image of an olive branch.

The peace symbol was a planned motif for Sonoma Saveurs even before
activists broke in and vandalized the restaurant two weeks ago,
stalling its opening. But the painting also could be seen as an act
of defiance.

Sides are being taken in the most unlikely of settings over foie
gras, a duck-liver delicacy that the restaurant's owners vow to serve
when they repair the damage and open, despite counter-promises from
activists to never let that happen.

Over the restaurant's front door where vandals spray-painted the word
"Stop," the owners hung a sign boldly declaring "Coming Soon!" and
the image of a duck.

"We don't want to create a big fight with these people," said
co-owner Didier Jaubert, whose home in Santa Rosa also was
vandalized. "We just tell them we respect what you want to eat, just
respect what we want to serve."
...
Victims' names on Internet

Activists who consider the process barbaric targeted Jaubert and
Manrique at home before focusing on their restaurant. In one
instance, vandals left behind a surreptitious videotape of Manrique's
family at his Mill Valley home.

The names, addresses and phone numbers of the victims also were
posted on the Internet.

Targeting people at home is a tactic more commonly used by animal
rights groups in Europe and on the East Coast but is now being used
here, Smiley said.

The cars and homes of some employees of Chiron Corp., a
pharmaceutical company, were targeted before two bombs went off
Thursday outside its Emeryville offices.

A radical animal rights group claimed responsibility for that attack,
and Smiley said it was the first time that he could recall where an
actual explosive device was used.

"It's a trend that is beginning to be frightening," Smiley said.

Journalist Martin Coutts gives the details of a lengthy undercover
investigation conducted into a Premier Foods chicken farm, one of the
UK's largest chicken producers and known KFC supplier. The
investigators, working in conjunction with an undercover team from
Hillside Animal Sanctuary, shot extensive video footage of the
conditions on this factory farm. Here are some descriptions of the
cruelty they uncovered: 
. "There are more than 36,000 chickens here in huge windowless sheds.
The conditions they have to endure during their short, brutal lives are
so horrific it defies belief." 
. "Some birds are so lame and deformed they can only drag themselves to
the food and water troughs by their wings. Others stand motionless, too
dazed or dying to move." 
. "In one shed where chickens had been taken away for slaughter there
were dozens of carcasses littering the floor. In another - where scores
of birds had died - their remains were being picked over by other
chickens." 
. "One investigator who shot a secret film there said: 'I have
investigated animal welfare for many years, but this easily ranks
amongst some of the worst cruelty I have seen.'" 
KFC claims to have animal welfare standards in place which cover "all
chicken[s] intended to be sold at KFC," but such words are meaningless
when they allow hideous abuses to take place. And Premier Foods won the
"KFC Supplier of the Year Award" in January of 2001. If this level of
abuse represents the best of what KFC suppliers have to offer, imagine
what other farms allow! 

PETA is calling on KFC to immediately adopt PETA's recommended animal
welfare guidelines internationally. PETA's guidelines have been approved
by members of KFC's own animal welfare advisory panel and represent the
most up-to-date studies and research into animal welfare. Click here

Local farmers mixed on milk plan


A controversial farmer-initiated program designed to cut milk production 
nationwide and raise the milk price paid to farmers has drawn mixed reviews 
from Clark County dairy owners.

    Some local farmers and milk processors worry the supply reduction, set 
to begin this fall, could also drive milk prices up at the grocery store and 
alienate consumers. Others are skeptical whether the plan, conceived by the 
60,000-member National Milk Producers Federation, will work.

    "It's sorta idiotic, isn't it?" said Ron Andersen, the county's biggest 
dairyman, who runs about 1,200 cows and operates milk-processing and 
plastics plants and a truck line in Battle Ground. "My history has made me 
negative to all this. I don't want anything to do with it. I work on the 
open market on the law of supply and demand."

    Any worry about retail milk prices rising seems to be misplaced. At 
Vancouver stores, milk sells for $2 to $5 a gallon, depending on packaging 
and brand. Store owners often price milk as a "loss leader," selling it for 
little or no profit because it brings customers into the store where they 
buy other products.

Dolphins had been called upon to clear the waterways leading into Iraq,
around the port of Umm Qasr. They had been trained by the U.S. Navy to use
their natural sonar abilities to detect mines that had been planted in an
attempt to destroy British and American warships. By attaching a weighted
buoy line to the mine, divers could then safely neutralize the weapons.

The Navy will not comment on successes or failures, but it was
well-documented in April that the British ship RFA Sir Galahad had been
able to deliver vital shipments of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people
following clearance of the waterways around the port.
...
The Navy denies that any harm is done to the trained dolphins. McCormick
explained that some of the dolphins he has trained had lived to 35 years
of age ? longer than the life expectancy in the wild.

?In 40 years of working with dolphins, I have never heard of a dolphin
being killed on the job,? he said.

?They receive a choice diet ? 20 pounds of fish per day ? regular medical
checks, their own sleeping quarters, and they work untethered in the open
sea.?

Dawn Carr, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
argues that the animals? ?sleeping quarters? are 6-foot by 6-foot cages.
Carr also says the dolphins were trained through force and food
deprivation, and were fed dead fish that had lost vital nutrients that
wild dolphins receive from live fish. The Navy denies the dolphins live in
6-by-6 cages, and said that the animals operate in a more natural sea
water environment where they could interact with other marine life.

PETA believes that dolphins can stray or not be able to defend themselves
in foreign waters.

  SCIENTISTS HIGHLIGHT FISH 'INTELLIGENCE'

  Fish are socially intelligent creatures who do not deserve their
reputation
  as the dim-wits of the animal kingdom, according to a group of leading
  scientists.
 
  Scientists say fish do not deserve their "dim-witted" reputation
  Rather than simply being instinct-driven, the group says fish are 
cunning,
  manipulative and even cultured.
 
  The three experts from the universities of Edinburgh, St Andrews and 
Leeds
  said there had been huge changes in science's understanding of the
  psychological and mental abilities of fish in the last few years.
 
  Writing in the journal Fish and Fisheries, biologists Calum Brown, Keven
  Laland and Jens Krause said fish were now seen as highly intelligent
  creatures.
 
  They said: "Gone (or at least obsolete) is the image of fish as drudging
and
  dim-witted pea-brains, driven largely by 'instinct',' with what little
  behavioural flexibility they possess being severely hampered by an
infamous
  'three-second memory'.

  "Now, fish are regarded as steeped in social intelligence, pursuing
  Machiavellian strategies of manipulation, punishment and reconciliation,
  exhibiting stable cultural traditions, and co-operating to inspect
predators
  and catch food."

After receiving complaints about aggressive and barking 
dogs, members of the Jefferson County Commission have decided to study the 
types of laws they can pass to control the problem. 
One county resident complained about barking dogs at last Thursday night's 
commission meeting and Commissioner Greg Corliss said he has received several 
phone calls from residents complaining about aggressive dogs. 
Corliss said he would like to see the county pass a law dealing with barking, 
vicious and unleashed dogs. 


The commissioners are reviewing dog-control laws that have been passed 
recently in Berkeley County, Corliss said. 
On Aug. 28, the Berkeley County Commission put the final touches on a barking 
dog ordinance that carries a $100 fine for a first-time offense. 
Subsequent offenses carry up to a $250 fine under the law, which will take 
effect Oct. 1.

Beginning September 8, activists will maintain a daily lunch
hour presence outside the Massachusetts Teachers Association's (MTA)
headquarters at 20 Ashburton Place in Boston.
Organized by the Ethical Science and Education Coalition (ESEC), this
protest will draw attention to the MTA's opposition to Massachusetts House
Bill 1252, An Act Relative to Dissection Choice.
Introduced by Representative Louis Kafka (D-Sharon), H.1252 will protect
students from academic penalty if their religious or ethical beliefs require
alternatives to animal dissection.
From September 8 until the day of the bill?s hearing at the State House,
activists will inform the public about MTA?s continuing opposition to
granting students the legally protected right to choose humane alternatives
to traditional specimen dissection.
The MTA's interference in lobbying against H.1252 has kept passage of this
bill at bay for years, despite compelling evidence that many MA teachers
support such legislation. Says ESEC president Dr. Theo Capaldo, "A recent
Tufts University (2001) study shows that a nearly two-thirds or 64% of
Massachusetts life science teachers support a dissection choice bill."

Monroe is apparently a popular home for man and beast alike - including 
coyotes. 
The Monroe Animal Control Unit reported 107 coyote sighting between June 2002 
and July 2003 - a 149 percent increase from last year.
"Normally we get a lot of reports in the spring, from March to June. This 
year it has been nonstop," said Animal Control Officer Edward Risko.
Increased reporting spiked at 74 coyote sightings in just the last two 
months. Risko said the increased sightings are part of a natural trend across the 
state. 
Normal methods like trapping and hunting in designated areas are no longer 
working because the adaptable coyote has apparently learned to avoid hunting 
areas, he said.
"Virtually nothing can be done to control the [coyote population], just like 
the deer," he said.
An increase in residential population could also play a role in coyote 
sightings.
The Animal Control Unit has been tracking the animals with every report, but 
Risko said it's difficult to mark a fixed point where the coyotes are because 
they naturally roam, stopping only to den up in late spring.
Due to environmental laws, the unit is not allowed to kill coyotes unless 
they appear to be a threat.
"What we're concerned with is the abnormal, like a sick or injured coyote," 
he said.
Though coyotes are relatively nonthreatening animals, the unit has received 
eight reports of attacks on domestic dogs, with three dogs killed and five 
injured.
For each sighting Risko said he gives residents a packet of information on 
coyotes and ways to keep them off their property.
"People have to realize that coyotes are here," Risko said, "and precautions 
need to be made."

Even though Eagle County appears to be mostly free of chronic wasting
disease, a series of recently released scientific reports and reviews
shows there is still plenty of concern about the fatal brain malady.

Some research shows that CWD may spread inexorably across the state -&#x2013;
including Eagle County &#x2013; unless wildlife managers take aggressive
management action, including potentially controversial steps like culling
infected animals and thinning at-risk herds.

An independent panel of university researchers and wildlife experts from
around the country reviewed Colorado&#x2019;s CWD management strategy and issued
a Blue Ribbon report, praising the state&#x2019;s "diligence and leadership in
investigating the disease and for educating the public &#x2026; CDOW efforts
serve as a model for other wildlife agencies," the report concludes. 
...
Population density may also be factor: "High animal density and frequency
of contact are associated with increased incidence of infection &#x2026; no data
available linking density to transmission rate in the wild, but extremely
high prevalence has been observed under captive conditions, suggesting
that transmission may be density dependent, the panel states.

These finding emphasize the need for continued monitoring, testing and
adaptive management. And that includes targeted culling, which means
killing deer and elk in areas where clusters of CWD are found. In past
years, culling has been somewhat controversial politically, generating
some resistance both from animal rights activists and from residents
concerned about disposal issues associated with infected carcasses.

Treated unfairly, monkeys go on strike
Unequal rewards immediately noticed, researcher finds


Peace-loving capuchin monkeys may not carry picket signs like workers in a 
labor dispute, but the little animals do balk at unequal pay -- and they'll 
even go on strike if they see they're being treated unfairly -- researchers 
have found.

A piece of humdrum cucumber, according to researchers, just doesn't do it 
for a hard-working female capuchin -- especially if she sees her partner 
being rewarded with a tasty grape for performing little or no work. The 
monkey will simply do the primate equivalent of putting down her tools -- 
rejecting the measly cucumber and stopping work -- until she gets equal pay.

"Wouldn't you resent it, too, if you found that your colleagues at The San 
Francisco Chronicle were getting more bylines than you, even though they're 
doing a lot less work to get the credit?" asked Sarah Brosnan, a graduate 
researcher at the famed Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta. 
"Well, our monkeys feel that way, too, and they act on it to make sure 
they're treated right," she said.

The findings, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, shed 
light on the evolutionary advantages of cooperation among animals in the 
wild, said Brosnan, because they suggest that such behavior can make a group 
of monkeys more closely knit and better able to avoid predators.

Brosnan and Frans de Waal, director of the Yerkes center's "Living Links" 
laboratory at Emory University, have completed the first experimental 
demonstration of fairness and unfairness in nonhuman primates, and they 
believe they have found excellent analogies to human behavior.

When I moved to Oregon from England in 1976, "hunting" was just one of
many American words I failed to understand. Where I came from, hunting was
something you did on horseback with hounds. It was usually about killing
foxes, though sometimes in Scotland it involved deer. If you wanted to
carry a gun, you used your own two feet and went after pheasants and
partridges (the upper classes) or rabbits, hares and lowlier birds
(everybody else). This was called "shooting," never "hunting."
...
Objections to banning hunts tend to center on the expendable, too numerous
or even dangerous (to humans) nature of the animals concerned. Sometimes
tradition is invoked and always human superiority is assumed. But
underneath these objections, I believe, lies a more profound fear of what
might happen to us if we gave up our ritual engagements with death.

Whether we recognize it or not, exercising our power to kill other living
creatures keeps at bay the certain knowledge of our own frailty: our
vulnerability to cancer, old age, terrorism. I wonder who we might become
if we had to face this knowledge and live our lives in its shadow. I tend
to think we might be wiser and, perhaps, happier.

One day our descendents will look back on these ritual "sports" with the
same degree of disgust as we look back at the slave-gladiators killing
each other for the amusement of the Romans or the man who placed his own
daughter's head on the block. As for the foxes and deer, elk and bulls,
the random crows hanging from trees and the rabbits caught in traps -- all
those who entertain us by getting stalked and chased, wounded, shot or
torn apart -- they will surely be better off when we find something better
to do. Judith Barrington is a poet, memoirist and creative writing teacher
who lives in Portland. Her third collection of poems, "Horses and the
Human Soul," will appear next spring.

For Immediate Release

FUND FOR ANIMALS ASKS JUNIOR COLLEGE TO CANCEL HUNTING COURSE

In a letter dated September 12 to 
Dr. Tom Delaino, president of Pensacola Junior College, The Fund for 
Animals, a national animal protection group with 200,000 members and 
active supporters, has asked the school to cancel a non-credit course in 
White-tailed Deer Stalk Hunting for Beginners. In the letter, program 
coordinator Norm Phelps said that the college Would never even consider 
offering a course in how to stalk and shoot dogs and cats because you 
would not want PJC to promote the cruel treatment of animals. The same 
reasoning should apply to a course in stalking and shooting deer. 
Phelps called hunting legalized cruelty to animals.

Noting that the catalog describes the course as geared to students 
8-80, Phelps said that, It is irresponsible to encourage children to 
go into the woods carrying high-powered, long-range firearms. They are 
too young to possess the mature judgement needed to use them safely, and 
many are not strong enough to consistently fire them accurately.
After pointing out that all of the virtues claimed for hunting, such as 
self-reliance, self-esteem, and an appreciation of nature, derive from 
the pursuit, not the kill, Phelps said, I am happy to see that you 
offer a course in Nature Photography (R00309). This course will teach 
all of the skills and provide all of the satisfactions of a hunting 
course without teaching children and young people to kill innocent 
animals. I urge you cancel the course in deer hunting and send your 
students into the woods armed only with cameras.

Michael Markarian, president of The Fund for Animals said that, When 
you strip away the mythology, sport hunting is killing animals for 
pleasure. Community colleges should not be promoting this kind of animal 
abuse to anyone, least of all children.

Veterinary Ventures, Inc. has introduced its award winning Drinkwell Pet 
Fountain to the UK. The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is the original and only pet 
fountain with a patented free falling stream, that is most like the running water 
pets crave. The fountain was designed and patented by a licensed veterinarian, 
Dr. Mary Burns, to satisfy a pet's urge for running water. 

The fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it fresher 
than standing bowl water. The product helps maintain proper hydration in 
pets, an essential ingredient for keeping pets healthy. New to the UK, the 
Drinkwell Pet Fountain is set to be the latest luxury for pampered pets - and it has 
a serious side too.. 

Research shows that one of the best ways to improve a pet's health is to 
encourage the pet to drink more water. By using a 5-inch falling stream to break 
the surface tension of the water, the Drinkwell Pet Fountain continually 
aerates a pet's water with healthful oxygen. Aerated water tastes fresher and you 
can even see it working as tiny bubbles appear in the water. A charcoal filter 
removes bad tastes and odours giving the pet the best possible and most 
appealing way to stay hydrated! It satisfies the urge for running water and helps 
eliminate jumping on counters in search of dripping taps. 

The product helps prevent urinary tract disease in cats by maintaining proper 
hydration. As the veterinarian who created the Drinkwell Pet Fountain knows, 
many cats do not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason the 
urine can become concentrated predisposing some cats to urinary tract disease. 
Cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for water to 
support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction.

Grazing: A property right?
Ranchers believe so, but the federal BLM says it&#x2019;s just a lease

Rancher Bob Miller is bracing himself for the likely end of open range 
grazing on the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

"There has been so much adverse publicity and so many people who don&#x2019;t 
understand the situation that we will not be able to survive this battle, 
physically or economically," he concludes.

"Consequently, if the public wants the cattle off that bad, then they should 
pay us for the property rights we own," he says of grazing permits. "These 
are valid existing property rights."

Rancher Don Rowlett agrees.
"If running cattle out here becomes such an issue that we have to spend half 
our lives trying to defend it, trying to meet the rules and regulations and 
facing the lawsuits that come from it, well, I don&#x2019;t have that much time 
left to live," he says.

But ranchers have to be able to replace lost grazing lands if they are to 
survive, he says.

"The biggest issue to all of us is the replacement," he says. "It has to be 
at a fair market value."

Uncle Sam doesn&#x2019;t quite see it that way, says Rich Drehobl, manager of the 
Bureau of Land Management&#x2019;s Ashland Resource Area.

He says the bureau does not recognize an AUM &#x2014; animal unit month, the 
equivalent of a cow and a calf feeding for one month &#x2014;as vested property 
rights."We only recognize it as a lease," he says. "It&#x2019;s a privilege, not a 
right. From the government&#x2019;s perspective, they (ranchers) have nothing to 
sell."

Metropoultry: Chickens in the city? Urban egg-layers are fun and legal

Larry and Blythe Knechtel's North Seattle home would look like any other 
Tudor on the block, except it's stucco, not brick. But that's not the big 
difference. Go around back and you'll see what truly sets the Knechtel 
homestead apart.

There, under a large sheltering rhododendron, pecking and putting a slender 
foot to work to send dirt flying, are the girls. Buffy the Insect Slayer and 
her two poultry pals. Dusty, so-named because she's a dusty gray, and Raven. 
Yes, she is indeed a beautiful shiny black, and highly entertaining, which 
is why Blythe talked Larry and their four kids into building a custom 
chicken coop beside the raised garden bed bulging with tomatoes.

"Where else can city kids see chickens and catch an egg when one comes out?" 
asks Blythe.

Nor, surprisingly, is there any shortage of families like the Knechtels, 
decidedly urban folk whose hobby is backyard chicken farming. The birds can 
be found &#x2014; and sometimes heard &#x2014; in yards throughout Wallingford, Phinney 
Ridge, Magnolia, Capitol Hill, West Seattle, Rainier Valley and elsewhere.

  For the first time, the British Columbia
Automobile Association's (BCAA) Insurance Agency will be offering a product
exclusively designed to provide security and peace of mind for its members'
four-legged friends. The new CAA-branded pet health insurance, aimed at
providing pet owners with easier access to insurance, is being piloted
exclusively in B.C. before being rolled out by other CAA-affiliated auto
clubs.
    According to a research study conducted by Pet Plan Insurance - BCAA's
pet insurance provider - one in three pets will experience a new illness or
injury requiring veterinary care this year, with one in six pets sustaining
two or more illnesses or injuries.
    "When a pet is injured or gets sick, the resulting vet bills can result
in a huge financial burden which sometimes isn't manageable," says Suzanne
Milino, BCAA Manager of Insurance Product Development. "With this insurance,
pet-loving BCAA members will be able to increase their peace of mind at a
level that suits their budget."
    Three different levels of coverage are available under this plan:
Compact, an accident-only plan; Intermediate, an accident and illness plan
that offers $2,500 of coverage per year; and Luxury, a second accident and
illness plan that offers $4,500 of coverage per year.
    "Pet health insurance helps to promote the highest quality care and
reduces instances of economic euthanasia, which is a heartbreaking decision
for any pet owner," said Dr. Ian Sandler, Rosedale Animal Hospital in Toronto,
Ontario. "We have seen that for many pet owners, this type of insurance allows
us to provide a higher level of care for their pets than they might have
afforded on their own."

Got Raw Milk?
Not Unless You
Own Your Own Cow
Robert Corya, a retiree in Indianapolis, craves a substance that Indiana law forbids him to buy: unpasteurized milk. He and his wife drink eight gallons of it a month, and he believes it makes him healthier. "Tastes like melted French vanilla ice cream," he says.

Mr. Corya can slake his thirst thanks to a dairy cow named Charlotte and a loophole that is setting off battles over milk across the U.S. Laws in Indiana and other states allow cow owners to drink raw milk from their own cows. So Mr. Corya bought a share in Charlotte.

 
Today, there are more than a dozen cow-share programs in the U.S. Farmers Mark and Deborah Apple of McCordsville, Ind., who launched a program for Charlotte and their other cows early last year, say demand is so great that people sometimes burst into tears when told they have to go on a waiting list.</docText>

      Last of the lions 
     
        
      If people can't learn how to live with lions, we might well have to live without them. Stephanie Pain tells the sorry tale of a disappearing predator 
     
        
      "I'M SORRY, could you repeat that figure please?" The phone line was crackly and I thought I must have misheard. Laurence Frank said it again. "Around 23,000." That, it seems, is how many lions remain in the whole of Africa. It's a shockingly small number. But there is worse: "It's not just lions. Populations of all African predators are plummeting," says Frank, a wildlife biologist at the University of California, Berkeley.

      Twenty years ago the lion population seemed in good shape. There were no hard figures but conservationists guessed there were around 200,000. Inside parks and reserves they seemed to be thriving. What no one had noticed was that they were disappearing everywhere else, and so were other predators. Wild dogs once roamed over most of sub-Saharan Africa. Now there are between 3000 and 5500, living in a tiny fraction of their former territory. Cheetahs once ranged over most of Africa and central and western Asia: today there are fewer than 15,000. What shocks Frank most is that no one seems to realise how close to disaster these animals are. "People know about elephants, gorillas and rhinos, but they seem blissfully unaware that these large carnivores are nearing the brink."

      What has happened to send these populations of predators into free fall? The short answer is people. People with guns, spears, poison and snares. "People have always killed predators," says Frank. "But there's only so much damage you can do with spears and shields. Now everyone has got rifles and poisons." The slaughter began when Europeans arrived, and a century later, Africa's predators are in real trouble. They aren't yet in such desperate straits as those in other parts of the world, however. "Almost everywhere else, big carnivores have had it already," says Frank. "In Africa it's not too late to save the situation."

The African wild dog is one of the world's rarest carnivores, extinct in most of its former range. Despite recent efforts to conserve it, most of the deaths, even inside parks, are still caused by people, says Rosie Woodroffe, an expert on the species. The dogs now number somewhere between 3000 and 5500 and are declining almost everywhere.

The one bright spot is Laikipia in Kenya, where Woodroffe heads the Samburu-Laikipia Wild Dog Project. Wild dogs were eradicated in the district 20 years ago. In December 1998, Woodroffe heard reports of wild dogs moving in from Samburu to the north-east. By 2000, some dogs had settled in Laikipia and made dens. Now there are at least eight packs and more than 100 dogs. "This is amazing. In 1997 there were only six populations of this size known in the whole of Africa, mostly in southern Africa," she says. "These northern dogs are genetically distinct, which makes them a very important population."

Wild dogs are a big draw to tourists. At Laikipia they have mostly colonised communal land where the other top attraction, the lion, has been wiped out. The local Masai people recognise the wild dog's potential to lure tourists away from commercial ranches and spend some time at community-owned lodges. Even so, not everyone is pleased to see wild dogs return. Although they rarely attack cattle or animals kept in bomas they will go for sheep or goats left unattended or guarded by children, and individual herders can suffer big losses, says Woodroffe. "Several dogs have been shot, one speared, one I'm not sure about - and four killed on the road," she says.

At the moment, the best way to protect the wild dogs is by an early-warning system. Many of the dogs wear radio collars and are tracked by aircraft, so Woodroffe and her team know exactly where the packs are. If there's a risk of an attack on livestock, the team radioes the local community liaison officer, who jumps on his motorbike and sets off to warn those in the dogs' path.

Guam to benefit from coral reef summit

The ancient and beautiful rock-like animals that live under the transparent
sapphire waters surrounding Guam will be getting a lot of attention in a few
weeks. 
Those animals are the ones that protect the island during typhoons, that
house the fish we later turn into kelaguen and sashimi, and that many
believe are the island's No. 1 ticket out of its economic blues. 
Attention, as well as money and other kinds of support, is what Guam's coral
experts and managers are hoping the island's reefs get out of next month's
Coral Reef Task Force meeting, which will be held in the Mariana islands for
the first time, according to the Task Force's Web site. 
In a rare moment for Guam, dozens of officials from as many federal agencies
will all be on island at the same time. Representatives from entities
including the Department of the Interior, Department of Transportation,
Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of Defense and
even NASA will arrive on island to make sure they are on the same page in
halting what they call the global "coral reef crisis." 
According to Gerry Davis, the Department of Agriculture's Division of
Aquatic and Wildlife Resources chief and one of the main organizers of the
meeting, the meeting's purpose is to bring all entities that have a stake in
the future of the planet's reefs to one place. Officials from each entity
will present a report on their progress and an action plan for the future,
as well as ask for the financial and logistical support they need to protect
the nation's reefs. 
The coral isn't the only thing to benefit from the Task Force meeting,
according to Davis. With dozens of dignitaries on island, he said, it will
afford the governor and others the opportunity to ask for other help, such
as funding to help clean up the sewage outfalls in Hag?t?a Bay, money to
close the Ordot dump or cooperation in resolving Guam's conflict with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over the Critical Habitat designation.

Molecule Found in Meat, Milk and Tumors - Study
A non-human molecule found in red meat and milk makes 
its way into the human system when eaten -- and seems to build up especially 
in tumors, U.S. researchers reported on Monday.



The compound, called sialic acid, is found on the surfaces of animal cells 
but is not found in people, and may be one reason why animal-to-human organ 
and tissue transplants do not work well. Animals have a version called 
Neu5Gc, while humans carry Neu5Ac.


But researchers at the University of California San Diego found it does show 
up in the human body, and showed it can be absorbed from eating red meat and 
milk.


They also showed that the body produces an immune response against the 
molecule.


Dr. Ajit Varki and colleagues, reporting in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences (news - web sites), say it is too soon to make any 
recommendations based on their findings.</docText>

Sightings of big cats on rise in city's parks, greenbelt

It seems unlikely, but an increasing number of mountain lions have 
been spotted along Boise's famous greenbelt and in urban parks during the 
past few months.

On Monday, Gary Mountain was riding his bicycle on a path near the Boise 
River at lunchtime when he spotted a cougar crossing the greenbelt below 
Warm Springs Mesa.

"I thought, `Do I look like a predator to him or do I look like lunch?"' 
Mountain said after the incident.

Idaho Fish and Game officials say mountain lions are more common this year 
in the foothills above Boise because deer numbers have increased.

Mild winters in the past few years have increased deer numbers; and mountain 
lions follow the herds. In all, there have been about a dozen reports in the 
past several months in the Boise area.</docText>

In the mid-1980s, a vaccine was developed to prevent feline leukemia
virus, an infection deadly to cats. I was employed in a small-animal
veterinary practice, where too often I had seen the virus claim the lives
of my patients.

The new vaccine inspired a change in my career direction. I wanted to
learn about and participate in efforts to create and test the treatments
we rely on for the health of our pets and ourselves. Today, I am a
laboratory animal veterinarian: a part of the profession dedicated to
humane, proper and safe care and use of laboratory animals.

I work with caring people whose daily actions reflect compassion for
animals. These are not individuals who show their concern for animals by
carrying placards in public demonstrations. Nor do they engage in acts of
terrorism in the name of animal liberation. Rather, they come to work each
day and go about the important business of caring for laboratory animals.

Who really cares about laboratory animals? If actions speak louder than
words, it's not the animal-rights advocates. The compassionate people are
the ones inside the biomedical research facilities. 
...
In contrast, consider how the actions of animal-rights activists affect
the well-being of animals such as 151L. Outside research facilities and
scientific meetings, activists carry signs and chant slogans. Or worse,
they scream obscenities, spit on, and attempt to provoke and intimidate
people entering and leaving the buildings. Some groups, such as the Animal
Liberation Front (ALF), proudly claim credit for acts of arson, bombings
and sabotage at research facilities ? violence that is dangerous to
research animals as well as humans.

Groups such as Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) engage in acts of
intimidation and threats. In Seattle, smoke bombs were set off during
business hours in two downtown high-rises, ostensibly because insurance
offices there did business with research labs. Locally based animal-rights
groups regularly picket the homes of researchers in the Seattle area.
Slurs and graffiti have been painted on scientists' cars and property.
Across the U.S. and here in Washington state, research facilities have
been broken into and vandalized, and animals have been stolen ? in some
cases "liberated" to die, hit by cars or killed by predators.

  West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne illness that 
has killed almost 100 Americans this year, has just a toehold in California 
-- it is lurking here, in the dried-out desert marshes at the edge of the 
Salton Sea.

Soon, that may change for the worse.

Over the objections of local mosquito control experts, hundreds of acres 
owned by private duck clubs are being flooded, with water pumped from wells, 
to accommodate bird life for the hunting season.

Predictably, the sparse mosquito population has begun to grow.

Pesticide spraying and other mosquito abatement techniques may keep the 
disease in check, but Riverside County scientists are concerned. The duck 
ponds are known for breeding large swarms of Culex tarsalis, the mosquito 
species that lab studies show is best suited for transmitting West Nile.

"We are going to see an increase in the number of mosquitoes we catch in 
traps," said Branka Lothrop, an ecologist for the Coachella Valley Mosquito 
and Vector Control District in Riverside County. "Instead of five or 10 per 
trap each night, there will be hundreds or even thousands."

Lothrop is concerned that the flooding of the desert marshes will create 
ideal conditions to boost the virus. "All those hunters are 65 to 70 years 
old,

and they get covered with mosquitoes," she said. "And building up the 
mosquito population in the fall cannot be good for the spring."

A Stratford farm opened its doors Saturday to friends, neighbors and a state 
official to demonstrate the inner workings of a modern dairy farm, as well 
as to discuss the future of Wisconsin agriculture. At Maple Ridge Dairy 
Inc., Rod Nilsestuen, secretary of the state Department of Agriculture, 
Trade and Consumer Protection, spoke about bolstering Wisconsin's 
agricultural sector through a cooperation of governments, businesses and 
individual farmers. "As we look as a state in attracting and building new 
industries, we must remember what has already made a great impact," 
Nilsestuen said. "We need to make agriculture, both for the farmer and the 
state, profitable and sustainable in the long term."

The state of agriculture has changed dramatically. In 1978, 43,500 dairy 
farmers worked throughout Wisconsin, but now that number is down to 16,500 
due to retirement and stress of the industry, he said. To give the 
agriculture sector a boost, the state must unify its siting regulations, an 
issue that has pitted farmers against citizens at large, especially 
environmentalists, Nilsestuen said. "Minnesota had what was almost like a 
civil war between agriculture and environmentalists," he said. "We can't 
afford years of duking it out on the issue." The cost could be staggering, 
with a $40 billion agriculture and food industry depending on $30 billion 
from dairy and livestock, he said.

Nilsestuen said he had formed a committee of county and town officials and 
environmental groups to discuss scientifically based environmental 
standards, making siting a more predictable and transparent process that can 
still have local control. "I don't think state preemption will come out of 
this," he said. "We have to have balance."

Many of the problems in agriculture can be traced to a population shift, 
said Patrick Geoghegan, vice president of Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board. 
"We're seeing more urbanites who have lost a connection with agriculture," 
he said. "If we are to remain America's Dairyland, we must evolve as an 
industry." The process can begin by working with neighbors and showing them 
how the industry works, such as through events like the open house, he said.

  Scientific Advisory Committee has
approved adding a new feed alternative for inducing a molt to the industry?s
Animal Care Guidelines. Following three independent university studies, egg
farmers now have the option of using a non-feed withdrawal to induce a molt,
rather than the traditional practice of withholding feed for a short period
of time [They've always had this option as well as the option to not force
molt the birds at all]. Molting flocks results in 50 percent fewer hens
needed to meet the nation?s demand for eggs, which means significantly fewer
hens are handled, transported and slaughtered than if molting was not
induced.

The UEP Scientific Advisory Committee, which established the Animal Care
Guidelines and includes several the nation?s top scientists and academics,
met this month and agreed upon the following statement: "The Scientific
Advisory Committee says that non-feed withdrawal molt research projects have
shown promise and at this time will recommend non-feed withdrawal programs
as another option for inducing a molt. These programs should be used only if
they meet or exceed the welfare standards previously established by the
committee for feed withdrawal molts, including the standards for preparing
the flock for the molt and for maximum molt mortality and hen weight loss."

According to Dr. Jeff Armstrong, dean of the College of Agriculture and
Natural Resources at Michigan State University and chair of the Scientific
Advisory Committee: "The research on this new feed alternative has been
conducted in three university settings, but the true test will come from
field studies in the commercial egg industry. We are urging egg producers to
give the non-feed withdrawal programs a try and report their conclusions
back to us, because this is a subject we are continuing to study."

Last weekend, an American soldier killed a
rare Bengal tiger in its cage in the Baghdad zoo.

The caged tiger&#x2019;s capital offense: biting a drunken G.I. when he
baited the animal by sticking his arm in its cage in an attempt to
feed it. The tiger reportedly tore off one of the G.I.&#x2019;s fingers
and mauled his arm, before another soldier shot it in the head
three times.

Fatal encounters with carousing Americans troops aside, by the
year 2150 zoos and test tubes will likely be the only places that
Bengal tigers and all other man-eating predators will survive,
according to natural history writer David Quammen in his new
book, &#x201c;Monster of God: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles
of History and the Mind.&#x201d;

Quammen eschews &#x201c;zoological melodrama&#x201d; or &#x201c;predator
pornography,&#x201d; as he dubs the pulpy genre that encompasses
most true-life tales of encounters between humans and the
carnivores that occasionally eat them. His book is less monster
bloodbath than an effort to understand how humans and their
sometime predators still (barely) coexist today, and what exactly
will be lost if the big cats, bears and crocodiles go extinct.
When you&#x2019;re in the Russian Far East, one native Udege man
tells you that he&#x2019;s personally killed four Siberian tigers. There
are only a few hundred of these tigers left in the world. You
write that hearing this was like a splash of &#x201c;cold water,&#x201d; but
that since you&#x2019;ve been traveling to investigate alpha-predator
populations that share land with humans, you&#x2019;ve learned that the
&#x201c;the world is full of cold water&#x201d; and you&#x2019;ve often found yourself
&#x201c;chilly and wet.&#x201d; What do you mean by that?

I started the book project partially because I was very interested
in what big predators meant to the people who live closest to
them, who live in the highest jeopardy.
Which humans have the most to fear from these alpha predators?

The people who suffer the most inconvenience, the most danger,
the most misery from big predators, the ones who pay the costs
of big predators, are generally the poor and the dispossessed of
land. They&#x2019;re native people who live very close to the landscape
with a very small margin of safety.

Are there any good examples of that kind of rearrangement?

Only a very few pilot projects or beginning programs that need
to be built.

One of them is in the Northern Territory of Australia, where
Aboriginal people are being allowed to begin harvesting crocodiles
again.

Those people live out there in crocodile habitat, and if anybody
is going to be killed by a saltwater crocodile, they&#x2019;re sort of the
first in the crosshairs. But now they&#x2019;re also being allowed to
harvest crocodile skin.

Ten people are thought to have died during the past three
years from the side effects of over-the-counter drugs, such
as cold medications and hair-loss remedies, a health
ministry report revealed Friday.
About 1,200 cases of people dying from side effects of
medicines prescribed by hospitals are reported annually.
But
this is the first time the ministry has disclosed the
number
of deaths linked to over-the-counter drugs.
The figures were compiled by pharmaceutical manufacturers
and submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
According to the report, three men died in 2000 after using
RiUP, a hair-loss remedy manufactured by Taisho
Pharmaceutical Co. The product contains minoxidil, which
can
stimulate hair growth when applied topically to the scalp.
A causal link between the three deaths and the product has
yet to be confirmed, according to the manufacturer's report
to the ministry.
Soon after RiUP hit shelves in 1999, complaints began
rolling in saying it caused heart palpitations and chest
pains. Following the reports, Taisho Pharmaceutical added a
label to the product's package in late 1999, warning people
suffering from angina or high blood pressure to take care
when using the product.
One woman, who was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver,
also died after taking Shosaikoto, a Chinese medicine said
to bolster liver functions. The woman died of interstitial
pneumonia, likely triggered by the drug.
The remaining six people died from anaphylactic shock-a fit
brought on by an allergic reaction-or severe skin disorders
after taking medication for colds or rhinitis-nasal
irritation and inflammation.
``Although the risk of developing side effects from
over-the-counter medicines is fairly low, there are a few
cases of grave side effects,'' a ministry official said.
``Please read the instructions (provided with the medicine)
carefully and stop using the product and consult a
physician
if you develop strange symptoms.''

A federal judge said Procter &amp; Gamble's
advertising for its over-the-counter heartburn drug strayed
too far from the truth with claims that it would provide 24
hours of relief.
Judge John E. Sprizzo said a week ago that he agreed with
the claims of a joint venture by Johnson &amp; Johnson and
Merck
&amp; Co., which said P&amp;G was cheating in its ads for Prilosec
OTC, an over-the-counter version of Prilosec, a heartburn
and ulcer drug. In a written ruling made public Friday,
Sprizzo explained why he granted a preliminary injunction
to
block the ads, which he concluded were "literally false."
He said one pill of Prilosec OTC, introduced nationwide
this
month, does not provide actual relief until up to four or
five hours after it is ingested, despite the company's
claims that it provides relief for a full 24 hours. Sprizzo
rejected P&amp;G arguments that the advertisement was true
because the relief lasts for 24 hours once it begins. "'One
pill. 24 Hours. Zero Heartburn,' simply does not equal 'One
pill. Wait five hours. Only then Zero Heartburn for the
next
24 hours,'" the judge wrote. P&amp;G did not immediately return
calls for comment.
Prilosec was once the world's best selling prescription
drug, generating over $6 billion in sales in 2000. However,
Prilosec's manufacturer, AstraZeneca, lost its patent on
the
drug last year.

Family planning groups want the Government to relax
restrictions on the use of the controversial abortion pill
RU-486 despite the news that a fifth young woman has died
after the taking the drug.
The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, backed by the
Family
Planning Association, has asked the Department of Health to
cut the number of times a woman has to see a doctor in
order
to complete the procedure.

However, the move was greeted with alarm in America, where
the latest death occurred.

Senior gynaecologists there warned about the drug's safety
and argued that relaxing restrictions would increase the
risk to British women.
Their comments came after Holly Patterson, 18, from
California, died earlier this month from septic shock, a
week after taking RU-486 to abort her unborn baby. Four
other women have died due to bleeding or infection linked
to
the drug in France and the United States since its
introduction in 1988.
Dr Donna Harrison, a gynaecologist in Michigan, said
yesterday: "Regardless of their views on abortion there are
many doctors who are concerned about the safety of RU-486.
"There are so many things than can go wrong. There can be
bleeding serious enough for transfusions to be needed.
There
is also a serious risk of infection. If you don't want to
see a Holly Patterson in Britain you should reject any
moves
to relax medical supervision of these drugs."

Animal models for human disease play an important role in understanding the 
causes and mechanisms of genetic disorders and are invaluable in developing 
new treatments and therapeutics. These animals are produced by several 
techniques, including transgene insertion and targeted gene knockout in 
embryos to generate new lines, but the subsequent crossbreeding and 
necessary genotyping make these time-consuming strategies. The generation of 
embryonic stem cell lines from genetically engineered embryos combined with 
somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is routinely used to produce animal 
clones with a known genotype from which further stocks can be bred and has 
been used with success in the production of sheep and mice. However, the 
production of cloned rats has been unsuccessful due to technical 
difficulties associated with spontaneous oocyte activation that occurs 
within an hour of egg collection.

In the September 25 Science, Qi Zhou and colleagues in a collaboration among 
Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, and the biotech company genOway report the first successful 
production of cloned rats using a technique that reversibly blocks meiotic 
metaphase&#x2013;anaphase transition in the oocyte and allows the successful uptake 
of transferred somatic cell nuclei (Science, DOI:10.1126/science.1088313, 
September 25, 2003).

"It is a real scientific collaboration between an academic group headed by 
J.P. Renard and a biotech company team," Alexandre Fraichard, chief 
executive officer of genOway, told The Scientist by E-mail. "Both partners 
provided expertise and technologies."

The team reported earlier attempts to develop a rapid, single-step, nuclear 
transfer technique, but found that within 30 minutes of collection, 70% of 
oocytes showed evidence of maturation. And while 201 out of 221 apparently 
successfully cloned embryos divided into two-cell embryos, no fetal 
development was observed in any of them.

Her impending divorce and its aftermath not only left Boulder school

The 8-year-old cat began acting out this spring in ways he'd never done. What 
he did is politely known as inappropriate elimination, and cat owners 
everywhere know what that means.
On the dog's bed. On the bathroom rug. On the carpet. Once he even went on 
White's foot! Even worse, White was attempting to sell the house, and she feared 
that Winston's frequent anointings would deter potential buyers.
Her other cat didn't behave this way. But Winston is a sensitive soul, 
extremely bonded to his owner. "My stress turned into my cat's stress," said White, 
50.
Her veterinarian prescribed Valium to calm Winston down. "I thought if I 
vegged him out enough he'd forget he was mad," White said. "But it was not 
working. Either I gave him so much he was like a vegetable, or I didn't give him 
enough to make a difference."
Something had to be done. And it's precisely at this point - when a pet's 
misdeeds become intolerable - that many cat owners throw in the towel and throw 
out the cat.
"If a dog has behavior problems, you call a trainer. But if cats develop 
behavior problems, most people think you can't do anything about it. Cats have 
always been considered untrainable," says Dr. Jean Hofve, a Denver veterinarian 
who specializes in treating felines. "So people just live with it until finally 
the cat is out on his ear or winds up in the shelter."
But Hofve and her business partner, animal behaviorist Jackson Galaxy, 
believe something can be done if pet owners will start thinking like cats.
Hofve and Galaxy recently launched Little Big Cat, a cat-behavior consulting 
practice. They look at both the physical and the emotional explanations for a 
cat's behavior and suggest holistic treatments that take those factors into 
account.
In Winston's case, that meant taking some very practical steps, like moving 
his litter boxes around and putting his food bowl in the places where he was 
spraying, and some less obvious ones, like getting him a toy he can chase and 
pounce on.

Driving down the street the other day, I noticed yet again the struggling
little band of die-hard slogan jockeys outside the courthouse.

This told me that it must be sometime between 5 and 6 p.m. A moment later
I became depressed and supremely angry.

One should not be able to set his watch by the actions of activists. This
isn't a politically motivated crusade. It's a plea for attention and
approval from the impotent.

"Hey! Look at us, we're over here doing our part!"

If doing your part to change the world consists of informing the same
passersby day in and day out of tired, obvious truths such as war equals
oil, then we need to try another approach.
...
One of the most encouraging stories I've heard in the last few months
comes from California.

At Clippinger Chevrolet, a dealership in the Los Angeles area, a fire was
deliberately set which destroyed a significant number of SUVs as well as a
warehouse.

Slogans such as "I (heart) Pollution" and "Fat Lazy Americans" could be
seen spraypainted on some vehicles. This work has been claimed by a group
calling itself the ELF, or Earth Liberation Front.
...
As far as I can tell, no fiendish drunkards or smokers were apprehended at
the scene, and there were no shots fired. But the message is clear
nonetheless. If a rich person gets his toys broken, rest assured scores of
other rich persons will slink out of the shadows to lend a hand and ensure
the imprisonment of the evil culprits.

So what exactly qualifies these people as terrorists?

Vandals certainly, arsonists yes, but terrorists? No.
...
These people are not terrorists, they're heroes. At least they're taking
some real, effective action, which is more than can be said for the
depressingly large majority of "activists" these days.

Federal agents are seeking a Sonoma man -- the son of a Bay Area city
official -- in connection with recent bombings at companies in Emeryville
and Pleasanton, the FBI announced Thursday.

A criminal complaint against Daniel Andreas San Diego, 25, was filed in
federal court Sunday but remains under seal by a judge's order. An FBI
news release issued Thursday says San Diego is char-ged with "maliciously
damaging and destroying, and attempting to destroy and damage, by means of
explosives, buildings and other property."

That's a fancy way of saying agents believe San Diego placed the two bombs
that exploded Aug. 28 outside Chiron Corp. at 5400 Hollis St., Emeryville,
and one that exploded Sept. 26 outside Shak-lee Corp. at 4747 Willow Road,
Pleasanton. He's now a fugitive, and if caught and convicted, could face
up to 10 years in federal prison for each bombing.
...
E-mail communiques passed through animal-rights groups after the bombings
said the companies were attacked because they've associated with
Huntingdon Life Sciences, a British laboratory firm that uses animals for
testing and has become the target of an international activist movement,
Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC).

Biotech firm Chiron said it has used Huntingdon in the past but no longer
does. Shaklee -- a producer of vitamin, personal hygiene and household
cleaning products -- does no animal testing, but parent company Yamanouchi
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. uses Huntingdon's services. 
...
Former FBI agent Rick Smith, who worked in the bureau's San Francisco
office during the Unabomber investigation, said he sees parallels between
this investigation and that which concluded with the arrest and conviction
of Ted Kaczynski. In both, he said, the wording and syntax in the claims
of responsibility for the bombings must have moved the case forward.

"This guy is way over the extreme edge," Smith said of the e-mails sent
following the Emeryville and Pleasanton bombings. "The more language
investigators have, the easier it is to identify people. It's usually one
person, not a group, so the writings help because now you can do a profile."

FAIRHAVEN -- Anita Hawkins' bloody reign on Main Street began about three
years ago, when the trim and tan sophisticate was 75 years old.

A neighbor left bread out for neighborhood squirrels, setting off an invasion.

Soon, there were great hordes of the gray-furred rodents, said Mrs.
Hawkins, marauding gangs of squirrels who scampered over her garage,
leaped into her yard, robbed her bird feeders and clawed along the very
walls of the Thomas Delano House -- circa 1790 -- which she has called
home for more than a decade when she and her husband are not at their
other residence on the island of St. Thomas.

And so she began to kill them.

She set traps for them -- Havahart brand traps -- and caught them by the
hundreds.

Then she drowned them in a green plastic trash barrel out back she had
filled with water for that very purpose.

"It snuffs them right out," she declared of the water treatment. "I called
an exterminator and that's what they say they do. They call it 'teaching
them to swim.'"

She bought a pair of Daisy air rifle pellet guns and soon she became an
enviable shot. She dispatched squirrels with shots through the bars of her
traps and she has potted them in her small back yard. 
...
Yesterday, the national animal rights organization People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) wrote a letter urging the Fairhaven police to
charge Mrs. Hawkins with animal cruelty.

"There's nothing in the law to prevent her from killing an animal that's a
threat to her property," conceded PETA wildlife biologist Stephanie
Boyles. "But that's clearly not why she's doing it. She's doing it for
fun. The body count is just way too high."

Her preferred method of killing -- drowning -- is inhumane, claims PETA,
and results in a slow, agonizing death for the animals. Also, BB guns
often only wound animals, leaving them to die over time.

Police Chief Gary Souza could not be reached for comment yesterday. But
police are aware of the situation and have been called on at least two
occasions to broker truces between Mrs. Hawkins and her next-door
neighbors over the squirrel issue.

The parents of a 25-year-old animal rights activist wanted on suspicion of
bombing two Bay Area businesses have contacted a prominent San Francisco
attorney in hopes of persuading their son to surrender to charges that, if
proved, could put him in prison for up to 30 years.

The family of Daniel Andreas San Diego of Schellville in Sonoma County
issued an appeal Friday urging him to contact attorney Jim Collins and
surrender immediately to federal authorities.

Collins is a criminal defense attorney who has been involved in a number
of high-profile cases, most recently one involving three off-duty San
Francisco police officers accused of assaulting two men on Union Street
when they refused to hand over a take-home bag of fajitas. 
...
An animal rights group calling itself Revolutionary Cells claimed
responsibility for the blasts in anonymous e-mails and said the two
companies were targeted because of their ties to Huntingdon Life Sciences.
The New Jersey company conducts drug and chemical experiments on animals
for other firms, including Shaklee's parent company, Yamanouchi Consumer
Inc., and Chiron.
...
In a statement e-mailed to The Chronicle, Edmund San Diego and his wife,
Heike, asked their son to contact Collins to pave the way for his surrender.

"We continue to be bewildered by the situation as it unfolds and still
know little more than what we read or see in the press," the couple said. 
...
The suspect worked for two years at In Defense of Animals, a nonprofit in
Mill Valley, when he was about 19 years old, said group founder Elliot
Katz, a veterinarian.

"He was a very gentle human being who cared very deeply about animals,"
Katz said. "He seemed like he was totally nonviolent. He wouldn't hurt a
fly, let alone a human being." 
...
Danielle Matthews, a spokesperson at Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty in New
Jersey, cast aspersions on the FBI probe, while distancing her group from
San Diego. "We've never heard of him, and those East Bay bombings were
carried out anonymously. Other than their repeated failings in the past,
we don't have any indication that the FBI are more on target this time."

Animal Control Agencies Hail Mount Airy Operation For Equine Expertise 

The new arrivals were in critical shape. The mother's backbone was a 
prominent, knobby ridge, her ribs starkly outlined. The two-week-old was covered with 
open sores and so weak it was uncertain he would live another day. 
The horses received immediate treatment and were monitored through that first 
anxious night. Three months later, American Allie, as the chestnut mare is 
called, has gained more than 200 pounds and Zepplin, her colt, is a 
rambunctious, newly weaned three-month-old. In a few months, they will go to new homes and 
new adoptive owners, shedding their past lives at a Prince George's County 
farm. Allan and Kathleen Schwartz will see to that. 
The couple operates Days End Farm Horse Rescue, the refuge of last resort for 
some of the sorriest victims of animal abuse and neglect in Maryland. Animal 
control officers across the state call for help from the 14-year-old operation 
in western Howard County when they seize horses whose owners are accused of 
endangering their animals. 
It's a problem that's growing with the state's sizable equine population, now 
estimated at more than 87,000. Although there are rescue operations in 
Maryland that take retired racehorses or buy horses to save them from 
slaughterhouses, only Days End has forged a close partnership with animal control and 
emergency response agencies. 
Before Days End, "we made do, but not as well as we do with Days End," said 
Charles County Animal Control Chief Ed Tucker.

        <docText>The 10-year-old considers the question - How long have you
been a vegetarian? -and offers a thoughtful answer.

"About a year and a half," he says between bites of baby carrots. "What
really did it for me was I read the book, `Fast Food Nation,' and it
describes in there how the meat is killed. It's really gross."
...
Cindy Lawler, child nutrition director for Asheville City Schools, says
last year Dickson Elementary bought twice as much produce as another
comparably sized elementary school, Claxton Elementary. Dickson receives
more fresh fruit and vegetables than any other Asheville elementary school.

The vegetarian trend, or kids being interested in more vegetables and
fruits, continues to grow slowly systemwide, though.

"We have seen more and more vegetarian students," Lawler said. "I've been
here going on eight years now, and I would say there's been a gradual
increase every year. It's not a huge jump from year to year, but it is
growing."

It's difficult to put a specific number on vegetarians because the schools
don't serve "vegetarian meals" specifically. And a lot of kids opt to
bring their own lunch.

"If I'm forced to eat the school lunch I will, and if I do I take the
salad bar and don't eat meat," said Holden Beale, 10, a Dickson fifth-grader.
...
"It usually costs more than twice the amount for a school system to serve
a veggie burger than a meat hamburger," said Jennifer Keller, a registered
dietician and the author of the annual school lunch report put out by the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a Washington, D.C.,
nonprofit that promotes preventive medicine and a vegetarian diet.

The Cuyahoga Valley National Park soon will begin a study on white-tailed 
deer that could lead to sharpshooters killing the animals, perhaps in two years.
The National Park Service intends to begin the 18- to 24-month study later 
this year, park Superintendent John Debo said.
The deer problem in the Cuyahoga Valley has not gone away, he said, and 
officials feel the herd must be reduced to protect the park's plants and animals.
``We still have a very high deer population in parts of the valley,'' he 
said. ``... The problem is as real as it was a few years ago.''
The study -- called an environmental impact statement -- will include 
considerable public participation in formulating a deer-management plan for the 
33,000-acre park.
Debo said it's presumptuous to say that sharpshooters will be used because 
the upcoming federal study will consider ``all feasible alternatives'' for 
reducing deer numbers.
In 1997, park officials wanted to use sharpshooters to kill 470 deer. But 
that effort was blocked by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., after 
animal-rights activists sued to stop the killing.
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman said the park service had failed to make a 
convincing case that shooting deer would not have a negative impact.
At least two national animal rights' groups are keeping an eye on what 
happens in the Cuyahoga Valley park.
Heidi Prescott, national director for the New York-based Fund for Animals, 
one of the groups involved in the 1997 suit, intends to ask the fund's lawyers 
to closely review the park service plans.
``We're still interested in opposing hunting in the national park,'' she 
said. ``Hunting is only a Band-Aid approach to controlling the deer population.''

Las Vegas &#x2014; Ildiko Pataki, a veteran acrobat of the Siegfried &amp; Roy show, 
heard a loud commotion and instantly knew something had gone badly wrong at 
The Mirage. Minutes later, Pataki watched as paramedics rolled out a 
bloodied Roy Horn on a stretcher. What many feared could happen had finally 
happened to the Las Vegas icon during a sold-out performance: A tiger had 
mauled him. "I was just petrified," said Pataki, 42, who had been with the 
show for 14 years. "I still cannot tell you how I feel about it. It was a 
nightmare."

Pataki was one of more than 200 people, many of them show employees, who 
turned out for a candlelight vigil Sunday night at University Medical 
Center, where co-headliner Horn is being treated. Horn, 59, suffered a 
severe wound to his neck when the 7-year-old male named Montecore attacked 
without warning Friday night in front of hundreds of people. Nobody was sure 
Horn would survive, but MGM officials finally delivered some good news at 
the vigil. MGM Mirage Resort CEO Bobby Baldwin said Horn's prognosis had 
improved. Doctors told Baldwin that Horn, who was in critical condition, 
could move his hands and feet and also gave a thumbs-up sign.

Those who attended chanted, "We love you Roy!" and held their candles in the 
direction of his hospital room. They described the people who worked in the 
show as a "tight-knit family" that had been rocked twice. First, they almost 
lost Horn. And now they had lost their jobs. With the co-headliner's future 
uncertain, MGM Mirage officials told the show's 267 employees Saturday night 
to look for new employment. MGM Mirage officials said the show was "closed 
indefinitely." They added that even if Horn recovers, it's unclear whether 
he would ever be able to perform again in the rigorous show. "We are not 
going to sugarcoat this," MGM Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman said.

If the youngsters in your household are under 7 years old, they are usually 
not developmentally suited for puppies 5 months old and under, or toy-sized 
dogs (under 15 pounds) of any age. 
Puppies have ultra sharp "milk teeth'' and toenails and often teethe on or 
scratch children, resulting in unintentional injury to the child. The puppy 
becomes something to be feared rather than loved. 
Toy dogs are fine-boned, touch-sensitive creatures that do not weather rough 
or clumsy handling well. They break relatively easy and are quicker to bite 
than large boned, mellower canines. A medium to large dog over 5 months old is 
usually the safer choice. 
Who will be the dog's primary caretaker? 
Some parents bow to the pressure their children put on them to get a dog. The 
kids promise that they will religiously take care of their soon to be best 
friend, but you cannot saddle a child with total responsibility for the family 
dog or threaten to "get rid of it'' if the child is not providing that care. 
It is not fair to the child or dog.

ALHFAM seeks papers for presentations, panels or workshops for its 2004
Annual Meeting in Dearborn, Michigan. ALHFAM is an organization of people
who bring history to life. ALHFAM enables it members to make history a
valuable part of the lives of museum visitors. It achieves this purpose
through the exchange and sharing of ideas, information, tools and
experiences centered around accurate, active, participatory, object-based
historical interpretation. ALHFAM, through its membership, is committed to
leading museum interpreters, educators, researchers, administrators,
curators and volunteers in these fields: historical agriculture, historical
trades and manufacturing, historical clothing and foodways, living history
programming, historic site administration, care of collections, and program
delivery within the above specialties.

The theme for 2004, "Sustaining History: Valuing Tradition And Sharing
Innovation," draws on Henry Ford's interest in history and his tradition of
balancing resourcefulness and innovation. At this ALHFAM Annual Meeting,
held in the seventy-fifth year of The Henry Ford, we welcome sessions
related to the tried-and-true or the fantastically new, and how the concept
of sustainability may be interwoven in our programs, institutions, and
communities. As such, we encourage sessions considering how our
organizations and members can promote practices that rely on more
sustainable principles and behavior in a multitude of ways.

Proposals should include a one-page summary of each presentation and a
resume for each presenter. Presenters are expected to submit their
presentation in written form at the conference. Selected papers will be
published in the Conference Proceedings

Kirkpatrick Sale referred to me and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society 
in
his Sept. 29 commentary on the Earth Liberation Front, "These Elves Are Up
to More Than Mischief." He wrote that "ecotage," or eco-sabotage, began in
this country in 1977 when
I founded the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Sea Shepherd operates
outside of the U.S. primarily, and the organization has undertaken only one
action within the territory of the U.S., a completely legal opposition to
illegal whaling by the Makah tribe in
Washington state in 1998 and 1999.

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been established as an
international marine wildlife conservation organization for almost three
decades. We don't commit crimes, and we do not support the use of criminal
tactics in our activities. We specialize in intervention against illegal
activities that exploit marine wildlife in international waters, where we
are empowered to intervene in accordance with the U.N. World Charter for
Nature. I resent the implication that our legal intervention against
high-seas poaching,
sea turtle poaching, illegal whaling, illegal drift nets and long lines and
the unlawful killing of baby seals can be connected to illegal crimes of
arson and sabotage committed by unknown perpetrators whom I don't know and
don't care to know. The least Sale could
have done was pick up a phone to question me directly or refer to

These Elves Are Up to More Than Mischief
  The 'terrorist' fringe of the environmental movement is likely to cause
only destruction, not progress.

By Kirkpatrick Sale


The Earth Liberation Front's war to "stop the exploitation of the natural
world" has been escalating in recent weeks. A condominium complex being
built in San Diego was destroyed Aug. 1, SUV/Hummer dealerships in Los
Angeles County and Sante Fe, N.M., were attacked in August and early
September, and last week six homes under construction were torched, again 
in
San Diego County. Altogether the cost is estimated at $54 million, the most
extensive damage in any two months since ELF began its campaign of economic
sabotage in 1996.

The FBI calls all of this "domestic terrorism" and has even designated ELF
as the nation's No. 1 domestic terrorism threat. But ELFers-or elves, as
they sometimes call themselves-are not typical terrorists; they 
specifically
declare themselves to be "against harming any animal, human or nonhuman."
Their actions are aimed only at property, and in this they stand in a long
tradition of sabotage as political and economic protest, going back at 
least
as far as the Luddites in 19th century Britain. It's a tradition, though,
that does not provide much support for the idea that they will achieve 
their
goals, however much destruction they enact.

ELF's main goal is to inflict financial damage on property owned by people
seen, as an ELF statement has it, as "profiteering from the destruction and
exploitation of the natural environment" - whether by urban sprawl, the
motivation for the San Diego attacks, or air pollution, as with the 
Hummers.
Thus they hope to hit corporations, and the government agencies that aid
them, in "their pocketbooks," stopping specific eco-transgressions in the
short run but ultimately bringing down "capitalism and the mind-set that
allows it to exist." So far they claim to have inflicted more than $100
million worth of damage in eight years, which must seem a significant 
figure
to them, though it represents only a small part of the net worth of the
corporations they target and doesn't seem to be doing away with sprawl,
pollution or corporate capitalism.

Their second purpose is to encourage more people to take similar direct
action. "More and more actions need to be taken," an ELF statement says, 
"to
create an actual movement that continues to grow to successfully stop the
destruction of life." ELFers are not much interested in making people aware
of the abstract issues of development or deforestation or trying to help
mainstream environmental groups push through reforms, all of which they
scorn. "With one night's work," as they put it, "a few individuals can
accomplish what years of legal battles and millions of dollars most likely
did not."

And that really is all that ELF is: people deciding on their own, singly or
in small groups, to sabotage a target in their neighborhood that has
symbolic environmental meaning. It is not an organization. It doesn't have 
a
headquarters or officers or members, and it doesn't hold meetings or
marches. (It does, as seems inevitable these days, have a Web site.) Anyone
who wants to go out and set fire to an SUV dealership and then spray paint
"ELF" on the wreckage is an ELFer, and the motivation will be presumed to 
be
environmental and not, say, revenge or the insurance money.

This style of activism was borrowed from a group called the Animal
Liberation Front, which began in Britain in the mid-1970s and spread to the
United States, possibly by some of the same people.

Environmental sabotage - "ecotage," as it is sometimes called, or
"monkeywrenching" - goes back in this country at least to 1977, when Paul
Watson broke from Greenpeace to start the Sea Shepherd Conservation 
Society,
which has taken credit for incapacitating illegal fishing ships and
inflicting $2 million worth of damage to a whale-processing plant in
Iceland. And for a decade after its founding in 1980, Earth First!, like
ELF, encouraged anonymous ecotage, but it downplayed it in the early 1990s
because as a group with offices and meetings, it was too open to police
attention.

Thus the way was open for a group like ELF. It struck first in October 1996
in Oregon, where locks were glued shut and buildings spray-painted at
McDonald's outlets and a PR firm for Weyerhaeuser and Hyundai and a U.S.
Forest Service pickup truck was torched. More than 70 actions took place
across the country over the next seven years, perhaps the most spectacular
being the $25-million arson in October 1998 at a ski resort being built in
Vail, Colo., over fierce local environmental opposition. If ELF's goal,
however, is nothing less than the eradication of the capitalist system, it
is unlikely that ecotage will be the means. The problem is not with its
analysis, for indeed this is a system that depletes and exploits the 
Earth's
resources with scant regard for byproducts of pollution or extinction or
climate change. But - moral considerations aside - it is hard to see how
local economic sabotage can be an effective method of change.

ELFers may imagine that people will become outraged enough at our present
undoubtedly catastrophic assault on the Earth's environment to set fire to
SUV dealerships across the country, but the historical record shows little
reason to believe that this would stop the production of those cars, much
less destroy the Detroit manufacturers or the economic system itself.

Of course when your target is, essentially, Western civilization, it is 
hard
to know what strategy would work.

A man claims a woman wrongly adopted his lost 
parrot and he can prove it if given a chance to question the bird in court. 
Loulou, an 11-year-old African gray parrot, flew out of David DeGroff's 
apartment on April 12 after a guest who wasn't wearing her glasses accidentally 
walked into the screen door leading to the balcony.
On May 11, Nina Weaver, of Newburg, Pa., adopted an African gray from the 
D.C. Animal Shelter. DeGroff, convinced the bird is Loulou, filed a lawsuit 
seeking an opportunity to depose the parrot. He is seeking $15,000 for pain and 
suffering if the bird turns out to be Loulou.

According to DeGroff, Loulou's vocal repertoire includes whistling the theme 
song to "The Andy Griffith Show" and saying the phrase "Daddy's gotta go to 
work."

 The redhead walking by let him know that there were others like him.

"It's OK," she said, leaving the kitchen after rinsing her dish. "I eat fish."

Still, Matt Bornstein-Grove, 20, was the only poultry- and red-meat eater
at the Tacoma Veggies potluck last month. He had come with other
University of Puget Sound students because he was thinking of converting,
and now he was surrounded by nearly 25 people, mostly vegans who regard
animal and animal-tested products as murderous or abusive.

It isn't that he disagrees with their convictions.

"It's just laziness on my part," he said. "I feel like if I'm going to do
it, I have to become committed on all fronts - become more aware of how
things are made, buy from responsible companies."

It's a tall order. Veganism, the strictest vegetarian lifestyle, eschews
not only meat, fish and dairy but also gelatin, cashmere, glycerin, honey,
keratin and wax. Veganism means no leather boots, no gummy bears, no
Tylenol Gelcaps.

The vegans at this potluck dinner drew the line at microbes, which meant
they weren't opposed to drinking beer. But the drinks for this mostly
underaged crew were Silk soymilk and Silk chocolate soymilk. And the
atmosphere inside the house near Sixth Avenue was granola, bare feet
outnumbering lipsticked lips.</docText>

Rhinelander - Beneath a cluster of stumps spread over a grassy flat, the
fungi are finishing the job, completing the annihilation of much of a
life's work.

For 18 years, U.S. Forest Service researcher Don Riemenschneider had
raised and documented 500 poplars, devoting such attention to them that
the trees became, he said, like his children. Over the decades, his
technical and time-consuming labors to breed resistance to a certain
cottonwood canker went largely unwatched.

Except, that is, by the "Elves."

In the darkness of July 20, 2000, members of the Earth Liberation Front
(ELF) crept onto the grounds of the Rhinelander Forest Service research
station and mauled the trees that Riemenschneider had known since they
were buds.
...
These activists, condemned by much of the mainstream environmental
movement and belonging to such groups as ELF, the Animal Liberation Front
(ALF) and a newly emerging group calling itself Revolutionary Cells, have
claimed responsibility for bombing research laboratories, torching posh
housing developments, releasing animals, cutting brake lines and sending
razors and threats to those whom they consider ideological enemies.
...
In recent weeks, California animal-rights activist Rick Bogle, who lived
for a time in the 1990s in Jefferson, Wis., sent threatening form e-mails
to several researchers at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center
in Madison, suggesting that they be jailed.

"Greetings slime: No clearer example of evil incarnate exists than the
informed decision to use other primates in hurtful experimentation," he
wrote. " . . . Your elimination is justified."

In a phone interview, Bogle acknowledged sending the e-mail to hundreds of
researchers. He said the animal-rights movement has been radicalized by
frustration that many elements of the research community and the corporate
world - in the activists' view - fail to act ethically, and by the
public's failure to take notice.

"It was one of the largest fires I've ever seen," Mobley said this week,
recalling the destruction that raged on the mountain around him five years
ago today. "It looked like something exploded. You could tell there was no
way to stop it."

The fire launched an investigation that pulled in Boulder environmentalists.

It didn't occur to Mobley during the 14 hours he worked on the mountaintop
that the blaze was set by arsonists, he said.

Two days later, an anonymous message sent to news media outlets said the
fires were the work of the little-known Earth Liberation Front ? an attack
on a "greedy corporation" on behalf of the environment. 
...
For the shadowy ELF, known mainly by detectives investigating much smaller
attacks, most in the Northwest, the blaze was a coming-out party.

The group's emergence as the standard-bearer for the radical environmental
fringe continues to raise questions of whether the willingness to resort
to destruction aids the cause or threatens the environmental movement's
existence. 
...
FBI questions and the grand jury probe continued for more than a year. No
tie to the Vail fires or ELF ever emerged involving Doon, Ancient Forest
Rescue members or anyone else, that was strong enough to compel an indictment.

Doon calls the grand jury investigation a sort of "un-American
McCarthyism" and said the apparent fixation on Ancient Forest Rescue
probably hurt the investigation more than it helped. 
...
Investigators and environmental critics such as Arnold tend to overstate
the power and presence of ELF, he said.

Rod Coronado disagrees.

The 37-year-old Tucson resident is the unofficial spokesman for ELF and
one of the most high-profile figures from the radical animal-rights and
environmental world. Coronado was in federal prison at the time of the
Vail fires, serving four years after pleading guilty to helping a 1992
firebombing of a Michigan State University animal laboratory, one of a
string of attacks on university research labs.

Pair welcome abandoned, threatened animals to farm.
Emma had mistakenly been left in a pile of dead animals. 
And it's true, she was near death. But then she raised her head, and in that 
movement, she caught the attention of an angel.
That's how Emma's saga began. Along the way, the 9-year-old sheep has 
benefited from the compassion of more than one human angel. There was the person who 
rescued her from the pile of dead animals at the slaughterhouse in 
Pennsylvania. There were the people who took her to Farm Sanctuary, a shelter for rescued 
animals in upstate New York, where she was nursed back to health.

And now, she has David Welch and Lynn Alpern, who adopted her and took her to 
live with them, first in Maryland, then finally bringing her with them when 
they moved to this wooded oasis in the foothills.
Caring for this farmful of castoffs and rescuees costs the couple about 
$15,000 a year, not counting the cost of the land and buildings. And because caring 
for so many critters is a full-time job, Alpern stays home. Welch's salary 
must support them all.
"We do get generous donations from grocery stores," Alpern says. "I bring 
home a trunkful of food from Safeway five days a week. It's amazing how much food 
would be thrown out otherwise. But it provides a lot of treats for our birds 
and rabbits."

Recently, the Tallahassee Democrat published a column from a member of a 
local animal welfare group taking the Tallahassee-Leon Community Animal Service 
Center (TLCASC) to task regarding its work with animal rescue groups.
I'd like to share some information regarding TLCASC, which is a 
city-operated, animal welfare and rescue organization that takes in more than 10,000 
animals a year. In addition to housing and caring for these animals, we oversee 
animal control, humane education, volunteer involvement and animal adoption and 
fostering programs.
Our organization reunites lost animals with their owners, helps mediate 
disputes between neighbors involving animals, treats ill and injured animals and 
testifies in court regarding citations and animal abuse cases.
We have a caring team of employees and volunteers committed to helping find 
homes for unwanted and abandoned animals. We receive an average of 30 such 
animals a day, peaking to over 60 on some summer days. Many come to us wretchedly 
ill and in poor condition, and, within our limits, we provide the best care 
possible with a full measure of compassion and dedication.
In both March and September of this year, no adoptable dogs were euthanized 
at our facility. That is a tremendous tribute to our staff and, most 
importantly, our community - from citizens to volunteers to benefactors.
We have effectively changed how TLCASC works with local animal welfare 
groups. In the past, purebred and very adoptable dogs coming to the shelter would 
often be immediately turned over to one of these groups. In a city-run facility, 
designed to serve the public, these adoptable pets must be made available to 
the general public first. Accordingly, our new policy reflects this mandate.
The policy states that we can transfer an animal to a local animal welfare 
group after two weekends in the adoption ward for the standard adoption fee and 
at no cost after two months. This allows the shelter to better serve the 
public, while working with the animal welfare groups to ensure the best chances for 
the animals finding a home.

The San Francisco Bay is getting an ecological report card today -- and it 
doesn't look good. But there's hope behind the C's, D's and an F, according to 
the nonprofit environmental group that graded the bay's health. 
New laws and regulations that cut down on water pollution and a Bay Area 
campaign to restore wetlands are just beginning to stabilize 150 years of decline 
in the bay's once-abundant native fish and wildlife populations, according to 
the Bay Institute of San Francisco. 
"The destruction of San Francisco Bay's unique environment has in some cases 
been halted or even slightly reversed," said Grant Davis, Bay Institute 
executive director. 
To measure the health of the bay, scientists with the Bay Institute in Novato 
spent three years examining such things as wildlife habitat and pollutants, 
and prepared the Bay Index 2003. Scientists also looked at freshwater flows 
from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and the numbers of fish, shellfish and 
the microscopic plankton that feed these higher forms of aquatic life. 
The bay's grades -- one B, three C's, three D's and an F -- were based on 
historical conditions, environmental and public health standards, and restoration 
targets, according to the institute.

Franciscan friars of St. Boniface Church in the Tenderloin reverently offered 
their annual Blessing of the Animals ceremony on Sunday afternoon, Oct. 4, to 
dozens of dogs, cats, hamsters, turtles, parakeets, rabbits and other soulful 
beasts who graciously received the sacred prayers and the sprinkling of holy 
water. I saw no serpents here, but I did see four Guardian Angels wearing red 
berets and camouflage pants, plus mayoral candidate Angela Alioto, who 
schmoozed with the pastor. Mingling with the masses, I posed a crucial theological 
question. 
Excuse me, are you Father Floyd Lotito? You organized this event? Is today 
St. Francis of Assisi's birthday? 
Yes, I am Father Lotito. Today is St. Francis' Feast Day. It is actually the 
day that he died in 1226, but it also symbolizes his "birthday" with joining 
God in Heaven. 
St. Francis is the patron saint of animals. He saw all creation as part of a 
family, with animals as his brothers and sisters. There are many stories of 
his friendships with animals. The Wolf of Gubbio was terrorizing people, for 
example, but St. Francis made peace with him through dialogue and conversation. 
Do pets go to Heaven? 
All creation has been elevated through the incarnation of Jesus, and animals 
are part of creation.

I'm asking for your support in a poll of the "most overgrazed livestock 
allotments" in the U.S.  Run by my friend Larry Walker 
(http://rangenet.org/directory/walkerl), the poll is intended as a means 
to increase public awareness about the damage done by ranching to our 
public lands and also to focus attention on the government agencies that 
manage these lands.  Although all of the nominated allotments are worthy 
of the "most overgrazed" title I'm rooting for 3 of them.  (If you're 
not interested in reading the scenarios about the allotments, just skip 
to the voting instructions at the end.)

1) Diamond Bar Allotment (NM): In addition to all the threats to 
wildlife, including the endangered Gila Trout, the allotment is the 
subject of ongoing legal action.  The rancher permittee was thrown off 
the allotment in the late 1990s because he disagreed with government 
imposed cattle reductions and consequently refused to sign his permit. 
The allotment has been closed ever since.  This spring he put his cattle 
back on the allotment in defiance of the closure.  Despite protests by 
activists, the government has not acted against him (might have 
something to do with the Bush administration being sympathetic to 
ranchers).  Public attention focused on this allotment might motivate 
the government to act.

I first visited the allotment in 1997, then returned last July to 
photograph the recent damage that the illegal grazing had done.  I have 
a photopage as supporting evidence for the "overgrazed" condition of the 
allotment (http://rangenet.org/directory/hudakm/diamondbar/index.html)

2) Rock Creek/Mudholes Allotment (UT): Another allotment with ongoing 
legal action.  In 2000, rancher Mary Bulloch failed to comply with a 
government order to remove her cattle because of prolonged drought. 
After the government impounded her cattle, Bulloch arrived with about a 
dozen rancher friends who stole back the cattle.  For this reason and 
also because some trespass cattle remain on the allotment, Bulloch has 
accrued over $77,000 in fines and penalties.  Her case goes to trial in 
late November.  The more attention focused on the allotment the less 
chance that the government will cut a deal with Bulloch, perhaps 
massively reducing her fine and letting her once again grazing cattle on 
the allotment.

The multibillion-dollar business of buying and 
selling protected wildlife is one of the largest 
sources of criminal earnings, behind only arms 
smuggling and drug trafficking.The United 
States is the main destination for exotic and 
endangered wild animals. National, state, 
and local governments are passing laws that prohibit 
the capture and sale of certain species, but 
most of these regulations are poorly enforced 
and are designed to protect humans from disease 
rather than ensure that animals are handled humanely.

It can be difficult to sort out what government 
regulations exist to control the influx of 
exotic animals into the U.S. Endangered species 
are supposed to be monitored by the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS), but smugglers find 
ways around inspections. Protected species may 
be hidden among legal animals or dangerous species 
of animals so that officers are less likely to 
thoroughly hand-inspect shipments. The FWS 
also suffers from a lack of resources: With the 
number of inspectors, we are able to physically 
inspect 25% of wildlife shipments, says one federal 
wildlife inspector. Penalties for violations 
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) are stipulated by individual countries, 
and the punishments range from short jail sentences 
to fines. People simply pay [the fine] and continue 
to break the law, according to one CITES representative.

Authorities seized a man in June, 1992 who had paid 
$1,000 for a gorilla and $500 for a chimpanzee.  In 
1990, the wholesale price of a pair of young orangutans 
was $15,000.  In 1989, the value of chimps to biomedical 
research was about $25,000.  The monetary stakes are high.

Collie Carnes, spokesperson for the Society for the 
Prevention of Mistreatment of Animals (SPOMA), says 
their organization's efforts reach beyond the US borders.
"We must stop the illegal sales where they are happening
on a daily basis. SPOMA works with CITES to provide 
them information to stop the cruelty.  SPOMA works with
internationally influential people, like Luella Vedric, 
who is helping us track notorious outfits--like Assan Circus 
in Africa--to stop continued abuses."

        <docText>Call it White House meets Wild Kingdom.

Conservationists are angry over a Bush administration proposal that would
allow the importation of animals listed on the United States' endangered
species list, a move they say will further cripple the species' dwindling
populations.

The fate of exotic animals and their treatment at the hands of hunters,
animal shows or leather-goods merchants has been raised in recent weeks
after Roy Horne of Siegfried and Roy, a wildly popular Las Vegas show
featuring live tigers, was critically injured when one of the animals
mauled him on stage before a live audience.

And then there was 31-year-old Antoine Yates who was discovered keeping a
350-pound Bengal tiger and an alligator in his Harlem, N.Y., apartment.
Police had to shoot the tiger with tranquilizer darts to subdue him and
remove him to a sanctuary.

Both cases illustrate the nation's fascination with wild and exotic animals.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing a relaxation of
regulations that prohibit the transport of live animals considered
endangered in other countries. That would mean hunters and merchants who
trade in animal skins, tusks and other body parts would be able to go
after their prized prey unquestioned.
...
 "There are a lot of other ways to bring in revenue rather than to place a
price tag on endangered species to allow them to be killed or captured,"
said Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of The Humane Society of the
United States.

HSUS says the international commercial wildlife trade is worth billions of
dollars every year and has been responsible for the decline of wild
populations of a number of species of animals and plants.
...
However, Pacelle said of hunters, "There is a far larger universe of
people interested in watching wildlife in their native habitats than there
are wealthy trophy hunters who want to shoot endangered species. This is a
relatively small subset of the American population."

Lopez: What, in your experience, do the "greens" make of you ? a
conservative, Republican-administration vet, sticking his neck out on
animal rights?

Scully: Let me be the first on NRO to break the story that there are
actually other Republicans concerned about cruelty to animals. Outgoing
Senator Bob Smith was a true champion of compassion for animals, but
others remain such as Senator Wayne Allard and Representative Chris Smith.
The same is true in the U.K., where many Tories have favored the abolition
of veal farming, battery cages, fur farming, fox hunting, and hare
coursing among other cruel practices and vicious recreations. As for
environmentalists, I think they generally approve of the book, and I am
glad that I've come to know some of them, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
He is a brave foe of factory farmers, for both environmental and
animal-welfare reasons. I count myself his ally, as do the thousands of
farmers still worthy of that name.

Lopez: When people ? conservatives ? hear "animal rights" they often think
of Peter Singer. Are you in part attempting to get the arguments away from
the likes of Singer?

Scully: I start with a respect for anyone who gives serious attention to
the matter, and to their credit animal rights groups are often the ones
who bring the problems of cruelty to our attention. I think for example of
one group that smuggled a camera into a packing plant a few years ago.
Their footage showed awful things like cows being carved up alive and
squealing pigs being dropped into scalding tanks, which happens every day.
For their efforts, they get derided as meddlesome radicals, crackpots, or
what have you. But I think such people show great courage, and do us a
service.

Just recently, there has been a storm in cola bottles, with pesticides
being unearthed in soft drinks, adulterated spices, contaminants found in
bottled drinking water and now high levels of toxicity in some vegetables
 . Everyone is appalled and staring at their lunch and wondering if it is
edible, while the media are raising a general hue and cry about the whole
issue.

But what is really strange is that no one seems to be concerned about the
contaminants in meat, fish, chicken, eggs and dairy products. It is worth
thinking that if vegetables, water and spices have such high levels of
toxicity in them, the levels in the unhealthy, bacteria-laden meat that
people consume have to be off the scale.

In fact, meat-eaters have far more to worry about than vegetarians. Animal
products have more than 90 per cent of the toxic chemical residues as
compared to only 10 per cent in fruits and vegetables. It is a known fact
that non-vegetarians suffer more frequently from various types of food
poisoning than vegetarians. 
...
In fact, a study done by the US Department of Agriculture  found that 99
per cent of broiler carcasses have detectable levels of E. coli bacteria,
and their presence is an indicator of faecal contamination. If these are
the figures in the US, then imagine in India, where even the minimum
animal welfare regulations are being ignored?
...
People who follow a vegan diet,  whose meals are made from a variety of
grain foods (bread, cereal, rice, pastas), vegetables, legumes, fruits and
nuts, have dramatically less risk of contracting a bacterial infection
than those who eat meat and dairy products. Any health care ?expert? worth
his or her salt, including officials at the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine and the leading dietary associations, will tell you
that plant-based foods are better for our health than animal products, and
it goes without saying that vegetarian foods are more humane.
...
During a photo shoot, model/actor Aditi Govitrikar told People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals? representative, ?If you eat chicken or other
meat, you?re consuming toxins, fat and cholesterol. Veg food is powered
with all the vitamins and protein you need to be at your best?. Who can
argue with that?

Vegan and macrobiotic diets have led to the return of rickets in Britain,
according to experts. They say cases among children are rising, more than
50 years after the disease was virtually eradicated by better health and
nutrition.

Doctors have blamed a variety of factors, including the fact that children
are failing to get enough vitamin D, either because they are fed too much
junk food or are on vegan and macrobiotic diets which ban dairy products.
Fears over skin cancer mean that children are not being exposed to enough
direct sunlight, another source of vitamin D. Children who are left in
daycare facilities for long periods, where they spend most of the time
indoors, may also be more vulnerable.

Brian Wharton, an adviser to the Government and the World Health
Organisation on child nutrition, highlighted the return of rickets in a
paper published in the medical journal The Lancet. He said: "An old
problem of nutritional child health, once thought vanquished, has resurfaced."
...
There are an estimated 250,000 vegans in Britain, and increasing numbers
of people are following the type of macrobiotic diet favoured by
celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. One in 10 teenaged girls
are vegetarian or vegan, according to the Food Standards Agency.

Earlier this year, a New York couple were convicted of endangering the
life of their 15-month-old daughter by subjecting her to a strict vegan
diet which left her malnourished and suffering from rickets. Silva Swinton
and her husband Joseph were jailed after what was seen as a test case for
parents who put their children on such diets.

A spokesman for The Vegan Society said: "Being vegan is a health and a
moral choice, and a vegan diet can be followed without suffering from
vitamin loss."

How long have you been working with PETA? What are its objectives? 
I've been with PETA for four years. PETA was founded over 20 years ago by 
Ingrid Newkirk, and our headquarters are in Norfolk, Va. We have 750,000-plus 
members -- we're the largest animal rights group in the world. PETA believes that 
animals are not ours to eat, to wear, to experiment on or to use for 
entertainment. The underlying goal of PETA is to encourage people to be vegetarian. We 
work to improve the conditions of animals that are used for food, but, 
ultimately, we believe that animals should not be food. 
How long have you been a vegetarian? 
I've been vegetarian for 13 years and vegan for five years. I quit eating 
meat when I was 16 -- that was the year that we did animal dissection in my high 
school biology class in New Jersey. The dead animals were getting bigger and 
bigger, from earthworms to frogs, and, finally, the teacher brought out a fetal 
pig. That night, my mom served ham for dinner, and I was completely repulsed. 
I started reading "Animal Liberation," by Peter Singer, and his arguments 
supported my gut feeling that eating animals was not right. 
What are your specific duties as national campaign coordinator for PETA? 
I work primarily on the antifur campaign. Our most recent action took place 
in New York City, on opening night at the Metropolitan Opera. People 
traditionally show their fur coats at this event, so we had 15 activists there who were 
holding the bloody carcasses of skinned foxes, and signs that said, "Here's 
the rest of your fur coat." I love these kinds of demonstrations -- actions that 
are shocking but appropriate. The point we're trying to make is that each fox 
coat generates 40 fox carcasses. 
Last winter, we also did a fur protest in Park City, Utah. We showed up at 
the Freestyle World Championship wearing just ski caps and skis, carrying signs 
that said, "We'd Rather Ski Naked Than Wear Fur." 
I imagine that you and other PETA activists get tons of attention when you 
don't have much on. 
Yes. That's why we do it: to get media attention for PETA's causes. I didn't 
like standing outside naked in 30-degree weather -- it's absolutely crazy! But 
we did it for the animals. 
Tell me about your Lettuce Lady costume. Did you design it? 
I didn't invent the costume. I am just one of many who have donned the 
Lettuce Lady costume for PETA. Our most recent Lettuce Lady is Pamela Anderson, who 
appears in the lettuce bikini in PETA's newest ad, to promote vegetarianism. I 
wore the lettuce costume in Singapore, in PETA's first-ever demonstration in 
that country, and I wore it on a tour through Croatia. I also wore lettuce in 
South Africa, in Johannesburg at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
in 2002 and also in Cape Town. So, maybe, I have worn it 10 times. 
Lettuce Ladies hand out samples of delicious vegetarian food to show people 
that going vegetarian is not just good for the animals and good for your 
health, it's also good for your taste buds. Our mission is to encourage everyone to 
turn over a new leaf and go vegetarian. 
What about the Tiger Lady and Leopard Lady costumes? 
I didn't invent those costumes, either -- many others have preceded me! But I 
have stripped down to my leopard spots or tiger stripes to protest fur for 
PETA 50 times or so. 
Have you done Bay Area antifur actions? 
Yes. Last January, a friend and I painted ourselves like Leopard Ladies, and 
we skated around the Kristi Yamaguchi Ice Rink in Justin Herman Plaza in San 
Francisco. We carried a banner that said, "We'd Rather Bare Skin Than Wear 
Skin" until security kicked us out. 
We give our local activists printed materials that they can give to people 
who are wearing fur, like this. (She hands me three cards with various messages: 
"Fur Hurts!" "Whose Skin Are You In?" and "I Wear Fur; I'm an A**hole.") We 
want to create a situation where people are uncomfortable going outside in furs 
because they might be accosted, because they should be. 
San Francisco is not one of the furriest cities in the U.S.A. -- New York, 
Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C., are. But last year, it was 
noted in The Chronicle that opening night at the San Francisco Ballet, in early 
February, was a "furry" event. The symphony and the opera are also 
hoity-toity events where people who have furs might wear them, so I am thinking that 
this year, those places might be good places to show up with our little fox 
carcasses. I don't mind telling you this now, because we want people to know in 
advance that if they wear their fur there, they'll be confronted by people who 
are speaking up for the animals. 
Is there any connection between PETA activists and the Revolutionary Cells 
Animal Liberation Brigade, which recently bombed Chiron in Emeryville and 
Shaklee in Pleasanton? 
There's no connection between PETA and the Revolutionary Cells Animal 
Liberation Brigade, or with the Animal Liberation Front. We have no official stance 
on their activities, because they have nothing to do with us. We advocate going 
to any legal means to stop animal abuse, and we engage in civil disobedience, 
but PETA does not engage in violent activities. 
What about the recent foie gras incident, where the chef of Aqua Restaurant 
was threatened and his car, home and shop were vandalized because he's involved 
in foie gras production? Does PETA have a stance on that? 
That was also not a PETA activity, but PETA did do an undercover 
investigation at a New York foie gras farm. We saw an inflexible tube shoved down the 
throats of ducks and geese to force feed them a huge amount of grain. It was the 
equivalent of force feeding a human 20 pounds of spaghetti. They do this for 
several weeks. It causes a disease that makes the birds' liver enlarge. We got 
footage of punctured throats and esophagi, and the birds could no longer walk 
because they were so fat -- plus, they were injured because they had resisted 
the handling. Foie gras production is illegal in many countries -- it was just 
banned in Israel. 
Besides antifur demonstrations, what other activities is PETA involved in? 
We had a recent week of action against KFC, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5. We 
showed footage of their slaughterhouse, and we handed out leaflets at two KFCs in 
San Francisco's Mission District. KFC is the largest purchaser of chicken 
carcasses in the world, and we want them to tell their slaughterhouses to eliminate 
the worst abuses that happen there. PETA has been protesting fast-food 
corporations for a while. We started against McDonald's, and they agreed to our 
terms after several months of aggressive campaigning. Then we had successful 
campaigns against Burger King and Wendy's. 
We also have an antidairy campaign. We do billboards a lot, with slogans like 
"Milk Is for Babies." 
Oh. 
(We both stare at the Thai iced tea I'm drinking. It has milk in it.) 
We also have billboards that say, "Got Pus? Milk Does," based on studies 
reporting on the percentage of pus and other contaminants in a glass of milk. 
Oh. Ick. Huh. 
Humans are the only species that drinks another animal's milk. It's surreal 
that we do that. 
Lisa, does PETA have a huge antihunting campaign? 
We have an antihunting campaign, but it's not one of our biggest priorities. 
The small number of animals that are killed by hunters each year is extremely 
insignificant compared to the 40 billion animals raised and slaughtered 
annually for human consumption. Plus, animals killed by hunters had lives that were 
far better than those of domesticated animals that suffered in confinement on 
factory farms, deprived of any natural behavior. It's also very hypocritical 
for people to say hunting is immoral and then go to the supermarket and stock 
up on meat. Those people just don't want the blood on their own hands. 
You have done a lot of protest actions. How many? 
Between 50 and 100. It's my full-time job. I have traveled around the world 
doing different fur actions. Last summer, I was in Moscow for a while, 
protesting a fur convention there. I sat in a cage wearing a full-length fur cape, 
with a sign saying "Summer Is No Vacation for Animals on Fur Farms." I also went 
to Athens, Budapest, Prague. Last March, I went to Hong Kong and Tokyo. In the 
United States, I have been to New York, Chicago, Miami, San Diego, Los 
Angeles, Huntsville [Ala.], Dayton [Ohio], Augusta [Ga.], Detroit, Dallas, Houston, 
Austin -- all over. 
Have you ever been arrested? 
Yes, three times. My first arrest was at Saks Fifth Avenue in San Francisco 
three years ago. The designer Michael Kors was having a trunk show, showing off 
his new collection, and he uses a lot of fur. So, I went with a big bag of 
play money that was painted red to look bloody. I poured it on his head and I 
said, "Here's your bloody money, you fur pimp." I was arrested and charged with 
disruption of business, but the charges were dropped. I think technically I'm 
never supposed to go back to Saks ever again. 
My second arrest was in Las Vegas at a fur protest. I was dressed as the 
Leopard Lady, wearing just panties and pasties, and they took me to jail. Of all 
places -- it's bizarre to get arrested in Las Vegas for indecent exposure! 
The third arrest was last winter in Boston at a fur protest at Macy's. We 
were wearing fur coats with actual leghold traps dangling off of them. We covered 
ourselves in red paint, we writhed on the sidewalk, then we crawled over and 
painted the front door red. I was arrested and given a sentence of 30 hours of 
community service that I am completing with the SF/SPCA. 
Your job sounds fun. Do you enjoy planning your protest acts? 
Yes, it's very creative. We have weekly brainstorming meetings to express our 
ideas for demonstrations. This country was founded on acts of civil 
disobedience, and there's a proud history of it in many movements: women's rights, 
civil rights. 
Do bystanders get angry at you at your demonstrations? 
Oh, yes. Once in while, people get defensive: I've been called a few obscene 
names that you can't reprint in the paper. I even found a Web page that was 
titled "Lisa Franzetta Is a F**ing Moron." Anyone who is a public face for PETA 
gets flak like this from our adversaries. When people are profiting from 
animal abuse, it is not surprising that they will sink pretty low to try to defend 
themselves. 
Do your parents worry? Do they like the PETA activities that you do? 
My parents are animal lovers, and I think they are proud of me, but I'd be 
lying if I said they didn't wish it was someone else's daughter who ended up 
sitting in a Boston jail covered in red paint on a cold December morning. But 
they agree with me that ending animal abuse is valuable work.

In Seattle, a federal animal-research official suggests that the day might
come when experimentation on chimpanzees is ended. 
...
You are excused for thinking that Seattle was on the verge of another WTO
meltdown last week. Local media went out of their way to portray
animal-rights advocates as extremists who would use violence to disrupt a
conference of the American Association of Laboratory Animal Science
(AALAS) at the Washington Convention and Trade Center. Not only did
nothing happen, reporters missed a tectonic shift in the never-ending
conflict between researchers and activists over the use of animals in
biomedical research.

It's a debate that's always framed in absolutes. Researchers insist that
animal research is the crucial test bed for advancing human health.
Animal-rights advocates shout that such research is not applicable to
humankind and smacks of slavery, and worse. No wonder, then, that the
shouting on both sides of the argument stopped when a senior National
Institutes of Health official said that one day there might be a ban on
the use of chimpanzees in research in the U.S. 
...
THE BAN, if enacted, would be the first time the federal government
stopped the use of any species in biomedical research, according to
officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which regulates the use
of animals in research, and the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, which
regulates endangered species and research on wildlife. "This is definitely
a first, and it is significant in that respect," says Peter Singer, a
bioethicist at Princeton University and author of Animal Liberation, a
book credited by many as launching the modern animal-rights movement in
the U.S. "I think what it signals is that there are changes of the sort
that people in the animal-rights movement have been talking about for 30
years," Singer says. "It's not going to be an all or nothing thing. It's a
matter of making steady progress in changing peoples views."

Animal-rights advocates contacted by Seattle Weekly say they have never
heard such talk out of NIH?that the government would actually consider
banning the use of any animal in research.

Researchers were less willing to talk about the issue. Suzette Tardif,
associate director of the Southwest National Primate Research Center in
San Antonio, Texas, declined to comment on Strandberg's statement itself.
Her center uses chimpanzees in research. Asked what effect a ban would
have, Tardif said that chimps are the only species, aside from humans,
that contracts Hepatitis C, the leading reason for liver transplants in
the U.S.

For many, it is a highly emotional issue -- accusations that helpless
animals suffer in sterile laboratories at the hands of soulless
scientists. Animal rights organizations routinely provide shocking video
to television newsrooms to dramatize their cause.

But the FBI says an increasing number of animals rights groups are now
turning violent, alleging hundreds of destructive acts have taken place in
recent years in what critics call a misguided effort to stop animal abuse.

"I think people in the animal liberation movement are moving from
persuasion to coercion," said Oakland author Wesley Smith, who is
researching a book about the growing violence in the animal rights
movement. "The animal liberation movement has become anti-human."
...
While the FBI describes the ALF as a terrorist group, Craig Rosebraugh
claims the only damage caused by animal rights violence is property
damage. "They have a strict code of protecting human and non-human life,"
he said.

Rosebraugh says he does not participate in the violence, but receives
"communiqu?s" from the ALF, which he passes on to the news media.
...
And indeed, the animal rights movement says if its current tactics don't
work, its violence could escalate.

"I can't list what it could include. Whether it's assassination, bombings,
property destruction, I can't say," said Rosebraugh.

The Animal Liberation Front is reportedly an offshoot of the Earth
Liberation Front, which has claimed responsibility for violent acts
against organizations such as logging companies.

One of the quickest novelties to wear off is the novelty of dieting and 
weight control. So scientists and nutritionists are constantly seeking ways 
to bring back "that losing feeling."

Instead of eating hot dogs, how about running with one? As the media never 
tire of reminding us, 60% of American adults are overweight. But did you 
know that 60 million cats and dogs also suffer from the disease of obesity? 
For both people and pets, of course, added weight means increased risk of 
heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and a host of other ailments.


The idea for a unique pilot study called "People and Pets Exercising 
Together" (PPET) came not from the human side, but the pet side. "Hill's Pet 
Nutrition (maker of Science Diet and Pet Prescription pet foods) contacted 
me, as an obesity expert," Robert Kushner, MD, medical director of the 
Wellness Institute at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, tells 
WebMD. "They said we have two epidemics here, people and pets. Let's be 
creative."</docText>

  There's trouble on the other side of the chain-link
fences surrounding the state government's Foothills Wildlife Research
Facility. The dusty pastures are ground zero for a deer-killing plague
that is frighteningly similar to mad-cow disease.

It was here that the condition, known as chronic wasting disease, or CWD,
was first identified decades ago, and where animal-management practices
may have fueled an epidemic. Now, scientists are conducting research in
the pens and laboratories here in their search for ways to stop it.

They are racing against a disease that has rapidly spread across eight
states and parts of Canada. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called
CWD an "emergency." In Colorado, sharpshooters, some working from
helicopters, have slaughtered 10,000 deer in the past year trying to
contain its spread. Identified first only in captive animals, it has leapt
the fences, infecting a small but growing number of the nation's more than
20 million free-ranging deer.
...
Though the results came back negative, she'd already had the animal
butchered in the meantime. Since the local butchers tend to give customers
ground meat made from pooled scraps, often there's no guarantee a hunter's
kill won't be mixed with that of an animal that turned up positive for CWD.

"The processor takes scraps and turns it into hamburgers," says Jim
Widmier, the proprietor of Arrow Dynamics, a shop in Fort Collins that
caters to bow hunters. "That is a scary situation. The hamburger and
sausage you get is going to be ground up with other people's."

        <docText>Thousands of shahtoosh shawls and ivory items may be ready to 
tumble out of homes across the country, but the government?s amnesty scheme for 
such banned wildlife items seems to have left residents across the northern 
states largely unmoved and officials disappointed. 
The Union environment ministry, still collating countrywide data on its 
six-month amnesty scheme which ended mid-October, says ??a lot of people seem to 
be left out??. Ministry sources say the response from Punjab and Haryana is ??
not so good??. Some people, in fact, admit they never gave declaration a 
thought, though Punjab chief wildlife warden A S Dogra says a few hundred 
applications have come in and most people are becoming conscious of the need to be 
within the law. 
In each state, the numbers are being added up after the last-minute rush, 
which saw fence-sitters rushing to beat the deadline on legalising possessions 
banned for over two decades ? such as the shahtoosh shawl made from the fine fur 
of the highly-endangered Tibetan antelope, ivory or other wildlife items and 
even live animals. 
In UP, more than a thousand forms have come in, residents declaring shawls, 
leopard and tiger skins, ivory and according to a Lucknow report, elephants, 
black bucks and lions. Many, says Delhi-based conservationist Ashok Kumar, still 
do not seem to have declared their possessions for the fear that the 
inspectors will show up and harass them. </docText>

Cars stopped and passers-by stared as about 100 bikers filled Spon Street in 
Coventry city centre on their way to their fourth annual pet-food run.
The bikers, from all over the Midlands, gathered outside the Windmill Pub as 
a van was loaded with pet food, treats, and toys ready to be delivered to The 
Dogs Trust - formerly the National Canine Defence League, Honiley - and the 
RSPCA Centre, Coundon.
Family, friends and even some pets joined the bikers as they thundered out of 
the street at the start of their 35-mile round trip.
Mez Walpole, 37, social secretary of the Three Spires bike club, Coventry, 
which organised the run, said: "A lot of us have dogs and cats from rescue homes 
and doing this is our way of putting something back into the community.
"I've had my dog Tilly for four years now and I got her from the rescue 
centre in Coundon.
"There are two other bike clubs from Coventry here today, the Antelope and 
Griffin as well as people from all the Midlands.
"It's not just a way of us getting involved in the community, but also a 
chance for us all to get together.
"Everyone normally sees bikers as a bit scary, so it's also a chance for us 
to show that we are animal lovers with families and kids as well - we also do a 
Christmas toy run to Walsgrave hospital."
Three Spires club secretary Gary Cooke, 41, added: "It really is good fun. We 
round off the day with a party and really enjoy it."
Dogs Trust manager Sandra Wilson said: "It's absolutely brilliant what they 
do for us and all of things they bring are much appreciated.
"Most people think they are big, hard men, but this shows they really do care 
for the animals. A lot of them got their animals from here so they bring us 
in pictures to let us know how they are getting a long."

        <docText>Corky and Pumpkin, two black bears seized in a drug bust at the 
Canadian border, will leave the Sarvey Wildlife Center in Arlington on 
Wednesday for their new home. 
The bears will live at the Wild Animal Orphanage in Texas, a nonprofit 
sanctuary that cares for more than 600 wild animals. 
"When we walk back to the pens after they're gone, it will be like our best 
friends left. We'll miss them," Sarvey volunteer Jeff Guidry said. "Everybody 
loves these bears." 
U.S. Customs agents impounded the bears and sent them to Sarvey in January 
after agents discovered 166 pounds of marijuana, worth nearly $500,000, stashed 
in a hidden compartment in the bears' trailer. 
Duane Christopher Bradley of Abbotsford, B.C., pleaded guilty in July to 
conspiracy to distribute marijuana and is serving a 30-month prison sentence, 
according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
When the two bears arrived at Sarvey, they were so overweight they couldn't 
climb, their teeth and claws were broken, and they rarely ventured outside 
their den. 
The 7-year-old bears weighed between 300 and 400 pounds, instead of the 
normal 200 to 300 because they were being fed whole turkeys. 
The bears, who were fed a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, berries and 
breads at Sarvey, lost more than 100 pounds each, Guidry said. 
"Our biggest fear was that they would be sent back where they came from. We 
were very excited to hear that they were going to the best place we can send 
them," he said. 
The bears, who now have shiny coats and love to play, will have plenty of 
space at their home in Texas, Guidry said. 
Corky and Pumpkin, who were apparently raised by an animal dealer, are so 
used to humans that they couldn't be released into the wild. 
Sarvey ensured that the two bears would stay together, Guidry said. 
"They went through the abuse together and are bonded to each other," he said. 
"When something is happening to one, the other gets very upset and tries to 
defend. They're absolutely inseparable." 
Their departure leaves room at Sarvey for other bears, but the cage will need 
major repairs first, Guidry said. 
Corky and Pumpkin will be picked up Wednesday by the Wild Animal Orphanage's 
"humane train," a 30-foot trailer with transport cages. They'll then have a 
nonstop trip to Texas. 
Volunteers at Sarvey are making special bear treats for Corky and Pumpkin's 
trip. 
"It's a pretty emotional time. I'm glad they're going to a good place, but 
I'll miss them a lot," Guidry said.

AN IMPENDING shortage of vets with farm animal experience could leave the 
United Kingdom vulnerable in dealing with a future major disease outbreak.
MPs have warned that unless action is taken the Government could find it 
difficult to put in place a prevention plan as part of its proposed animal welfare 
strategy.
A report by the all-party House of Commons environment, food and rural 
affairs committee said it was hard to estimate the number of vets able to deal with 
large animals. but it was apparent that there is likely to be a shortage.
Committee chairman Michael Jack said any shortage of large animal vets would 
leave Britain vulnerable to further outbreaks of major animal diseases like 
foot-and-mouth.
"The announcement of Government strategies to improve veterinary surveillance 
and animal health and welfare is welcome," said Mr Jack. "But the Government 
must ensure that there are adequate numbers of vets to deliver results."
The warning follows similar concerns expressed at the annual congress of the 
Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons earlier this month that more veterinary 
practices are focusing on domestic pets as the number of livestock farms shrink 
at the same time as pet insurance schemes guaranteeing full payment of vet 
bills increase.
A survey for the RCVS this year revealed that only 960 of Britain's 3,000 
veterinary practices now do farm work. 
The survey also showed that the proportion of time devoted to treating cattle 
has fallen from 14% in 1998 to 7.5% in 2002 and the time spent treating sheep 
during the same period has fallen from 4% to 1.3%.
The MPs say this trend threatens the Government's ability to encourage 
veterinary surveillance for animal disease outbreaks and improve ani-mal health and 
welfare standards.
They say the Government should encourage student vets to join large animal 
practices. And ministers should be prepared to intervene in the market if 
necessary to ensure adequate pay for vets who deal with farm animals.
They also warn that the Competition Commission's report into 
prescription-only veterinary medicines might further reduce the numbers of large animal vets 
and call for the report to be reconsidered in that light.

At Darley Oaks farm in the Staffordshire village of Newchurch, Chris Hall has 
bred guinea pigs for use in animal experiments for more than 30 years. It may 
come as no surprise, then, that he has been targeted by local animal rights 
activists, who claim not only that the guinea pigs are housed in appalling 
conditions but who are also resolutely against the use of animals in research 
anyway. 
But what started as regular peaceful demonstrations outside the farm four 
years ago has escalated into violence and intimidation against the Hall family 
and many of their associates. Police said that that there has been a string of 
criminal activity - from vandalism to arson - in the name of a campaign that is 
rapidly becoming the new front line in the UK's animal rights movement. 
"The shift has moved from peaceful protest towards this more criminal way of 
protesting," says Inspector David Bird of the Staffordshire police force. Last 
week, one of the Halls' unused houses was the target of an arson attack 
believed by police to be the work of local activists. 
The Halls have never spoken publicly about the activists, and would not speak 
to the Guardian about the latest events. The campaign against them, however, 
has been recorded in detail on a web site run by Save the Newchurch Guinea 
Pigs (SNGP), which has protested outside the farm every week for the last four 
years. 
The site talks proudly about the group's past marches and protests and even 
publishes contact details for the Hall family, encouraging members of the 
public to call the farmer with their comments on his work. "At one point they [the 
Halls] complained that they were getting up to 400 phone calls a day from 
people who care about animals!" says the site.

Our cat Buffett just returned from a trip to the veterinarian's. He had a 
good time in the car looking out the window, with his leg on the arm rest, on the 
trip to the clinic. Buffett enjoys his car rides, no matter where they end 
up. This isn't true for most cats. 
How often does your cat ride in the car? Most cat car rides end at the 
veterinarian's, groomer's or kennel - not destinations most cats look forward to. 
This can cause your cat to dislike car rides, or even being in a carrier, 
because these experiences are associated with unpleasant outcomes. Your cat may 
disappear when she sees the carrier, or become a demon cat if you try to put her 
in the car. 
To overcome these problems, give your cat small doses of carriers and cars, 
paired with good things. Put the carrier in the family room with a few pieces 
of tuna or other irresistible treats inside. 
Don't be surprised if it takes your cat a while to decide it's safe to 
approach this dreaded object. After she's going inside on her own to retrieve the 
tuna, put a few more tidbits in and close the door for maybe 30 seconds. 
Repeat this process many times, gradually increasing how long you keep the 
door closed. But don't close your cat in the crate every time she goes in - try 
every third time. 
Once your cat will tolerate her carrier for 15 minutes or so, follow a 
similar procedure for the car. With treats, a favorite toy or catnip in the carrier, 
put her in the car, drive around the block and come home. 
You can ultimately extend this approach to taking her to the veterinary 
clinic, groomer's or kennel for nothing more than positive greeting experiences. 
These kinds of desensitization procedures work best if your cat doesn't have any 
bad experiences with the carrier or car during the process. 
Even better is to prevent problems by starting these procedures as soon as 
you acquire a new cat or kitten. Many problems - including fights between cats, 
destructive scratching and not using the litter box - can be prevented with 
the right approach.

A northwest Iowa farmer last week shot and killed a mountain lion, the first 
confirmed shooting of one of the animals in the state in more than a century. 
Russ Gradert of Ireton was doing field work Thursday when he saw the animal.
"We were finishing up combining the corn rows when we saw him go back into 
the corn rows," said Gradert, who was with his cousins Warren and Brian Gradert. 
"We finished up and went back out and shot it. This was the first time I saw 
a lion outside of a zoo."
The mountain lion, which was shot with a high-powered rifle, weighed about 
113 pounds and had a full set of teeth and claws.
Richard Bishop, wildlife bureau chief of the Iowa Department of Natural 
Resources, said officials have expected an increase in mountain lion sightings. 
"These animals are getting pushed out of their environments and are 
continuing to look for new habitats," he said.
According to Bishop, mountain lions once roamed Iowa but were pushed out of 
the state as it became more populated.
"We eliminated them, as well as several other animals, because we just 
couldn't handle them," Bishop said. "We just shot them. We basically persecuted 
them. At that time there were no game laws, and they were a potential threat to 
people."

Not everyone subscribes to the "Pets, don't leave home without'em" school of 
thought. Still, about 14 percent of Americans have traveled with a pet, 
according to the Travel Industry Association of America.
Man's best friend - the dog, not the remote control! - is the most common of 
animal voyagers. An American Automobile Association survey reports that 78 
percent of the people who travel with pets have taken Spot along.
Fifteen percent have toured with Fluffy, and 2 percent have brought along 
their birds. Three percent have traveled with a ferret, rabbit or fish.


Most of these trips were taken by car, though about 6 percent of pet-lovers 
have boarded a plane with pet in tow.
According to the Humane Society of the United States, only a few cruise lines 
accept pets, and usually just on ocean crossings.
Except for Seeing Eye dogs, beastie riders aren't accepted on most other 
modes of public transportation in this country. But check before you go.
. . .
Just because Rover is happy and healthy doesn't mean he longs for the open 
road. Leaving a pet at home - unless it has a problem with separation anxiety - 
can be the best option.
If you have an adventuresome pet that travels well - or if you are the one 
with separation anxiety - go ahead and hit the highway. Just don't toss Princess 
in the back and hope for the best, though. Preparation is a good thing.
"Pets who travel frequently usually do well," says Dr. James S. Cloman. "But 
there are always exceptions." Cloman works at Hanover Green Veterinary Clinic 
in Mechanicsville.
One way to prepare for a longer trip, he says, is to take your pet on shorter 
trips to fun places - not just to the kennel, to get groomed or get shots.
At www.petswelcome.com, packing a kit for the trip and also in case of 
emergency is suggested. Include items such as a supply of your pet's regular food, a 
blanket, a favorite toy or two, paper towels or newspapers, plastic bags (for 
scooping) and a container of fresh water (to avoid a sudden change in 
drinking water).
If you're traveling with a cat or dog, make sure you have your pet's ID, 
rabies tags and medical history. Clipping Rex's nails also can help prevent 
scratches and upholstery damage.
Cloman suggests transporting cats and dogs in carriers, if possible. "It's 
really a safety issue. You don't want something jumping around you when you're 
driving."
Once in the car, an overwrought pet may pant or salivate heavily. Cloman 
doesn't recommend sedatives for trips that last an hour or less because the 
tranquilizing effect lasts too long.
Whether to use a sedative is a matter of common sense, he says. "If they get 
very restless, get very vocal, try to escape from the carrier . . . you might 
want to try it."
Always check with your vet before administering calming medications, Cloman 
warns. The dosage is extremely important, especially with very young or older 
animals.
"Another sign of nervousness," he says, "is coming out at either end." One 
way to avoid carsickness or diarrhea is to feed your pet the night before if 
you're leaving in the morning, or offer a light meal in the morning if you plan 
to depart later in the day.
It's generally a good idea not to feed your pet while you're in transit, 
though it should have access to water either in the car or at rest stops.
If your pet is on medication, call your vet before you go. Some drugs, 
particularly antibiotics, can upset pets' stomachs when they travel. Cloman says 
it's usually best not to administer drugs right before you leave.
When it comes to the restroom routine, he says, "Most people know their pets' 
habits. Sometimes the pet has to go more frequently on trips because he's 
nervous or excited. Let dogs get out where they can be comfortable and walk 
around."
And always make sure Rover's on a leash before you open the car door. "If 
they've really got to go, they will. Give them the opportunity. If they take it, 
great. If not, you've done all you can do."
Unless it's a 12-hour trip, Cloman says, most cats are really good about 
keeping their own counsel, as it were.
Some carriers are big enough to accommodate a small litter box, he says. But 
most cats usually wait to go till you get where you're going.
Some cats, Cloman adds with a laugh, won't do anything the whole trip except 
grumble.
Letting your dog hang out the window while driving isn't necessarily a good 
idea. "I have clients whose dogs never jumped out, but suddenly did, or had 
corneal injuries from rocks."
When it comes to carrying more than one cat, Cloman says, there's no set 
standard. Some do well two to a carrier; some need space. Sometimes, even if 
they're in separate carriers, it's better if they can see each other.
The best thing to do if you want to transport your pet via jet, he says, is 
to call the airline. Often, you'll need a health certificate, sometimes a 
number of days in advance. If you're leaving the country, check on quarantine and 
pet policies, as well as any necessary vaccinations.
"It's a big, loud trip," Cloman points out. Though most airlines now allow 
pets as carry-on baggage - if carriers will fit under your seat - some pets 
still must fly in separate compartments.
"They can be more stressed if their owners aren't with them. You can give 
them a sedative, but there's no one monitoring them, and that's not good," Cloman 
says. "It's a bit of a compromise . . . but nothing I would let stand in the 
way of doing it [if you must fly]."
However your pet travels, Cloman says, there's not much you can do if it is 
extremely vocal. Sometimes a good, calming touch will help.
But, he acknowledges, "I have a low tolerance for noise like that myself." 
Fortunately, his dogs mostly snore when they travel.
. . .
Small animals are a, er, horse of a different color, says Dr. Larry Winters. 
Winters, who built Hanover Green Veterinary Clinic in 1997, has worked with 
wildlife as well as "these other little creatures that have become popular [as 
pets]."
Winters usually recommends a travel carrier for smaller animals.
"We don't typically sedate them," he says. "They don't usually need it. 
Rabbits and ferrets aren't quite like a dog or cat that gets nervous or upset when 
you change their routine. They don't seem to be as stressed."
Of course, it can be hard to tell. "Most of these animals don't vomit," 
Winters says. "They just don't have the type of muscle in the esophagus that allows 
them to regurgitate."
Be sure not to use too large a carrier. If you're transporting a guinea pig, 
hamster or mouse, for instance, too big a carrier allows the animal to bounce 
around, which can cause injury.
Winters recommends lining the cage or carrier with a lot of bedding material. 
Unless it's a really long trip, don't leave food or water with your pet. 
"They tend to burrow or bury food, then just eliminate in that and [the bedding] 
absorbs the odor."
On long trips, a small water bottle will do the trick.
Winters also suggests smaller cages for birds on the go. Bigger birds do well 
in carriers made for cats or small dogs.
His primary advice for bird-lovers is to watch the car temperature. Too much 
air conditioning or wind from the windows, for example, tends to aggravate 
their respiratory systems.
Snakes, Winters says, usually do best in pillowcases (just don't forget to 
secure the open end!). They can breathe through the fabric. Plus, he says, they 
like the confinement, it keeps their body temperature normal, and they won't 
be bouncing off the walls.
The same goes for fish. Bag'em. "Plastic bags are the best containers," says 
Winters, "because they minimize trauma to the body of the fish."
Tie the bag so the water doesn't spill, then put it in a box or big can to 
keep it upright.
"Fish travel pretty well that way," he says. Just remember to open the bag 
every hour or two and let in some air.
Winters is a fan of containment in general. "Cats not confined can really 
freak out," he says, recalling one client who was traveling with her cat and dog 
when the cat jumped in the driver's face.
"She rolled her car; the cat disappeared; the dog broke his leg; the woman 
was injured. I give people carriers now"

Jordan Klein wants to know why New Castle police shot and killed his dog.
Jordan?s mom, Tammy Klein, doesn?t think her son?s dog deserved to die, even 
if the dog was running at large. She also wonders how her children will get 
over their newfound hatred of police.
New Castle Police Sgt. Edward Wilks says it?s ?disturbing? the dog had to be 
shot. Had the dog worn a license or current vaccination tag, she would still 
be alive today, Wilks said.
According to police reports, New Castle police picked up the dog, Jenny, on 
Oct. 15. Later that day, police shot and killed Jenny on Silt Mesa, after the S
ilt police would not admit her into their pound.
?The dog had become aggressive,? Wilks said. ?And the Silt pound doesn?t 
take vicious dogs. Garfield County doesn?t accept vicious dogs. Vets won?t take 
vicious dogs. We didn?t have any place to store it.?
Klein disputes the vicious dog allegation. ?There?s no way Jenny acted the 
way they say she did,? Klein said.
In a letter to the editor, 10-year-old Jordan wrote, ?They said my dog was 
very mean and tryed to bite them. Why did the police shoot my dog??

        <docText>If all the cats and dogs in Jefferson County only knew 
what kind of party is about to be thrown for them. 
This coming Sunday, more than 400 items ranging from Tiffany glass to a 
dinner for four with television political commentator Jack Germond will be 
auctioned Sunday at the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center in Shepherdstown. 
The auction, which organizers hope will raise more than $30,000, will be used 
to help pay for operating the Jefferson County Animal Welfare Society and 
Spay Today, an organization that helps people spay and neuter pets at a reduced 
cost, organizers said. 
The Jefferson County Animal Welfare Society, an animal shelter along Leetown 
Road, has been struggling with finances and accommodating large numbers of 
unwanted pets.

  Two black bears that were seized in a marijuana arrest at 
the Canadian border are bound for a wildlife sanctuary in Texas. 
Corky and Pumpkin are set to leave the Sarvey Wildlife Center on Wednesday to 
join more than 600 creatures at the nonprofit Wild Animal Orphanage in San 
Antonio, officials at Sarvey said. 
"When we walk back to the pens after they're gone, it will be like our best 
friends left. We'll miss them," Sarvey volunteer Jeff Guidry said. "Everybody 
loves these bears." 
The 7-year-old sows were sent to the wildlife center near this Snohomish 
County town after U.S. Customs agents found 166 pounds of marijuana worth nearly 
$500,000 in a trailer carrying the bears at the border crossing in Blaine on 
Jan. 27. 
Duane Christopher Bradley of Abbotsford, British Columbia, pleaded guilty in 
July to conspiracy to distribute marijuana and was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in 
prison. 
He initially told investigators he was taking the bears to Hollywood for a 
movie, than said he was taking the pot to Los Angeles to exchange for cash and 
cocaine to take back to Canada, according to documents filed in U.S. District 
Court.

Cougars chewing at economy

Cougars have killed so many Rocky Mountain elk in Wallowa County 
that only 360 tags for antlerless elk are being offered to hunters this 
year, down from 4,140 just eight years ago.

Because hunting is big business in northeast Oregon, the economic impact 
quickly trickles down to the county's 7,140 residents. The sharp decline 
also could signal bad news for people beyond Wallowa County.

State Fish and Wildlife Department biologists say heavy cougar predation of 
elk calves will continue and is likely to have a similar effect in Union, 
Baker, Umatilla and Grant counties.

During elk season, hunters used to overwhelm the cafes, gas stations and 
grocery stores of Wallowa County, said 73-year-old Ken Spidell of Lostine. 
People joked that a traffic signal had to change in Portland before you 
could make a left turn in Enterprise.

"Now you can't tell hunting season is here," said Rob Lamb, 55, a Joseph 
businessman and flyfishing outfitter who has lived in the county 25 years.

The county's 19 outfitter and guide operations have been especially hard 
hit.

A decade ago, 30 to 40 clients of the Eagle Cap Wilderness Pack Station at 
Wallowa Lake paid $1,000 each for a deluxe, five-day December antlerless elk 
hunt

Ernest Hemingway will be turning in his grave: Barcelona is planning to 
deliver the coup de grace to bullfighting. 
The author had a lifelong love affair with bullfighting and wrote evocatively 
of its "spiritual intensity." 
But public opinion in Spain's second city has swung against the ancient 
sport, and talk of a ban is rife in the corridors of the city council and the 
parliament of Catalonia, the region that includes Barcelona. 
One senior member of Barcelona's ruling Catalan Nationalist Party said it was 
"only a matter of time" before an official ban was proposed and that 
bullfighting could disappear from the city "within a few years." 
Opponents of bullfighting argue that the slaughter of more than 100 bulls a 
year for public entertainment is anachronistic and incompatible with 
Barcelona's ambition to become one of the world's leading cities for arts and culture. 
Animal welfare campaigners want bullfighting banned by the end of this year 
because they say it will taint the 2004 Universal Forum of Culture, a festival 
that Barcelona is hosting. 
Bullfighting has already been halted in several Catalonian towns, and in June 
the regional parliament became the first in Spain to ban children under 14 
from attending corridas de toro. 
Opponents of bullfighting are protesting not only because of the "cruelty" of 
the sport but also as part of their campaign for independence from Madrid, 
the Spanish capital, where the corrida remains highly popular. 
One anti-bullfighting Bar-celona politician said, "We are forging our own, 
distinctly Catalan identity based not on the outdated public slaughter of 
animals but on the arts, music and architecture." 
Talk of a ban is a red flag to bullfighting supporters. The Catalan 
Bullfighting Federation attacked the campaigners as "ill-informed." 
"Bullfighting is an art form and a vital part of our history and culture and 
gives jobs to thousands of people," said German Jimenez, the federation's 
spokesman. A ban would mean caving in to "ignorant" and excessively delicate 
modern sensibilities about animal welfare, he said. 
Jimenez warned that the prospect of a ban could bring thousands of 
bullfighting supporters on to the streets in protest. 
Aficionados endorse the views of Hemingway, who saw bullfighting as a ballet 
led by a proud, elegant matador. In Death in the Afternoon, he writes of "the 
emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced 
by a man, an animal and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick." 
Barcelona has only one of its three original bullrings left -- La Monumental 
-- and there are only four in all of Catalonia.

1) Current Concepts - Chronic Constipation in the October 2, 2003 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine places no emphasis on a low-fiber diet nor says anything about dairy products as the cause of constipation. As far as dietary treatment is concerned, the article contains a single sentence suggesting an increase in fruits and vegetables.  This nine page article dedicates two pages to drug therapy and the rest to verbiage irrelevant to your practicing doctor's care for his patients.  When something as obvious as the connection between the food that enters your body and the "digested food" that leaves your body is neglected by one of the world's most respected medical journals, you can understand why your doctors rarely mention diet in connection with your problems, but prescribe bags full of drugs, and as a result, almost never solve your health problems.  For more information on curing constipation see my September 2002 Newsletter article - In Search of the Perfect Bowel Movement.

2) Lifetime Risk for Diabetes Mellitus in the United States in the October 8, 2003 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association reports that for individuals born in the year 2000, 33% of males and 39% of females will develop diabetes.  The risk for minorities is even higher with an estimate of half of Hispanic females developing diabetes.  Most of these diabetics will go on to have kidney and/or heart disease.  Who is going to pay for all of this?  Disease from unhealthy eating is the greatest threat facing the future of developed countries.  The solution is simple:  type 2 diabetes is due to rich food, lack of exercise, and the resulting obesity - change the obvious.

A number of letters to the editor arrived this week 
regarding  Global Ways tropical fish shipments, including these:
...
I can imagine that I could import tropical fish without risks of DOA, but
not using Global Ways shippers. My last shipment had over 80% fatalities
and I'm still awaiting satisfaction from this group...
...
I urge your readers to *not* use Global Ways ... low survival rates, 
poor packaging, poor responsiveness. I can't imagine how they stay
in business. We will never use them again.
...
...the packaging on my last shipment of Tigrinus Catfish was abominable.
Shipping bags were covered in some noxious substance that caused our 
handlers hands to go numb and eventually need emergency medical treatment. 
You can imagine the condition of the fish themselves. Less than 10% 
survived their trip. We are proceeding with legal action against Global. 
...
In response to these comments, Global Ways spokeman blamed an inexperienced
packer in South America for problems in a very few shipments. "We are working
with these customers and have guaranteed them satisfaction. A problem occurred
in a very small number of the 5000 shipments we handled last quarter. We regret any 
inconveniences and remain dedicated to providing the highest quality service."

        <docText>In reaction to the shooting death of a beloved family pet last 
month, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has donated educational 
material to the town's elementary schools to help teach students to treat all 
life with respect. 
In an Oct. 10 letter to the Moosup and Shepard Hill elementary schools, 
Sangeeta Kumar, PETA humane educator, wrote that the organization donated the 
information after reading about the death of Mr. Bojangles, a basset hound owned by 
the Carpenter family on Ashley Street. 
?For more than 100 years, the humane-education community has sought to 
prevent violence and improve society by teaching compassion and empathy for all life,
? Kumar wrote. 
William Buchert, 44, of 1 Ashley St. was charged with cruelty to animals, 
unlawful discharge of a firearm and breach of peace for shooting and killing ?Bo?
 with a high-powered pellet gun, according to police. He will reappear in 
Superior Court in Danielson Nov. 26. 
Shepard Hill Principal Melanie Robeda and Moosup Principal Susan Chamie said 
they received the materials and, after carefully reviewing the information, 
distributed the packet that included a video and other educational materials. 
Teachers were instructed to use the information at their discretion. 
Robeda said since the beginning of school students have been discussing the 
different characteristics of a good citizen and that the ?Share the World? 
materials fit in with that curriculum. 
Chamie added that some of the second-grade teachers were able to incorporate 
the information into their classrooms and that so far the information has been 
well received. 
The kit also includes brochures to give parents tips on incorporating 
kindness into daily life and identifying potentially aggressive behavior at an early 
age. 
?The perpetrator of the vicious attack on the dog obviously was never taught 
these vital lessons as a child,? Kumar wrote.

        <docText>A growing militant movement opposed to genetic engineering in 
agriculture and medicine is turning to violent and criminal sabotage - from 
the bombing of a Bay Area biotech company to the destruction of genetically 
modified crops. 
As a result, targeted companies aren't just taking extra security precautions 
but also altering business strategies. 
The violence, which the FBI says suddenly became more serious this year, 
stems in part from frustration that peaceful protests have failed to slow the pace 
of biotech's progress. 
"We've seen a drastic escalation in the use of violent tactics in the past 
year," said Phil Celestini, head of the FBI's domestic terrorism unit in 
Washington. 
A range of militant environmental, economic and animal-rights activist groups 
have used the Internet to organize around biotechnology, first in Europe and 
now in the United States. Many fear the technology will forever harm nature 
while others object to how animals are treated in drug experiments. 
A 25-year-old Californian, Daniel Andreas of San Diego, is wanted by the FBI 
in connection with some of the most recent attacks: the bombings in August of 
the biotech company Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., and last month of a 
nearby cosmetics manufacturer. Aside from a few shattered windows, little damage 
was done to either company. 
The group that claimed responsibility for the blasts, the previously unheard 
of Revolutionary Cells, vowed more bombings were to come. 
Authorities consider the bombings to mark a new chapter in anti-biotech 
militancy in 2003 that included the vandalism of a Chiron executive's car and the 
trashing of a biology lab at Louisiana State University last month. 
In France, an estimated half of the 100 plots of experimental biotech crops 
were destroyed this year, prompting some 1,500 scientists, including two Nobel 
laureates, to demand an end to the vandalism. 
Almost since James Watson and Francis Crick discovered DNA 50 years ago, 
scientists have been exploring ways to manipulate and exploit those building 
blocks of life for everything from boosting crop yields to germ warfare. 
But questions didn't arise about biotechnology's safety and impact on nature 
until San Francisco area scientists Herb Boyer and Stanley Cohen succeeded 30 
years ago in splicing genes from one species into another. Since then, 
opposition to biotechnology research, first in agriculture and later in medicine, has 
grown, especially in Europe.

Susan I. Jando, 64, has sheltered derelict felines at her home for 19 years. 
It began with just a few and then ... word spread. 
"I get them from all around," Jando said. "Everybody calls me. Nobody ever 
shows up with anything but cats." 
People bring cats from Midland, Saginaw and Flint. After a disease outbreak 
at the Humane Society of Tuscola County even that agency looked to unload extra 
cats on Jando. 
She has partnered with others to help rescue cats, calling her group the 
"Cass River Pet Friendz." 
She shelters 32 cats at her home. She had about 50 several months ago. 
Tuscola County no longer offers animal control facilities. A budget shortfall 
forced the elimination of the department and voters rejected a tax increase 
to finance the project. Animal control has not operated since 2002. Voters will 
again confront the issue Tuesday when they vote on a reallocation of 
millages. 
Mark A. Wachner of the Saginaw County Animal Care Center says that private 
animal rescue operations are helpful, but he advises rescuers to proceed with 
caution. 
"Good rescues are a real benefit," he said, "but it can get overwhelming. 
Animals are not designed to live in a cage."

On most evenings this fall, when Bonnie McElrath and her 8-year-old 
daughter, Kylie, fed their horses boarded in a Coker Butte pasture, they 
were visited by 50 of the biggest and most majestic creatures Oregon&#x2019;s woods 
have to offer.

McElrath&#x2019;s horses shared the pasture with a herd of Roosevelt elk that has 
graced rural ranches and pear orchards along Medford city limits for the 
past 20 years.

Protected and coddled by landowners between Highway 62 and Foothill Road, 
the normally wary elk paid little mind to the McElraths as they sat 
spellbound, soaking in the elk&#x2019;s grunts and smells, something most 
Oregonians never experience.

"We&#x2019;d sit there and it was just incredible how the elk would mill round us, 
and there&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;d do anything to bother them," McElrath says. "There&#x2019;s 
an unwritten rule among everyone here that you leave that herd alone."

But there are no written rules that the herd is off-limits to sport hunting. 
And when two of the elk, including a large six-point bull that was their 
leader, were shot legally by two hunters during the recent elk season, the 
incident incensed people such as McElrath who view those elk more like 
neighbors than wild animals.

"That herd, basically, belongs to everyone in this valley," McElrath says. 
"I think it&#x2019;s disgusting. I can&#x2019;t even tell my daughter what happened. It 
would devastate her."

As cities continue to creep toward Oregon&#x2019;s wildlands, big-game hunting 
within the shadows of urban areas is becoming a hot issue along both ends of 
Interstate 5.

Shooting guns within city limits is illegal in Oregon, but cases like 
Medford&#x2019;s elk and a similar incident involving a black-tailed deer near 
Portland have created a call for extending the no-hunting zones out to 
cities&#x2019; urban growth boundaries.

Terror comes in many forms. It can be a plane into an
office building or a bomb on a boat driven into an aircraft carrier. Now,
right here in Southern California, a new kind of terrorism has surfaced.
It is just as violent, and just as deadly and is for the most unlikely of
reasons: to protect the environment.

The ELF, or Earth Liberation Front, has been blamed for causing
devastation and terror.
...
"The Earth Liberation Front believes that there has been enough time for
talk, now is the time for action," said Rod Coronado, unofficial ELF
spokesman.
...
But as TEAM 4 Reports has uncovered, that line may be blurring. While many
are familiar with PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, as a
popular cause among animal loving celebrities, it has a financial
connection to Rod Coronado.

"Previous to my going to prison, PETA provided legal defense. They paid
for my lawyers," said Coronado.

"While they've done some laudable work with regard to animal rights,
they've been increasingly linked to Mr. Coronado," said Levin.
...
"We don't support ELF. We support anybody and everybody who speaks out on
behalf of animals in a legal and constitutional way," said Jeff Kerr,
general counsel for PETA.

"Torching a $50 million apartment complex is the only way that we're going
to get the industry to be accountable for the destruction that they are
responsible for," said Coronado.

The Jezer house in Tully has an equal opportunity kitchen.

Rhea Jezer, two-time Democratic candidate for Congress and environmental
advisor to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, does most of the day-to-day
cooking for the family, which includes three grown children and five
grandchildren.
...
"Rabbi Danny Jezer is one hell of a vegetarian cook," says family friend
Donald Siegel, a professor of earth sciences at Syracuse University. "I
had dinner at his house for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, as I do every
year, and the food was terrific."
...
"A higher form of being kosher is vegetarianism."

An even higher form might be becoming a vegan, a vegetarian who eats no
animal products. Jezer isn't ready to call himself either.

"I do not claim to be a vegetarian because I do eat fish," he says. And he
enjoys milk, cheese and other dairy products.

"I have no problems eating dairy. It's not killing an animal. I'm not a
vegan." 
...
"She does a superb job," says her husband. If you know a cook who really
stands out or would like to nominate yourself, write to: "Cook of the
Week," CNY, The Post-Standard, P.O. Box 4915, Syracuse, NY 13221. Please

It might not get the publicity of the presidential primary or clog the
highways like leaf-peeping season, but Wednesday is one of the big days on
New Hampshire?s public-events calendar: the start of regular deer-hunting
season.

Nobody knows how many people will carry their rifles into New Hampshire?s
woods Wednesday, but the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service estimates there are
some 60,000 deer hunters in the state.
...
Last year, archers took 1,854 deer while muzzleloader hunters took 2,911,
almost half the 6,064 tally of regular firearm hunters.

Further, hunting is stagnant overall, partly because of growing
alternatives for recreation.

?In today?s world there are so many activities available to people that
hunting is competing with a lot of other things for people?s time,
attention and money,? Gustafson said. ?But certainly the interest and
passion is there, without a doubt.?
...
Finally, another question mark has been added to deer hunters? concerns:
chronic wasting disease.

This disease, similar to mad cow disease, has struck white-tailed deer in
the upper Midwest.

Chronic wasting disease has not been known to spread to humans, or any
animal but deer and elk, and has never been seen on the East Coast. Still,
officials are being cautious: New Hampshire officials banned the import of
deer and elk last year and will examine killed deer?s brains and spinal
tissue to make sure it has not arrived.

The state is not making any special recommendations to hunters as a result
of chronic wasting disease, but it is emphasizing suggestions that have
been made for years, such as wearing rubber gloves while cleaning the carcass.

An overpowering stench greets visitors entering a cavernous Central Valley
shed, far from the fancy restaurants where foie gras is served as a prized
delicacy.

Inside, dim light illuminates wooden pens where 2,000 ducks are force-fed
cornmeal mush twice daily to fatten them for slaughter.

This is the home of Sonoma Foie Gras, one of only two farms in the United
States specializing in the duck liver delicacy. And it is ground zero for
animal rights activists who have made clandestine raids to "rescue" ducks
and videotape the force-feeding operations.

Guillermo Gonzalez, a 51-year-old Salvadoran-born immigrant, founded
Sonoma Foie Gras in 1986 and moved it to a set of barns near Stockton five
years ago. He opened the door to his operation, insisting that the farming
techniques he has honed over two decades are humane and meet health rules
for growing animals for food, and that he is the victim of "terrorism."

But activists, led by a 25-year-old vegan with a history of "direct
action" against companies that traffic in animal products, say Sonoma Foie
Gras is a torture factory for ducks.

        <docText>No matter what diet you are on, if you eat
less and lose weight you also lower your risk of heart disease, doctors
told a conference on Sunday.
...
"The type of person who is going to go for a low-fat, vegetarian diet is
not, in my experience, the kind of person who is going to go for a
high-meat diet," Dansinger said.

But for people with high cholesterol levels, the Ornish diet might be the
most beneficial, Dansinger said.

"The Ornish diet, low-fat vegetarian, was best for lowering the bad LDL
cholesterol, while other diets were better at raising the good HDL
cholesterol," Dansinger said. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol is the
stuff that clogs arteries, while high density lipoprotein carries fat out
of the blood.

The Ornish diet cut LDL by 10 percent and Atkins lowered it 2 percent to 3
percent, Dansinger said.

Ornish said doctors often place too high a value on high HDL levels. "If
you reduce fat, there is less garbage, less saturated fat and cholesterol,
so your body needs less garbage trucks," he said.

But Dansinger said his study was one of several that has suggested the
high-fat Atkins diet, in the short-term, does not raise the risk of heart
disease.

        <docText>Whether it&#x2019;s family pets left behind in a flood or livestock hit with a 
disease, adverse impacts on animals during disasters affects the quality of 
life for humans. That&#x2019;s the message articulated by veterinarian and 
internationally known animal health consultant Sebastian Heath during a 
recent presentation at the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture on 
the consequences of disasters on animal and human health.

According to Heath, who authored the book "Animal Management in Disasters," 
the fate of livestock during disasters or infectious disease outbreaks also 
has implications for human health and welfare. An example is foot and mouth 
disease. "It really wasn&#x2019;t until the (2001) outbreak of foot and mouth 
disease in the United Kingdom that the federal government really started 
paying attention to animals and disasters, and really started thinking about 
the tremendous consequences that livestock could have on communities in 
general," Heath says.

He states impacts of an animal infectious disease such as foot and mouth are 
not just on animal health, but on social and financial systems as well. An 
example is the strong connection between livestock and feed grains. "For 
every 100,000 cattle we would kill or would go off feed because of foot and 
mouth disease, the global corn supply would increase by 8%. That means that 
for every 100,000 animals that would go off feed here in the U.S., the 
global corn price would come down. That could have serious implications for 
developing countries and other corn and soybean producing countries," Heath 
adds.

Heath explains we should develop serious and meaningful farm-based security 
programs to prevent the spread of animal infectious diseases. He also notes 
we, as a society, need to start looking at animal disease control within the 
broader context of hazard preparedness generally, and establish a continuum 
of preparedness for all kinds of disasters.

They landed dramatically in the limelight recently after winning -- then 
losing -- a surprising contract in Washington, D.C., but the Humane Society of 
Canada and its CEO have for years found themselves the focus of controversy, 
criticism and legal conflict.
The society's deal to run Washington's animal shelter was cancelled last 
month after a local outcry against the agreement.
Such tension, though it has rarely surfaced publicly, has marked the 
organization's history almost since its birth a decade ago. Founded by the Humane 
Society of the United States in 1993, the Canadian society broke free three years 
later in what one judge referred to as a "purported coup d'?tat" by Michael 
O'Sullivan, the chief executive. The Americans responded with "egregious" 
behaviour themselves, the judge noted.
More recently, some Canadian animal-welfare organizations have said the 
Humane Society of Canada's fundraising efforts -- aided by its highly recognizable 
name -- have diverted funds away from practical projects elsewhere, while the 
Society refuses to lay out exactly where its donations are spent. These 
critics say that the Society has no formal connections with most other humane 
societies in the country and that, while its Revenue Canada filings indicate it 
works solely in Canada, it seems to do much of its work overseas.
"The name [Humane Society of Canada] would lead the public to believe that he 
represents humane societies and that he is the national body, speaking on 
behalf of animal welfare, and yet he's not," complained Bob Van Tongerloo of the 
Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, an umbrella group.
"It's our organization that works with science, with research, with the 
livestock industry, with the federal government, and he's taking in funds that we 
cannot tell are being spent appropriately."

When U.S. Marine Corps reservist Ravi Chand found out that he was going to go 
to war, his first reaction was confusion. 
A class of ?02 graduate of UC Santa Cruz, Chand, 23, had just moved to 
Virginia to pursue his career: campaigning for the animal rights group People for 
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. That was put on hold with the 
American invasion of Iraq. 
"Here I am," Chand recalled thinking during a recent phone interview, "living 
the philosophy of nonviolence and then getting called to go to war?" 
But the vegan serviceman quickly found a way to reconcile his beliefs with 
his military action. 


A Sacramento native, Chand joined the corps at 18, right after high school. 
The challenge of going through boot camp that summer, he said, was just as 
exciting as the prospect of getting financial support in college. 
And while, he said, his young political views were unusual for a Marine, he 
enjoyed the chance to weigh his opinions against those of his peers. 
A defining moment in his thinking came during his junior year of college at 
UCSC. 
Sitting in the Cowell College dining hall one day, he was confronted by 
another student: "She started yelling at me because I was eating meat," he said. 
Chand was so disturbed that he felt he needed to know more. 
"I went and read ?Diet for a New America? to have argumentative comebacks," 
he said, referring to John Robbins? vegetarian anthem. 
Instead, the book turned him into a vegetarian. 
His senior year, a PETA documentary prompted him to go vegan and then to go 
out and spread the merits of his new diet. Watching the video made him think 
that "animals have the same range of emotions as humans." 
Soon, Chand was leading workshops sponsored by an animal rights student 
group. Kerry Holliday, then head of the group, said Chand?s disposition helped him 
carry his message to a mainstream audience. 
"He shattered that stereotype of the hippie vegan," Holliday said. 
After graduation, Chand moved to Norfolk, Va., to work full-time at PETA?s 
headquarters. 
Then came the war, and Chand served as a corporal on the crew of an Amtrack 
amphibious tank. His unit came under direct fire when it was ambushed in the 
southern Iraqi city of Nasiriyah, he said. 
His philosophy, he said, helped him put the horrors of war into perspective. 
After all, no act of mayhem could be worse than what goes on in 
slaughterhouses, or so he thought. He goes as far as claiming that killing animals is as 
immoral as killing people. 
Overthrowing the regime of ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, he said, was a 
good cause for going to war. At the same time, it gave him a chance to tell 
people about what is, in his view, the most important cause of all ? not eating 
animals. 
Chand said six Marines went vegetarian and one went vegan.

Jack Bradley, 6, proudly showed off the pinch marks on his arm he got 
collecting crabs for the classroom tank he and classmates at Midland Elementary 
School were exploring last week. 
The Rye second-grade students were learning about marine life by observing 
and handling specimens they collected at the Edith Read Sanctuary and by reading 
about sea creatures at the school library and on the Internet. When the 
students are finished with their observations, the fish and crabs will be returned 
to the sanctuary. 
"Next summer, when I go to the beach with my dad, I'll know how to look for 
hermit crabs, green crabs and minnows," Jack said.

Shooting wolves from airplanes as a form of predator control could resume 
early next year if the Alaska Board of Game takes advantage of a new state law at 
its meeting in Anchorage this week. 
It would be the first aerial wolf control in nearly 20 years and is certain 
to stir emotions in Alaska and beyond. Wolf-protection advocates plan a 
demonstration airing their point of view at the Game Board at 10:30 a.m. today at the 
Millennium Alaskan Hotel, where the board is meeting. Organizers say they 
will bring "wolf look-alikes" dressed in bulletproof vests. 
National protests, including a tourism boycott, are also possible, said 
Dorothy Keeler, a wildlife photographer and longtime vocal opponent of wolf 
control. A boycott in the early 1990s helped persuade former Gov. Wally Hickel to 
call off the last planned lethal wolf-control program. 
But even as protesters speak out, Game Board members say they believe other 
Alaskans, particularly hunters and rural residents, are ready for lethal wolf 
control, which is aimed at boosting populations of game animals, to resume. 
The board could approve a long-awaited predator control program in a small 
area around McGrath. Also at the meeting, the board will consider similar 
measures for the Skwentna region and could lay the groundwork for programs elsewhere 
around the state.

This Thanksgiving, will you serve turkey or tofurkey? A few years ago, you 
might not even have thought twice. But vegetarianism is on the rise and any 
number of thoughtful articles on animal cruelty, vegetarianism, and factory 
farming are making even dedicated meat-eaters think again about where and how their 
food is raised. To avoid fouling up your choice, whether bird, or un-bird, 
consider these tips and advice: 

* Organic may not be enough. Organic is increasingly big business, and many 
large organic farms resemble industrial farms in significant ways, 
manufacturing standardized product, in large quantities, built to ship over long 
distances. 
* Local can be better than organic. Many small farms are essentially organic, 
but don't always get certified and so therefore can't label themselves as 
such. Many also prize artisanal values over labels. Buying locally from such a 
farm, or from a greenmarket or specialty food store you trust, is often the best 
choice: It supports a small-scale agriculture, encourages biodiversity over 
standardization, and cuts down on the fossil fuels used in shipping across the 
country. 
* Cruelty-free is key. The world is rife with reports like PETA's on a 
Minnesota turkey farm: the farm manager was caught on tape bludgeoning birds with a 
stick and pliers and wringing their necks. More often, but hardly less 
cruelly, turkeys are kept in horribly cramped conditions: 10,000 birds in a 
windowless shed with less than three square feet per bird, the air filled with ammonia 
and responsible for many respiratory diseases, the waste-filled ground leading 
to foot ulcerations, the birds debeaked so they don't peck one another to 
death. Labels like "free range" and "free roaming," minimally verified by the 
USDA, assure little besides some access to open air. Birds are scientifically 
bred for breast meat; this practice has grown so advanced that such turkeys have 
trouble standing upright, develop lame and infected legs and hips, are not 
genetically diverse and are thus vulnerable to disease, and can only reproduce 
via artificial insemination. They can't fly and can barely walk. They're pumped 
full of antibiotics and fed not nuts, grains, and grass but high protein food, 
including slaughterhouse leftovers. Then they are stuffed into crates, taken 
to the slaughterhouse, and electrically stunned, often ineffectively. They die 
when their throats are cut, often after reviving from their electric stun. 
This is the center piece you buy for a few cents a pound. 

When picking a turkey... 

If you are leaning toward servin turkey, and you have the opportunity, visit 
or call some of the small suppliers, and confirm, either visually or by asking 
questions, that the farming and growing methods used are those you approve 
of. Make sure that no pesticides are used on plants and that healthy, 
non-engineered animals are raised according to their nature, rather than in an 
industrial manner, and are slaughtered humanely. Since most of us won't be able to get 
out to the farm, we suggest you:

Mr Macdonald was thrown in the air and trampled on
A Highland farmer has warned that new right to roam legislation will increase 
the danger of serious attacks from cattle. 
Shaun Macdonald, who farms at Conon Brae on the Black Isle in Ross-shire, has 
written to MSPs after he was crushed and had his nose broken after being 
attacked by one of his own cows. 
Mr Macdonald had been tagging a young calf along with a cattle-man when the 
angry mother suddenly turned on him, leaving him black and blue. 
He has called for the Scottish Executive to consider removing landowners' 
liability to prosecution in case the promotion of greater public access to land 
leads to accidents. 
 It needs to be taken on board that at some point we could have a fatality 
and then where will we point the finger?

    Undercover operations to expose the illegal trade in protected species 
are rescuing thousands of animals and decreasing demand for their pelts and body 
parts, but the operations also are provoking violence from criminal gangs. 
    A recent report by the international environmental organization Wild Aid 
revealed a series of gang-style killings related to the shark-fin trade in 
East Asia, a market dominated by Chinese triads. 
    In August, five person were killed in Fiji, apparently fighting for space 
in the black market. In February, a man sentenced to house arrest was slain 
in his home in Cape Town, South Africa, as part of the "Chinese mafia shark-fin 
war," the report said. 
    The Russian mafia and Latin American drug cartels also participate in 
illegal wildlife trade, while some poaching groups specializing in smuggling 
plants and animals or their parts using drug- and gun-smuggling routes. 
    In Europe, enforcement agents have been shot in gunfights with gangs, and 
in Latin America, several drug shipments have been discovered mixed with 
animals or plants. Snakes with bags of drugs inside are just a sample, according 
to a previous report by Traffic, of the World Wildlife Fund. 
    It showed, too, that the past two Chinese anti-poaching leaders in Tibet 
have been slain and that anti-poaching teams in many countries are often 
targets of assassination. 
    This type of trade is attracting organized criminals because of the high 
profits (up to 800 percent in some cases) and the lack of serious punishment, 
which leads to an estimated trade worth at least $6 billion annually in the 
world black markets. 
    "It's the most profitable illegal trade after drugs and guns," said Peter 
Knights, executive director of Wild Aid. 
    An example is rhinoceros horns, with prices of up to $40,000 per kilo, 
more than five times the price of gold, according to the organization Asian 
Conservation Awareness Program (ACAP). Not surprisingly, 97 percent of the world's 
rhinos were lost in the past 30 years. 
    Animals are wanted for food; for their skins, organs and bones; as exotic 
pets; or for traditional medicine in Asia. Several species are being pushed 
to the edge of extinction. The main markets are probably the United States and 
China. 
    In Cambodia, from 2001 to 2002, Wild Aid rescued 8,250 animals from 
illegal traders, helped apprehend 239 criminals and confiscate 1.3 tons of fresh 
meat and two tons of dried animal parts. 
    About 100 million sharks and shark-like fish are caught every year, and 
about 50 percent of them have their fins sliced off while still alive. Then, 
they are thrown back into the sea, where they sink and slowly die, so the rest 
of their bodies is wasted. 
    The fins are used for soup, an expensive delicacy in some parts of Asia, 
but finning has increased so much in recent years that fins are used even for 
canned cat food, said the Wild Aid report. ...
    Wild Aid regularly intercepts poachers, prevents them from killing 
animals and destroys their camps. It also goes undercover with hidden cameras to 
expose the traders' inner workings. 
    The gangs involved in illegal trade often take advantage of small 
communities. People in these communities do the killing or collecting and sell their 
catch cheap to the gangs, which profit. A parrot, for example, can be caught 
for $5 and sold commercially in the United States for $500. 
    International organizations send speakers to Third World communities to 
publicize alternative products and inform villagers and police about how to 
conserve wildlife. In Thailand, the poaching of some species has decreased 70 
percent with these efforts. 
    Campaigns in the media also have shown results. In Phnom Penh, Cambodia, 
where from 2001 to the end of last year more than 8,000 animals were rescued, 
75 percent of restaurants stopped serving wildlife dishes. 
    Wild Aid also operates an animal facility to care for creatures that are 
injured or have been in captivity too long to be released into the wild. 
    Not all wildlife trade is illicit. The Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species (CITES), signed by 164 countries, allows the commercial 
use of some species according to their extinction risks. 
    Noncompliance with the rules can lead to sanctions against trade coming 
from violator countries, said Simon Habel, director of Traffic North America. 
"But [illegal traders] know what they're doing ? clearly, corruption is an 
issue too," he said. 
    Some methods of smuggling involve falsifying certificates or sending 
animals to a country where it is not illegal to hunt them, then re-exporting them 
from there. Smugglers also hide wildlife in shipments of other goods and 
airport luggage.

In Belvidere, a 34-year-old mare named Molly folds to her knees in the shade 
of a tree and dies. Her owner feels guilty paying someone $250 to take her 
carcass away but at least knows Molly died at home on her terms. 
In Colorado, a teenage Appaloosa named Delilah has proven incorrigible. She?s 
unruly, even dangerous. Her owner takes her to an auction knowing that 
Delilah probably is headed to a slaughterhouse. 
The stories happened years apart, several states apart, to two horse owners 
who will never know each other and, if put together in a room, would consider 
the other an alien species. 
So it is with the question of what to do with old horses. 
Horse lovers are divided: Put the animal out of its misery? Let it die on its 
own? Send its body to a rendering plant where it will be turned into pet food 
or cosmetics? Or have it slaughtered for someone?s dinner in Europe? 
Now, the debate has made its presence known in the Rock River Valley in the 
form of two 12-by-25-foot billboards, one on Riverside Boulevard in Loves Park, 
the other on Illinois 120 in Woodstock, that decry slaughtering horses for 
people to eat. 
?Keep America?s Horses In The Stable And Off the Table!? they read. 
The billboards? sponsor, a Pennsylvania-based group called the Equine 
Protection Network, chose the Rockford area because it?s close to DeKalb, home to one 
of three slaughterhouses in the country that sell horse meat overseas for 
food.

Janine McCartney has a passion for cats -- a passion so strong that she has 
devoted a part of her life toward her fuzzy friends. 
McCartney has volunteered for the Cat Association of Topeka, 1719 S.W. Gage 
Blvd., since 1989. She also has served on its board for 10 years. 
McCartney has a magic touch with cats and is a licensed foster mom for C.A.T. 
When kittens need to be nursed to health or need to be bottle-fed, she 
dedicates the time to nurse them -- all with the ultimate goal of raising them and 
making them adoptable in the community. 

Janine McCartney has worked with the Cat Association of Topeka since 
1989.C.A.T. is a nonprofit, no-kill shelter that opened in 1989. The agency moved to 
its current location in July. 
"We renovated the building and did most of the work," McCartney said. 
The move took the help of many volunteers like McCartney. The cats and the 
staff are now settled in their new home -- a home dedicated to providing a safe 
place for the cats to reside until a match can be found for them. 
What prompted you to volunteer with C.A.T.? 
There was an ad in the paper when the association was getting organized. I 
attended the meeting, which was open to the public. I liked the idea of helping 
cats, so I started volunteering. I love all animals, but cats are easier to 
shelter. You could not have as many dogs here as you can cats. 
What is the best part of being with C.A.T.? 
Being with the cats. The reward is not in the paycheck. It's in perks, 
because they give back so much. There are a lot more people helping people than 
helping animals, especially cats. With a passion for cats, this is where I can 
help the cats. Coming here, I get to do what I like the most, be with the cats. 
The happiest time here is when someone comes in and fills out a pre-adoption 
form and walks out with the perfect cat. It's very rewarding. We have a lot of 
people who are dedicated. I've never worked so hard. You would not believe the 
things that people do to animals. That's why we're here. We know that the cats 
are safe. 
What do you consider your touch with cats? 
Fostering (kittens)... My goal is to bottle feed the kittens and get them to 
where they can be brought into the shelter and be adopted. The ultimate goal 
is always finding the perfect home. Sometimes that takes time. There is such an 
over-population of cats, so it takes quite a while before cats actually are 
adopted. Kittens are adopted faster. But some people do want adult cats. 
How do you keep yourself from getting attached (to the cats)? 
In the beginning I would adopt the cats myself. Then I got to the point that 
"No, that's not what a foster mom does." I can love them, take care of them 
and I have taught myself how to let go. Now it works for me being a foster mom. 
For a few years, I would just keep them. They do such a good job making the 
right match, that when a cat is adopted I feel very confident. I felt that I had 
kept so many of the fosters that I no longer had enough time to spend with 
each of them. Now I can do it. That's the goal of the foster home to be able to 
take care of them and love them and let go. 
What does your volunteer work at the shelter entail? 
I work retail and I do kennels once a month. That's a lot of work. It entails 
cleaning, feeding and medicating the cats, if necessary. 
What is the most challenging aspect of being at C.A.T.? 
We get a lot of calls from people who are needing help. We can't help 
everyone. Knowing how to help people, knowing how to answer their phone calls and how 
to help each individual. 
What was the remodeling process like with the new building? 
We did most of the work ourselves. Part of the building was new and the rest 
was a remodel. We had an interior decorator volunteer her services and picked 
out all the colors. It's a lot of paint and was really hard to paint all those 
colors. The cats now have colorful rooms and furniture. I'm just a small part 
of the C.A.T. Association. We had a lot of people who are dedicated and they 
just helped pull it together. It was a lot of hard work, I've never worked so 
hard.

        <docText>Analyzes McDonald's 
policy requiring its meat suppliers to limit use of antibiotics in meat 
production
New report examines industry implications of policy announced by one of 
world's largest meat purchasers
Bio Economic Research Associates, or bio-era(TM) (http://www.bio-era.net/), a 
leading independent research and advisory firm providing analysis on the 
future of the global bio economy, today announced the release of its latest 
research report entitled "McDonald's Global Policy on Antibiotic Use in Meat Supply: 
Implications for Food and Agriculture Supply Chains."
The report offers industry-wide, strategic analysis of McDonald's 
Corporation's policy announced in June 2003, which requires its direct suppliers of meat 
to phase out the use of certain antibiotics for animal growth promotion. The 
report analyzes new and strategic questions for companies in the food and 
agriculture value chain arising from the new McDonald's policy.
The report also explores the scientific and economic issues associated with 
antibiotic and synthetically-produced antimicrobial use in beef production, 
describing how and why these control agents are used, the effects, the health 
risks, and the possible strategic implications of initiatives by large buyers 
and/or by regulators to restrict the use of antibiotics for animal growth 
promotion.

f you out there, to help me by making sure
 that justice will be done!
 Hopefully many of you remember the email I sent out on Sept. 12,
 2003, titled "TN State Law is not being enforced". It was about a
 case where there were 7 dogs, two adults and 5 pups, here in Houston
 County, TN, totally emaciated. First the Sheriff Dept. turned the
 case over to me, but when it came to enforce the Law, they refused,
 told me to leave the property, and, to top it all, the Deputy helped
 the owner in removing the animals from the same property, so there
 wouldn't be any evidences.
 I contacted the media, and asked for help to all I knew of, but no
 one helped! The thought of those poor creatures has been hunting me
 ever since.
 Last night, Nov. 1st, 2003, at 9:29 pm Central time, the 911 Houston
 Co. dispatcher, called me seeking my assistance in an animal cruelty
 case. I was put in contact with one of the two deputies at that
 location, and he told me that his supervisor, who is also the
 Sheriff's brother,  asked to get me out there to handle the case.
 A visiting friend of mine, and I left right away, and went to the
 location, which is only couple of blocks away from the location of
 the Sept. 12 case. Ironically I told my friend that it better not be
 the dogs! Once we arrived, I started to question the deputy to see if
 he knew, at that point, who the owner of the dogs was: SAME OWNER,
 SAME DOGS!!!!
 The deputy pointed at the small kennel where there were 5 pups, some
 dead, some still alive, and said that he couldn't go any closer to it
 because of the stinch. In the kennel we noticed moldy, and rotten dog
 food, a little pan with rain water in it, that was behind
 description, and maggots everywhere! Into a plastic container,
 resembling some kind of wast basket, there were two rotten pups, and
 three starving ones, that were feeding off the dead ones. There was
 no sight of the two adult dogs, although the smell pointed right at a
 parked vehicle.
 I demanded for the Sheriff, and/or the deputy brother of his, and/or
 the Assistant DA to talk to me and to come to the location. No one
 called. No one came.
 At this point the owner was threating us to get off his propery. The
 deputy tried to reason with him, and at last he consented to turn the
 pups over to us. Meantime, the deputy who was present during the
 Sept. 12 case, showed up, and we ended up just screaming at each
 other, because I made him look at those bodies, that he helped the
 owner with their removal on Sept. 12. Next thing, he was on the phone
 with the Assistant DA, and both ordered me to put the three pups
 back, or they would arrest me right there and then for theft, and
 trespass. 
 I have too many medical conditions to end up in jail on a Saturday
 night, especially when the Assistant DA himself  stated he would make
 sure I didn't get any help at least until the following Monday.
 We made it home at past 1:30 am, Nov. 2, 2003, with the above
 mentioned location only about 15 minutes away. We where there that
 whole time. I'm still expecting the Sheriff Dept. to come after me in
 one way or another.
 I'm begging each and everyone of you to help in seeking justice!!
 With all respect for other cruelty cases, we are not talking about a
 dirty food dish, nor dogs laying in their own feces, which is really
 bad, but nothing compare to this atrocity!!!!!

Federal agents are demanding DNA swabs and palm prints from an activist
Detroit couple in connection with an attempted bombing at a west Michigan
water bottling plant.

Marie Mason and her husband, Frank Ambrose, say they're targets of a
federal campaign of intimidation designed to shut up loudmouthed
environmental protesters in Michigan. They will ask a judge to throw out
subpoenas for the palm prints and DNA that FBI agents surprised them with
on Oct. 27.
...
The radical group Earth Liberation Front immediately took credit for the
bomb. ELF is a shadowy, loose-knit group that has engaged in a stepped-up
campaign of sabotage and arson over the last several years, targeting
symbols of environmentalists' ire, including gas-guzzling Hummer SUVs and
new subdivisions in formerly rural areas.
...
In an e-mail to an environmental Internet discussion group after the
bombing, Massasauga Earth First! members wrote that the group "applauds
the Earth Liberation Front's attempt to damage Ice Mountain's pumping
station," but said Earth First! had no knowledge of or role in the crime.

        <docText>Dozens of long-standing residents of Santa Catalina
Island are trading their ocean views for a vast playground in the Great
Plains ? though not by choice.

About a third of the Southern California island's 300 bison were shipped
off this week to South Dakota, where they will live on two Indian
reservations. They were expected to arrive Thursday.

Their trip has been nearly a year in the making as conservationists and
animal welfare advocates worked to find an amicable solution to a
decades-old problem: The nonnative animals have destroyed island plant
life as their numbers have swelled.

"They didn't want to go," joked Bill Dyer, regional director of In Defense
of Animals, which raised more than $25,000 for travel expenses. "We are
happy that the Indian tribes are taking the animals with the understanding
that the bison would not be slaughtered."</docText>

Last week, the Boca Raton Planning &amp; Zoning Board recommended against the
application of Suspended Animation Inc. to build a laboratory.
...
Experiments would be done on about 100 rats a year, the company has said.
This has brought furious opposition from animal-rights supporters --
though I'll bet many other animal lovers would gladly off a few rats if it
meant a chance to bring their Fido back.

In voting 6-0 against Suspended Animation's application, Planning &amp; Zoning
Board members said they weren't swayed by the animal-rights crowd or by
suspicions that cryonics is more Woody Allen's Sleeper than an actual
science. They said the business just didn't fit city plans.

Imagine the CEO of Weyerhaeuser appointed to run the national forests. As 
part of the deal, he gets to keep his old job. Federal law wouldn't allow 
it, of course. It's a simple conflict of interest. But when it comes to the 
folks who regulate ocean fishing, conflicts of interest are not only 
permissible, they're a regular part of the game.

Consider Sean Martin of Hawaii, and the four hats he wears.

As a fisherman, Martin earns a living from the sea. He owns a business that 
sells equipment so others can, too. As an activist, he heads a trade group 
that is fighting environmental regulations to protect endangered sea 
turtles. And as a regulator, he recently voted to open fishing in areas and 
ways that have been proven harmful to endangered species.

Martin and his business partner, Jim Cook &#x2014; himself a council member in 
1990s &#x2014; have had it both ways: they help make the rules, and they profit 
from the rules. And on occasion, Martin and Cook have been prosecuted for 
breaking those very rules.

Martin is one of 13 members of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery 
Management Council (known as &#x201c;Wespac&#x201d;), a position Cook held throughout the 
1990s. Congress created the council in 1976 as one of eight that govern U.S. 
waters in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific. Wespac 
governs close to 50 percent of U.S. waters, an area of ocean as large as the 
other councils' areas combined.

        <docText>It's been a couple of decades since I sat in a Berkeley
auditorium listening to Timothy Leary, the 1960s drug guru and
revolutionary, rail about the decline of American culture. But one of his
observations has remained especially fresh in my memory. He was talking
about George Orwell's dystopian classic, "1984," in which every home had a
"telescreen," a sort of television monitor through which Big Brother could
watch people in their homes.

"As it turns out, things are even worse than Orwell predicted," Leary
ranted. "Yes, there's a screen in every house. But people are just sitting
around staring at it."

Leary's lament came to mind again the other day when I learned that the
Food and Drug Administration was considering giving biotechnology
companies the green light to sell meat and milk from cloned animals. Like
many kids who grew up in the 1950s, I read lots of science fiction books
about future societies in which people no longer sat down to eat real food
but got all their nutrition from a pill - futures that struck me as sadly
devoid of the rich cultural fabric of meal time, sociality and family.
...
And I realize that, while I do participate in today's animal economy, I
and most people I know are less sanguine about the trajectory of meat
production than we used to be. I realize that, while I do not know what
"animal rights" really means, I do see in many animals a familiar sense of
self-awareness that lately seems deserving of more, rather than less,
sympathy and respect. And I realize that what bothers me most about the
prospect of a new and burgeoning market in replicated animals is that it
represents a move completely counter to the way I wish things were going
with regard to the relationship between us and our phylogenetic cousins.

        <docText>In five years, Pete and Tania Smith made a living off the land 
in the Chautauqua County hills, building a home where the buffalo roam, and 
the elk, red stags and Russian boars, too. 
But at the same time, they arrived near the epicenter of one of the most 
bitterly debated cultural and political issues in America. 
The Smiths converted a former dairy farm into a hunting preserve they named 
Creekside Whitetail. 
They charge hunters big bucks to stalk and shoot the animals that wander a 
fenced-in, 400-acre portion of their property - an area about one-third the size 
of Erie County's Chestnut Ridge Park. 
"This is farming," said Pete Smith. 
He also runs archery and taxidermy businesses at the site, sells deer scent 
from his breeding stock and produces a cable television show for Empire and the 
Outdoor Channel on his 800-acre farm. 
The Smiths are part of a movement to find alternative uses for the 
out-of-business farms that dot upstate New York's countryside. Today, more than 100 of 
these hunting preserves are scattered around upstate's countryside, and another 
seven or eight - mostly specializing in smaller animals such as game birds - 
are in Western New York. 
"We raise animals," Smith said. "They're born and raised here. New York State 
calls this "alternative livestock,' which is exactly what it is."

During a nostalgic moment not long ago, I opened a can of beef ravioli, stuff 
I devoured as a kid. 
I couldn't wait to taste it, to revert, for a moment, to my childhood days. I 
took a bite and - yuck! - spat it out.
It was just plain nasty.
I checked out the label, trying to understand why, and saw a list of 
ingredients that seemed like something out of Dr. Evil's laboratory.
What were monosodium glutamate, caramel coloring, modified corn starch and 
enzyme modified cheese doing in there?
Something sinister happened to our food during the workplace revolution.
Food manufacturers started selling convenience foods that resembled real 
meals.
Heat and eat was their mantra. Working moms everywhere started snatching up 
frozen TV dinners, canned dinners and "add water and stir" meals.
But it's food that's so overprocessed, much of its original nutrients are 
gone. In its place are salt and fat - stuff that tastes good but later leaves you 
feeling lethargic and hungry.
Supermarkets are filled with that stuff. The consumer backlash only went so 
far.
The federal government doesn't force food manufacturers to make their foods 
healthier. They just require labels that tell consumers there is zero 
nutritional value.
So those of us looking for healthy food that doesn't contain synthetic 
additives, unnecessary preservatives and other chemicals shop at health food 
supermarkets, such as Whole Foods.
We buy organic apples because pesticides scare us. We prefer free-range 
chicken and hormone-free beef - the kind of food our parents used to eat when they 
were little.
We read labels. And we depend on the federal government to figure out what's 
unhealthy and either ban it from the marketplace or require full disclosure on 
the labels.
It's a given that we should know what we're ingesting. Right?
Well that may not be the case with beef, pork and chicken coming from cloned 
animals.
That's right. Cloned animal meat may be coming to a supermarket near you.
The federal Food and Drug Administration is planning to determine by next 
spring whether meat from cloned animals should be allowed to be sold for 
consumption.
Last week, an FDA advisory committee released a report saying that after 
reviewing numerous studies - mostly of cloned cattle - it found no significant 
differences between cloned animals and naturally bred ones.
I'm fine with cloning animals in the name of science. But in the wealthiest 
nation in the world, there's no need to breed animals for us to eat when they 
can be reproduced naturally.
Even if the FDA decides, after exhaustive studies, that it's OK to sell 
chicken breast, ham and pork chops that came from cloned animals, they should 
require a huge label on the package so those of us who want to bypass it - and I 
have to believe that includes most of us - can move on to the real thing.
Otherwise, a whole lot of us are going to become vegetarians.

  Dog trainer Kasha Winston approached the 75-pound pit bull and 
mastiff mix, leaning toward its chain-link kennel in the city?s animal shelter. 
?Are you a nice boy?? she asked in a sugary voice. 

 The lean, muscular dog stood up on his hind legs, his front paws on the 
fence, his face inches from Winston?s. He growled. 
Winston stepped back quickly, shaking her head. ?I didn?t think so,?? she 
said. 
She jotted a note on her pad. 
A few kennels down, a pit bull-mix puppy greeted her by rolling on its back 
playfully when Winston opened its cage door and petted it. 
Winston was assessing which newly arrived animals were suitable for adoption. 
A few months ago, neither dog would have been a candidate because of the 
Norfolk Animal Management Center?s long-standing practice of euthanizing pit 
bulls. 
The city reversed the policy in September, and is now making some members of 
the controversial and often-abused breed available to those seeking pets. 
For years, concerns about pit bulls? potential for aggression, coupled with 
fears that new owners would train them for the fighting pit, kept the dogs off 
the adoption list. 
The only pit bulls that left the shelter were lost animals reclaimed by their 
owners. 
Shelters across the country attempt to match pets and owners, and more of 
them are initiating temperament testing programs, said Betsy McFarland, program 
manager for animal shelter issues with the Humane Society of the United States. 
Effective laws and policies target dangerous animals, not specific breeds, 
she said. Still, the Humane Society does ?recognize and support that many 
shelters choose not to adopt out pit bulls because of the high prevalence of 
dogfighting in their communities,?? McFarland wrote in an e-mail. 
Norfolk?s policy change reflects a belief that pit bulls can be suitable 
pets, and should be judged by ?deed, not breed.?? 
The deeds have been, at times, vicious 
. Pit bulls have ravaged each other in organized fights in Norfolk. 
Authorities have confiscated wounded dogs, dog-fighting videos and other accoutrements 
of the bloody contests.

The first head-to-head trial of four popular diet plans -- Atkins, Dean
Ornish, Weight Watchers and the Zone -- has found that people who stick
with any of them for a year lose about 5 percent of their body weight, far
fewer pounds than most dieters hope for. At least a third of the dieters
in the four plans drop out before the year is up.
...
About half of those in both the Atkins group (very low carbohydrate, high
fat) and the Ornish group (very low fat, high carbohydrate vegetarian)
dropped out before the study was completed. About a third dropped out of
the Weight Watchers group (low fat, moderate calorie, similar to the diet
advocated by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines) and the Zone (which relies on a
system to track how much food raises blood sugar levels). "The more
extreme diets like Atkins and Ornish were tougher to follow than the Zone
and Weight Watchers," said Michael Dansinger, the lead author of the study.

All four groups showed about 3 percent weight loss overall over the year
-- equivalent to a 200-pound person trimming about six pounds. But among
those who stuck with their diets for the entire year, results were
slightly better, ranging from a 4 percent loss for Atkins to 6 percent for
the Ornish group. Both the Weight Watchers and the Zone dieters lost about
5 percent.

        <docText>You've undoubtedly heard of having therapy. But you may never 
have heard of having a therapy session with a rabbit. 
But that's exactly what Northfield Elementary School teacher Pam Bernardini 
offers once a week. She heads off with her rabbit Jillian, as well as a 
fifth-grade student from the school, to visit the Mayo Healthcare facility in 
Northfield to brighten the day of the facility's senior citizen residents. 
Jillian is certified to provide animal-assisted activities and therapy to the 
elderly and disabled. 
"I've had rabbits for the past 15 years or so," Bernardini said. "I had heard 
about the positive effect pets can have on senior citizens, so three years 
ago I went to Middlebury to attend a Pet Partners training course." 
Pet Partners, established in 1990 by the non-profit Delta Society, based in 
Portland, Ore., is a program that establishes guidelines for person-animal 
volunteer teams to qualify them to enter hospitals, nursing homes, and other 
facilities. 
The nationwide program registers teams that successfully complete health and 
temperament screening and volunteer training. Pet Partner animals include 
dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, domesticated rats, horses, and potbellied pigs. 
"I took the day-long course with my Flemish Giant rabbit Emma, to learn how 
to become a therapy rabbit," Bernardini said. "I worked with Emma on the things 
that we learned, and a year later we returned to Middlebury to become tested 
and certified." 
After passing the test, the rabbit became a regular visitor at the Mayo 
Healthcare facility in Northfield. 
Emma died last year and Bernardini adopted Jillian, an English Lop rabbit 
from Saco, Maine, a month later. English Lops are big rabbits with extremely long 
ears that alone are conversation stoppers. 
The teacher immediately began training the new pet, and on Sept. 13th she 
took Jillian to be tested for Pet Partners certification. Rated on temperament, 
appearance, grooming, obedience, and the performance of specific tasks, Jillian 
scored 35 out of a possible 36 points. 
Bernardini has resumed her schedule of visiting the Mayo nursing home once a 
week to work with the residents. 
"Sometimes people who are shy and reserved seem to identify with a rabbit 
more than with a dog or another animal," Bernardini said. "A therapy pet often 
opens up conversations about pets that the residents once had, and they become 
very attached to them. It's a change in their day." 
Bernardini also sees a positive effect on the children in her class, who take 
turns accompanying the teacher to the nursing home. 
"It is good for 10-year-old kids to recognize the importance of volunteering 
their time to work with others. They enjoy meeting the senior citizens and 
talking to them." 
Mayo Healthcare Activities Director Kim Marcotte agreed that the visits 
benefit everyone. 
"The rabbit has a very calming effect on the residents," Macotte said. "There 
is also wonderful interaction between the generations. 
Children and animals bring life to an institution, and the combination of the 
two make the visits extra special for the people here."

Gretta and Ravi Hunjan, of Denver, are making all the necessary preparations 
for the arrival of their new baby in a few weeks, but mixed with their joy is 
a real concern for how 2 ?-year-old Zoey will respond.
"Zoey is our first 'child,' and she's completely the center of our 
attention," Gretta says. "We can't explain to her what's happening, and we're worried 
she'll feel jealous and neglected and may even try to hurt the baby somehow."
Zoey is a dog, a Lab mix that, Gretta says, "needs a lot of attention."
Such concern is neither unusual nor misplaced. Many dogs serve as surrogate 
children, and just as wise parents take steps to prepare older children for the 
arrival of a new sibling, so do they take steps to prepare the family pet as 
well.
Bastyr suggests playing a recording of baby sounds to help acclimate the 
dog. "When a baby comes there will be a lot of new sounds they haven't heard 
before," Bastyr says. "Especially screaming. They may mistake the baby's screams 
for a distress cry, which could make them engage in some predatory behavior."
Once the baby is born, bring home something with the baby's and mom's scent, 
Bastyr advises. Let the dog sniff it, and give him a treat.
When mom comes home from the hospital, Bastyr advises greeting the dog first, 
without the baby. After five to 10 minutes, bring the baby in and give the 
dog lots of praise and treats. "Then let the dog sniff and lick the baby's feet 
to get that first little taste," she says. "They'll be curious."
But never, ever leave even the best-behaved dog alone with a baby even for a 
few seconds, she warns.
Finally, there's the issue of the diapers. There's no polite way to say this, 
but just remember to keep the diaper pail secure and tightly locked at all 
times, lest your dog be tempted to help himself to a tasty treat. That's not 
just disgusting, it's also possibly harmful to the dog, as he could choke and 
possibly suffocate on a disposable diaper.

Damian Aspinall, all 6ft 3in of him, is sitting awkwardly in his armchair in 
front of a fake fire in the drawing room of his huge Chelsea home. 
It's a magnificent place with a huge central staircase spiralling up towards 
the heavens, but instead of being full of antiques, it's stuffed to the gills 
with paintings of animals - deer, birds, monkeys, giraffes, elephants and, of 
course, gorillas. "Yes, the gorillas!" says Aspinall, referring to the 
primates at Howletts, the zoo in Kent his father, the legendary John Aspinall, set up 
many years ago. 
"When the gorillas haven't seen me for a while," he says, "they race to the 
edge of their pen so I can stroke them. I remember doing it as a child. It was 
so comforting and amazing." He is obviously entranced by animals in the same 
way his father was. He bounces up and down on his chair when he tells me about 
his latest wheeze. "We've taken them back to Africa!" he says. 
He and his friend, designer Patrick Cox, and Aspinall's girlfriend and mother 
of his baby daughter, the TV presenter Donna Air, have just made a 
documentary about releasing seven gorillas back into the wild in Gabon. "Everyone thinks 
we're crazy," he says. "All those animal-world people keep telling us that 
the gorillas won't cope. I disagree. We have bred more animals in Howletts - 
gorillas, elephants and black rhino - than anywhere else in the world. I know 
what I'm doing."

        <docText> Beth Herr was ecstatic. 
For months, the curator of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation had been 
following the movements of the park's 50-year-old wood turtles, an endangered species, 
and trying to improve possible nesting areas to encourage their breeding. A 
radio signal from the tiny transmitter on one turtle's back indicated she had 
stopped at a sandy pit built earlier in the summer by Eagle Scouts. 
"She poked her head up and I realized she was laying eggs," said Herr, who 
intended to come back later to protect the nest from predators. "I was so 
excited." 
She was also too slow. The turtle had deposited 62 eggs in three holes, but 
by the time Herr returned she found the nesting holes enlarged by claws, 
probably from a marauding raccoon, and all the eggs devoured. 
"It was so sad," Herr said. 
Such is the cycle of life and death in Westchester County's largest park, 
where curators have waged a concerted effort to improve breeding and feeding 
conditions for a variety of wildlife. For the past 15 years, curators have 
carefully chronicled and monitored the health of the inhabitants of the six 
ecosystems within the 4,700-acre park. Monitoring the breeding habits of the elderly 
turtles is just one of the latest efforts to improve the park's biological 
diversity and stem the loss of varying species of plants and animals. 
Volunteers and park curators spend thousands of hours each year on habitat 
improvement and scientific projects ranging from the low-tech sandboxes, used by 
turtles for egg laying, to the high-tech, water- and mud-proof radio 
transmitters fitted onto their shells. The curators have developed species management 
projects for each ecological system in the reservation. So far, those efforts 
have attracted more than 1,000 distinct species of plants, bugs, birds and 
animals, a level of biological diversity unmatched at any other county park. 

Park employees have encountered groups wading in the streams during picnics 
to catch and grill crayfish or gathering bags full of fiddlehead ferns for 
their salads. So the park has begun posting signs alerting visitors that what's in 
the park is for viewing, not hunting. In boggy areas, there are also signs 
alerting motorists to frog and salamander crossings. 
"During breeding season," Herr said, "we close the road because if the wea
ther is right, there can be 200 to 300 of them on the road, and people would just 
drive right over them. We want them undisturbed."

The contract to operate the District's animal shelter is worth less than $2 
million per year, a tiny fraction of the city's $5.6 billion budget. But when 
District officials dropped the Washington Humane Society and selected a 
little-known Canadian firm for the job, animal-rights groups in town reacted with 
large-scale outrage. 
They bombarded the offices of Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) and the D.C. 
Council with angry telephone calls, flooded their computers with e-mail and showed 
up by the dozens at a public council hearing to denounce the selection. 
Before long, the city canceled the contract with the company and reopened 
negotiations with the local organization, which has operated the shelter for most 
of the past 20 years. 
To Humane Society Executive Director Jody Huckaby, the response was a 
spontaneous outpouring of support for its commitment to the city's animals. 
"We've been here 133 years," Huckaby said. "Generations know our society. 
"It's not like we don't have deep roots in the District. There's a real bond 
and connection there. People really care about the Washington Humane Society." 
But to others, the Humane Society's reemergence raised concerns. Those 
critics contend that the society, supported by deep political connections, has too 
much power and influence, which discourages competitors. 
"I'm one of the many who feel the Washington Humane Society has bullied their 
way back in there," said Mary Rowse, an animal-rights activist who has 
volunteered at area shelters.

  Kelly Savoy is back at the scene of an crime. 

The Humane Society investigator holds one of the survivors, a mixed-breed 
blue heeler puppy named Lucky, in her arms.

Last week, Savoy and other animal rescue workers found the puppy trapped in 
an abandoned house inside a pet carrier. When it was freed from its cage, Lucky 
could barely walk to freedom.

Twelve dogs and nine cats weren?t as lucky when Crowley animal control 
officers arrived at the 100 block of McMullin Street. The other animals were so 
malnourished and parasite-infested that they were euthanized. 

Pictures captured that day show dogs with rib cages visible under skin barely 
covered with patches of fur.

Shari and Ernie Pedigo were arrested and charged with 21 counts of cruelty to 
animals. More cruelty charges are pending against the couple because rabbits 
and ducks were found on a return visit to the property.

The case is still under investigation.

The couple had 12 dogs, nine cats, 29 rabbits and five ducks. Two of the 
rabbits were dead. Two rabbits living in a cage with the rotting carcasses had to 
be euthanized because they were diseased. 

The ducks were so malnourished that they had lost their feathers. Some of the 
dogs and cats stayed inside a trailer on the property with the couple, while 
the rest were outside or in the abandoned house.

Last week, the scene in the yard of the McMullin trailer and an adjacent 
abandoned house was tough, said Janet Lyons, another Humane Society investigator. 

The yard was filled with feces and animal carcasses, Lyons said. 

?I had garbage bags tied at my knees and wore gloves,? she said.

Federal agents show up at Jello Biafra speech, arrest student in
connection with false testimony
...
Chico State senior Harjit Gill said his cell phone rang near the beginning
of Jello Biafra's show in Bell Memorial Union Auditorium on Wednesday
night. It was FBI Agent Chad Coulter and he had a warrant for Gill's arrest.

Gill said he told Coulter, "I'm not running from you. Come get me." Then
he informed Coulter of his location.

Coulter, along with another FBI agent and a University police officer,
arrested Gill during Biafra's performance on one count of giving false
testimony to a grand jury and two counts of lying to a federal officer.
All three counts are considered perjury. 
...
The charges are related to a Grand Jury investigation in July concerning
the Animal Liberation Front. Gill said he was brought in because he is a
political activist.

"I'm not linked in any way to the Animal Liberation Front other than the
fact that I'm in philosophical agreement with it," he said. "I'm not a
participant in any way."

FBI Special Agent Karen Ernst said Gill was arrested based on a criminal
complaint of giving a false declaration to a Grand Jury. 
...
Gill also said that he never had his rights read to him and that he spent
six hours in a holding cell in the basement of the Sacramento County
Courthouse. He said he told guards that he was a vegetarian and lactose
intolerant, but nobody seemed to listen.

"I was given a bologna sandwich three times," he said. "I was also given a
packet of Kool-Aid without a cup or water. I guess I was just expected to
savor the flavor of cherry in my mouth for a while."

OMG!


CLACKAMAS COUNTY - It's the worst case of wildlife poaching that local game 
officers have ever seen, and it was discovered in Portland's backyard. 
Last week KATU's Grant McOmie reported the worst illegal garbage dump that 
land managers had ever seen. 
Nearly 100 yards of household trash was left in the Mt. Hood National Forest. 
Disgusting? You bet! 
But it's nothing compared to what trooper Mike Hansen showed KATU Wednesday 
morning. 
Forty-nine Canadian Geese were shot and dumped off Maple Lane in Clackamas 
County. 
The geese, each weighing 10 pounds or more, were killed and thrown to rot in 
a creek bed in last four days. 
"Obviously they did a lot of shooting - took a lot of birds and just wasted 
them," said officer Mike Hanson. 
Wildlife biologists said it might be a case of 'poaching opportunity,' as 
thousands of geese pass through our area at this time of year. 
"Sometimes its greed, sometimes it's opportunity, sometimes it's even 
frustration with heavy goose use on a property, there may be some frustration from 
the landowner," said biologist Don Vandebergh. 
What makes this so terrible is the absolute waste of the animals, this is not 
the case of an illegal hunter, this is an outright poaching case. 
More importantly, Oregon State Police - Fish and Wildlife is going to need 
all the help they can get from the public to find the criminals. 
If you have any information about this crime call: 
TIP: 'Turn-in-a-Poacher' 1-800-452-7888 
OSP Game Officer Mike Hanson: 731-3027, extension 427. 
Officer Hanson has few clues to this wildlife crime and he could use your 
help. 
"Hunters, birdwatchers, everyone - I mean these are their birds! To just 
shoot them and dump them is unbelievable," said Hanson.

Some wetlands, like this 14-acre site at Romeo Plank north of Hall, are too 
wet, too dry or stocked with plants not strong enough to survive..


Michigan has lost hundreds of wetlands to development, land that is vital to 
everything from providing homes for animals to preventing pesticides from 
seeping into the groundwater. 
Lax state oversight has diluted a law mandating the replacement of every inch 
of wetland destroyed by construction. More than half of the 775 wetlands that 
were supposed to be built in the past decade are inadequate. Some are too 
dry, too small, lack the proper drainage or have the wrong type of foliage. 
At least 125 were never built, according to state records. 
"It's sad that the wetlands are gone ... and it makes me mad that nobody is 
really watching," said Nancy Orewyler, a Chesterfield Township homemaker and 
environmentalist. 
The 1979 law requiring the construction of man-made wetlands for lost natural 
ones is tough to enforce because of manpower. The state has 32 environmental 
inspectors to oversee 2,200 wetlands -- almost 70 apiece. There are five 
inspectors total in sprawl-choked Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. 
Michigan officials said they're working to remedy the situation uncovered by 
a 2001 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The state has 
since hired five more inspectors and plans to hire another one this month in 
Livonia.

Scientists say the Barbary macaque monkeys who live on the Rock of Gibraltar 
are a rare population vital to primate research.

But to local tourism officials they have become a nuisance--an aggressive, 
30-pound nuisance with a dangerous taste for chocolate and a flair for theft.

The dispute has pitted the government of Gibraltar--which ordered 27 of the 
monkeys killed this summer--against researchers, who maintain the macaques 
would have returned to the hills if townspeople could resist offering them junk 
food.

Robert Martin, vice president of Chicago's Field Museum, spent eight years 
studying one 60-member macaque group before the summertime cull cut its numbers 
in half. Martin said officials killed the monkeys without calling him or the 
head of the group managing the population.

In protest, Martin has withdrawn from field research on Gibraltar. He is even 
boycotting the macaque conference he organized there this month.

"I give up," said Martin. "There's no point in continuing. They destroyed 
what we were doing."

The government says the monkeys started it. For whatever reason, probably 
overcrowding on top of the Rock, a troop of them scampered down from the hills 
this summer and descended on the small fishing and tourist town of Catalan Bay.

Once there, officials said the macaques were like college students on spring 
break.

Wildlife experts tried to lure them back to their home with a trail of 
cookies and peanuts. They tried to scare them out of town by brandishing blowguns 
used to anesthetize them in the past. Nothing worked for long.</docText>

Scoffing at fears of disease or animal protection laws, most residents in Shanghai have eaten wildlife such as frogs, tortoises and snakes and a large portion of these will do so again, a survey said Sunday. 

The study carried out in the wake of the Severa Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak -- suspected to have been triggered by wild animal consumption -- found that out of 400 Shanghainese, 83 percent admitted to eating wildlife. 

And despite warnings against eating exotic creatures, only 57.5 percent of respondents said they would spare wildlife from their dinner table, the Xinhua news agency said. 

Of these, only 1.9 percent said they would hold back because animals deserve to be protected.

Up to 12 pairs of eyes have peered back at Chris Pilkington when he has looked out his window at night. And those dozen coyotes are making him jittery. 

He thinks coyotes are responsible for the death of seven of his goats over the last six months, including his beloved Rosebud - his pet of 12 years.
He's afraid for his 75-year-old mother, who likes to spend her days outdoors gardening. He's afraid for his Dalmatian and his black cat. And, recently, he has started fearing for his own safety. 

The coyotes, once afraid to come out in the daytime, now casually stroll across the field in front of his 5-acre parcel at all times of the day. They don't flinch when he comes outside. He has to make a racket to scare them off. He said it's unsettling.

NICHOLSON, Pa. - It was a clear, crisp September night when former Pennsylvania Game Commission officer Joe Wenzel parked his vehicle off the road on a secluded lane in Luzerne County.

Although he already put in a full day at the office and was tired, Wenzel had a hunch something was brewing and had to be out there.

Barely an hour passed when Wenzel heard three shots break the silence down the road. With his windows down, he heard the exhaust of a truck rumbling toward him.

The truck stopped in front of Wenzel, unaware of his hidden state vehicle, and a spotlight illuminated a fat four-point buck. As Wenzel watched, another shot rang out from the truck and the buck collapsed.

Pets like these need a foster or adoptive home. 
A few volunteers are needed to help save some Triangle dogs' lives.
While the Durham Animal Protection Society is improving its shelter, 54 dogs 
need temporary homes through foster care or adoption.
Renovations will help the quality of life for the animals in the long run but 
if they can't find homes while the work is going on, the alternatives are not 
good.
There are more than 100 dogs that the APS of Durham routinely shelters at any 
one time. But beginning early next month, half of the dogs and puppies won't 
have any place to stay while a renovation project continues. That could mean a 
terrible outcome for some of these animals.
?Unfortunately we do have to humanely euthanize dogs that do not get placed 
into homes,? said Durham APS Manager Jennifer Sherian.
But the folks at the Durham APS always have the best interest of the dogs at 
heart. That's the whole reason for this million-dollar expansion and 
renovation project.
"We'll be able to house more animals with indoor/outdoor runs,? Sherian 
continued. ?Right now, because of the overpopulation that we're seeing we're having 
to house animals on both sides, meaning the animals do not have the luxury of 
sleeping and eating in one side of their run and urinating and defecating in 
the other side. It makes it very difficult for them. Just quality of life will 
be increased."
As part of the changes, the floors will be resurfaced and sealed and the 
walls will be repainted. Better facilities will also help fight disease, making 
for better efficiency and safety for both the staff and animals.
But without foster parents or more adoptions, many of these animals will have 
to pay the ultimate price for these improvements.
"It's just a very trying time with having to find homes whether through 
adoption or through fostering to place these animals during renovation, Sherian 
said. ?It's very stressful."
She adds if you can't help by adopting one of these Durham animals, the next 
best thing is to make sure pets are spayed and neutered. That will help fight 
this overcrowding at all shelters in the region.

Association says raids targeting illegal trade in wildlife are harming 
animals, legitimate firms 
Zoo operators yesterday asked the authorities to halt raids of privately 
operated zoos, saying the stings had hurt business and adversely affected their 
animals. 
Forestry officials and police recently raided three private zoos in Chon 
Buri, Uthai Thani and Bangkok as part of a government initiative to stamp out the 
illegal trade in wild animals and endangered species. 
The raids followed a crackdown earlier this month on a wildlife-trade ring 
based in Nonthaburi, in which a large number of rare and endangered animals were 
discovered, most of them already killed and butchered. 
The Association for Thai Zoos, which includes over 100 private and state 
zoos, called a press conference yesterday at the offices of the Zoological Park 
Organisation (ZPO) to demand that further raids be postponed. 
The association said many private zoos were awaiting official permission to 
breed wild animals and also urged the authorities to better distinguish between 
legitimate zoo operators and illegal wildlife traders. 
Association chairman Sophon Damnui, who also serves as ZPO director, said the 
raids had demoralised zoo operators all over the country, fearing their 
premises could be next. 
Sophon, said most private zoo operators complied with wildlife laws. He also 
called on members of the public to report zoo operators involved in the 
maltreatment of animals. 
Also present at yesterday?s press conference were association advisers Pisit 
na Patalung, secretary-general of the Wildlife Fund of Thailand, and Senator 
Jaroon Yangprapakorn, whose family owns a private zoo in Samut Prakan. 
Pisit said that searches of zoos could have a negative impact on animals in 
captivity. Some of them could suffer shock, he said, while others might be 
unable to bear offspring for a long period. 
Meanwhile, a source said the ZPO ordered the transfer of Chiang Mai Zoo 
director Thanong Nateepitak. 
Thanong has been appointed deputy director of the ZPO, amid speculation that 
he was unable to cope with the additional workload in Chiang Mai following the 
arrival of two pandas on loan from China. 
Sophon insisted, however, that the new appointment was a promotion for 
Thanong.

The genetically engineered pet appears to have arrived. 
In a development that is likely to inspire both fascination and alarm, a 
Texas company said Monday that it would soon start selling a genetically 
engineered aquarium fish that glows in the dark. 
The GloFish, as it is called, is a zebra fish containing a gene from a sea 
coral that makes the fish bright red under normal light and fluorescent under 
ultraviolet light. Zebra fish, about an inch-and-a-half long, are normally 
silver and black. 
The company selling the fish, Yorktown Technologies, of Austin, calls the 
fish ?a miracle of science? and said sales would begin on January 5 through pet 
stores. 
Genetic engineering of animals has until now been performed mainly for 
scientific research or medical purposes, for instance to make mice that get a 
certain disease. Making glow-in-the-dark fish extends the technology into the realm 
of human amusement, which might raise some eyebrows. Indeed, an artist who 
made a glow-in-the-dark rabbit a few years ago as an artwork attracted criticism 
for undermining the dignity of life for trivial purposes. 
Some environmental groups, led by the Center for Food Safety in Washington, 
are trying to delay the sale of the fish for another reason, saying it should 
first be reviewed by federal regulators. The groups say the fish might enter 
natural waterways if people dump out their aquariums and upset the natural 
balance in ecosystems.

George W. Bush will go down in history as America's worst environmental 
president. In a ferocious three-year attack, the Bush administration has initiated 
more than 200 major rollbacks of America's environmental laws, weakening the 
protection of our country's air, water, public lands and wildlife. Cloaked in 
meticulously crafted language designed to deceive the public, the 
administration intends to eliminate the nation's most important environmental laws by the 
end of the year. Under the guidance of Republican pollster Frank Luntz, the 
Bush White House has actively hidden its anti-environmental program behind 
deceptive rhetoric, telegenic spokespeople, secrecy and the intimidation of 
scientists and bureaucrats. The Bush attack was not entirely unexpected. George W. 
Bush had the grimmest environmental record of any governor during his tenure in 
Texas. Texas became number one in air and water pollution and in the release of 
toxic chemicals. In his six years in Austin, he championed a short-term 
pollution-based prosperity, which enriched his political contributors and corporate 
cronies by lowering the quality of life for everyone else. Now President Bush 
is set to do the same to America. After three years, his policies are already 
bearing fruit, diminishing standards of living for millions of Americans.

Thanksgiving! It means so many things. Turkey, giving thanks, turkey, 
football, more turkey, time spent with family eating turkey, reflecting on the 
blessings in our lives and of course Maalox moments from all the turkey.

This most American holiday has so many wonderful traditions, yet many people 
have genuine difficulties during this day. Many of the traditions of 
Thanksgiving surely must be disturbing to certain Liberals. 

Surely this day must cause great offenses to those afflicted with perpetual 
offendeditis. So before we partake in our feasts let us take a somewhat 
sarcastic look at what Thanksgiving might mean to some way out Leftists. 

First off, naturally, must be the animal rights types who surely suffer great 
consternation during Thanksgiving. I mean come on! Thanksgiving is much to do 
with people, whom animal rights types loath, eating animals, which these same 
animal rights types love. 

Now of course no one with any decency supports cruelty to animals but in the 
real world the most important jobs turkeys have is to be on the table in time 
for Thanksgiving. To most people this makes perfect sense. But to a PETA 
member this is blasphemous! 

So every Thanksgiving animal rights types weep and gnash their teeth and 
curse all of us who eat these birds. While the rest of America is trying to 
justify that third piece of pecan pie while trying to stay awake for the Cowboys 
game, the PETA members are munching carrot sticks and crying for their departed 
turkey brothers. Now is this any way to enjoy a holiday? 
Then of course there are the radical feminists who must also surely despise 
this holiday. Think about your typical stone-faced, perpetually angry radical 
feminist and what they must surely suffer on this day.

MOGO Zoo's celebrity resident is now on public display after 30 days in 
quarantine.
Ijuma the giraffe became an instant idol during his road trip from the Sydney 
docks to his new Eurobodalla Shire home last month.
His transporter trailer literally stopped traffic along the Princes Highway, 
with countless motorists and bystanders taking the opportunity to gawk at the 
18-month-old giraffe.
Now visitors to Mogo Zoo will be able to enjoy watching the purebred male 
Rothschild in the open.
Ijuma is gradually being acclimatised to the wide-open spaces and will soon 
be able to roam the African Plain area of Mogo Zoo with the zebra, oryx and 
ostrich.
Head keeper Phil Whelan, who hand fed the giraffe during its eight-day voyage 
from New Zealand, said Ijuma had taken all the changes in his stride.
"He's been fine," Mr Whelan said. 
"He's got a beautiful temperament, if he was a horse you could call him 
bomb-proof."
Mogo Zoo owner Sally Padey said Ijuma was given a clean bill of health from 
quarantine officers this week, signalling the end of a massive operation to 
re-house the giraffe in Australia.
"This has been the biggest thing we have ever done," Mrs Padey said.
"It has cost us $20,000 plus just to get him here, what with shipping, 
quarantine fees etc.
"We really have to say a very big thankyou to the Coachhouse Resort for all 
the help that they gave us in bringing him to Mogo Zoo.
"Over the years, the support that has been shown to us from the businesses in 
Batemans Bay has been truly amazing."
Mrs Padey is smitten with Ijuma's eyes.
"I think if half the models in the world had eyes and lashes like he has they 
would be worth even more squillions," she said. "He just has the most 
beautiful eyes."
And she's expecting him to be big hit with visitors.
"A lot of people have been asking about him," she said, "he created so much 
interest with his trip down here.
"People have been able to catch glimpses of him [in his shed] but now he is 
out on display and we hope to have a female coming for him in the near future."

Cathedral Rocks resembled a row of praying Spanish maidens. Their bowed heads 
were shrouded by mantillas of snow and lichen, draped over tall combs of firs 
and pines.

Half Dome, 2,300 feet taller, stood utterly swathed in white. It looked like 
a cowled Trappist monk, hovering nearby to guide the devotions.

Below these summits, Yosemite Valley lay hushed and still. That was due to 
the muffling effect of winter's first snowfall, which dropped nearly a foot on 
the valley floor, and double and triple that amount at higher elevations.

The valley was also quiet because of a seasonal drop in Yosemite National 
Park visitors. Of its 3.5 million visitors, two-thirds come between May and 
September. Crowds are thickest by summer's end; 585,787 were recorded in August 
2002. They thin out dramatically after the first frost; only 155,554 people came 
last November.

So now, an air of wildness is drifting back down like an ephemeral mist upon 
one of America's most beautiful and popular parks. Amid winter, activities 
such as ranger-led walks don't cease. They become less frequent, but much easier 
to attend and appreciate.

"I can't imagine what this place would even be like, with a lot more people," 
said one guest last week at an interpretive walk. She was one of 16 visitors 
attending.

"Yep," beamed ranger Erik Westerlund. "Perfect, isn't it?"

His topic was Rock and Ice, the forming of Yosemite's monumental creche of 
soaring walls and sculptural spires. Snowbound peaks provided a convincing 
backdrop, as he explained how the Merced River, aided by the great, crystal 
cleavers of glaciers, had hewn at the park's granite over the past million years.</docText>

THE New Jersey black bear hunt scheduled for December is in jeopardy, and if 
what we are hearing is accurate, it looks as if Gov. McGreevey will buckle 
under to pressure from the so-called animal rights groups. 
"The McGreevey administration has time and again displayed its sympathy for 
the anti-hunting cause," said Rob Sexton, U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance Vice 
President for Government Affairs. Sexton explained that all signs point to McGreevey 
siding with anti-hunting activists against wildlife experts, public safety 
concerns and hunters. 
"The governor has created committees to establish wildlife policy and stacked 
them with animal rights advocates," he said. 
McGreevey's Dept. of Environmental Protection commissioner, Bradley Campbell, 
has in recent weeks gone so far as to blame homeowners for incidents with 
nuisance black bears. Campbell has admitted to wanting to take a serious look at 
birth control for the animals, as a means of controlling wildlife populations, 
in order to discourage hunting. 
The N.J. Fish and Game Council approved the black bear hunt in July to 
address concerns about the state's uncontrolled black bear population and the 
problems, including human conflicts with bears, which result from it. The conflicts 
include an incident in May in which a New Jersey toddler was struck on the 
head by a 175-pound female bear. In August, an 18-year-old woman survived a bear 
attack at a park near her home. 
 
Those in favor of the hunt should contact Gov. McGreevey at (609) 292-6000 
and urge him to protect public safety and sportsmen's rights. Ask him to allow 
the black bear hunt to continue as scheduled Dec. 8-13. 
Anti-hunters also filed a lawsuit this week against the N.J. DEP to suspend 
all hunting, fishing and trapping. </docText>

The turkey exploded when I stuck it with the serving fork. My Aunt Rita,
who has a bad valve in her heart, dove under the table, clutching her
blood-thinning pills, as boiling-hot soy-wasabi magma sauce sprayed across
the room.

"It's not so bad!" said my wife, Roni. Our Thanksgiving guests nodded
politely at her Pollyannaish reaction and held their noses as the
sulfurous smell of scorched seitan filled the kitchen. Burning, gassy
blobs of cranberry-tofu stuffing pockmarked the chairs, table, and linens.
(I took rounds in the chest, but was protected by my polyester-blend
shirt.) The label of the cheap South African zinfandel my Dad bought
peeled off and slid into the faux chicken pate, creating a
burning-oil-slick texture in the curiously untouched chafing dish. The
sweet-and-sour soy meatballs sat in small round heaps, also untouched,
like leftover ordnance.

The kids pretended to be wounded by soy shrapnel and draped themselves in
dying poses across the furniture. Last year was our first vegetarian
Thanksgiving, and both the Pilgrims and the Indians were unhappy.
...
"I saw something on CNN about fake boobs collapsing," said my Dad.
Although this non sequitur was inappropriate, given the presence of A. and
our five-year-old triplets, he did hit upon a strange cultural synthesis
between fake meat, the fixation on female breasts, and the bland, dry,
genetically mutated turkeys that dominate our holidays. What was it about
breasts, real or pretend, that crossed so many cultural boundaries?

The pseudo turkey was a noble experiment that veered out of control.
...
So the vegetarian Thanksgiving was Roni's attempt to demonstrate our pride
in A.'s quiet commitment to not eating murdered meals. Unfortunately, like
most heroic examples, his was impractical given the context of crazed
holiday expectations. Even I craved a slice of dry, throat-catching
turkey, covered in dark gravy cooked from animal bits best left to scavengers.

This year, Roni is cooking a 20-pound organic turkey, chicken-liver pate,
and sausage stuffing. A. and our vegetarian city friends will dine on a
brand-new product, Tofurkey. It actually looks tasty. That's the curious
thing about our culture ? the fake often replaces the real.

This Christmas, why not cuddle up with a furry friend while giving the gift 
of life to an endangered species? 
World Wildlife Federation Canada has come up with an unusual gift idea: For 
$40 you can "adopt" a living tiger, one of the world's most endangered species. 
More than 95 per cent of the world's tigers have been lost from the wild, 
according to WWF Canada statistics. The 5,000 tigers still in existence have the 
odds of survival stacked against them as the result of illegal hunting and 
destruction of their habitat. 
WWF Canada is asking for help in its preservation efforts, which have already 
helped double the Bengal tiger population and helped the Siberian tiger 
population grow from just 40 in the 1940s to more than 350 today. 
As proud "parents," your adoption kit includes an acknowledgement of your 
gift, which will help fund WWF Canada efforts to put an end to illegal hunting 
and protect tiger habitats. 
You'll also receive a personalized adoption certificate, a $30 tax receipt 
and a plush, tiger cub toy from the Russ toy company. 
A $10 courier charge may apply. Order online at the WWF's Web site or call 
1-866-2-SAVE-ME (272-8363). 
WWF Canada also has similar adoption programs for polar bears, dolphins and 
wolves, with the adoption kits featuring plush toy versions of these endangered 
species.</docText>

Hefty fines and other tougher penalties await Marlborough dog owners who 
breach new dog control laws which come into force on Monday. 

Fines of up to $1000 are a feature of the new laws while owners of "menacing" 
dog breeds will need to have them muzzled in public. 
From next week the Marlborough District Council will be enforcing higher 
penalties, including $300 fines for roaming dogs and a $500 fine for people not 
picking up after their dog has pooped in public. 
Council reserves and amenities supervisor Russell Montgomery said the council 
had lobbied hard to have the fines reduced from $500 to $300 for impoundment 
of dogs as well as the removal of "draconian" laws requiring people to fence 
off accessways to their properties. 
He said the laws were now something they could work with but he would have 
liked to see fines a little lower because they would be simply unaffordable for 
many people. 
He said it was now important that dogs had their tags attached because they 
would be impounded otherwise. 
Responsible owners had nothing to fear from the new laws but Mr Montgomery 
said irresponsible people would have to "wake up to the new rules" or face the 
extra expense. 
Blenheim dog owner Karen Middlemiss said she enjoyed walking her dog along 
the Taylor River and did not see any problems with the new laws. She was aware 
of the need to carry a dog lead but said most people she met on her walks would 
carry one anyway if they did not trust their dog to "socialise". 
"We have never had a problem with other dogs down there." 
She said the doggy-do bags provided by the council in designated walking 
areas were good and had made a difference to the state of the walking areas. </docText>

It's 6:15 a.m., Nov. 20, and cold -- or at least, as cold as November 
mornings in Orlando get. The temperature has dipped into the low 50s, and we're 
standing in the parking lot of the University of Central Florida Arena, anxiously 
awaiting the warmth of a chartered bus due here 45 minutes ago. With me is a 
writer from the Central Florida Future, about 35 student activists from the 
school's campus.Peace.ACTION group and two older women sporting Dennis Kucinich 
T-shirts.
"Lousy union labor!" one student yells, a reference to the missing bus. He's 
shot a look of remonstration, and recants: "I'm just joshing." 
We're not the only ones growing impatient. Channel 13 sent a reporter out to 
film the students getting on the bus, and she's now behind schedule. While we 
wait, ACTION leader Emily Ruff passes around a release form that includes a 
space for next of kin. 
"What's it for?" one student asks. 
"If you get arrested," Ruff responds. 
"Not if, when," another student chimes in, and the group laughs. 
Ruff instructs us to break into groups of two or three -- the buddy system -- 
and gives us gauze, bandages and latex gloves. One student activist is 
commended for having a poster that's not attached to a carrying stick: Sticks can be 
considered weapons, I'm told, and where we're going, having such a weapon 
could get you beaten or tear-gassed. Another student uses red tape to fashion a

Koryaksky volcano towers over the city of Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka 
Peninsula, where wildlife authorities wrestle with the pervasive poaching industry.



Charlie Russell closed up his cabin at 
Kambalnoye Lake, on the remote tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia's Far East, 
and said goodbye for the winter to the bears he had studied for seven years. 
There were 20 in all. Among them: Brandy, who often left her three cubs with 
Russell for baby-sitting while she went fishing. Walnut, a young male. 
Biscuit, whom Russell had raised as a cub and who, pregnant with her own offspring, 
would sometimes come bounding to greet him when he landed his plane, brushing 
against his leg or nibbling his boot. 
Russell left last November for his home in Canada, confident the bears soon 
would be safe in their snow-shrouded slumber. He returned, as usual, in spring. 
But instead of finding Biscuit emerging with blinking cubs from her den, all 
he found was stillness. 
Biscuit did not appear. Nor did Walnut or Brandy or any of the bears. Russell 
searched for two months without finding a trace of any of them. What he did 
find, when he opened his cabin, was a bear's gallbladder, hung from a nail on 
the wall. 
What had happened during those weeks before impenetrable drifts of snow 
settled over the valley, before the bears would have lumbered off to the safety of 
their dens? Who left the gruesome artifact on the wall, and was it an 
oversight or a message? And the question that haunts Russell most of all: Did Biscuit 
walk up to greet her killers? </docText>

There is nothing I can do; we're on the point of no return. Sebastian's 
instructions resonate in my mind: "If you fall, whatever happens, you mustn't let 
go of the sled." So here I am being dragged along face down in the snow, deep 
in the Yukon wilderness.


The trail is narrow and my team of dogs is weaving around the trees without 
any concern for its fallen musher. The sky is blue, the sun is shining and 
everything is coated in snow, including me. The silence is shattered by my muffled 
laughter.
"Whooooooa"! The team comes to a halt. I lie there, still hanging on while 
trying to locate the sled's anchor. A few inches away I can see the beautiful 
detail of peeling bark and snow crystals at the base of an aspen tree. Staring 
at this tiny detail, the scale of this vast landscape seems unimaginable.
Space, space and more space - the Yukon lies between Alaska (to the west) and 
the vast expanse of the Canadian Arctic to the east. It's a two-hour flight 
north from Vancouver to the capital Whitehorse. It has a population of 31,000 
(70 per cent of whom live in Whitehorse), but it's also home to 185,000 
caribou, 50,000 moose and 17,000 bears.
The Yukon is also an awe-inspiring playground for adventurous types, though 
the range of activities includes plenty that are far from gung-ho. In winter, 
one of the best ways to explore is to use the network of dogsled and snowmobile 
trails, many of which follow the traditional trapping lines of the indigenous 
people.

Fossil bones record the history of the human form, but they say little about 
behavior. A richer source of the way human social behavior evolved may be 
chimpanzees, with whom people shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 or 6 
million years ago. From knowledge of chimp behavior, biologists can plausibly infer 
the social behavior of the shared human-chimp ancestor, and from that they 
can reconstruct the evolutionary history of human social behavior. 
.
Such reconstructions are subject to much uncertainty and debate, especially 
when they imply a genetic basis of human behaviors like living in communities 
based on male kinship or conducting lethal campaigns against neighbors. But the 
goal is to shed light on the full sweep of human social behavior, tracing its 
evolution from an apelike community with separate male and female hierarchies 
5 million years ago to the family-based societies of today. 
.
A principal assumption is that chimps, unlike people, have changed little and 
so their social behavior is a good guide to that of the common ancestor. One 
support for this idea is that the earliest fossils on the human side after the 
split are very chimplike. Another is that the chimps of western and eastern 
Africa are hard to tell apart, despite 1.5 million years of separate evolution. 
.
After 40 years of arduous study, biologists have put together a coherent, 
though not yet complete, picture of chimpanzee societies. From observations at 
several sites in Africa, there is an "emerging consensus regarding chimpanzee 
social structure, territory characteristics and intergroup interactions," two 
primatologists, Michael Wilson of the University of Minnesota and Richard 
Wrangham of Harvard, write in The Annual Review of Anthropology. 
.
Chimps are not easy to observe. It can take five years for them to get used 
to watchers. They must be followed, through hilly country, for 15 hours at a 
stretch. They can be dangerous. Humphrey, a male chimp at the Gombe National 
Park in Tanzania, nearly killed Wrangham by hurling a large rock at his head. "He 
was just showing off," Wrangham says indulgently. A female chimpanzee at 
Mahale, also in Tanzania, attacked and severely wounded two researchers she 
considered to be allies of males that had killed her infant. 
.
A major surprise has been that chimps turn out to live in territories whose 
borders are aggressively defended by roving parties of males. Jane Goodall, who 
pioneered long-term studies of chimps at Gombe, at first believed she was 
watching a single peaceful community. But as researchers started to follow 
animals throughout the day and watch their interaction with others, they found that 
groups of male chimps went out on border patrols, ready to attack and kill the 
males of neighboring communities. 
.
The males in each community are related to one another because they spend 
their lives where they were born, whereas the females usually migrate to 
neighboring communities soon after reaching puberty, a practice that avoids 
inbreeding. This patrilocal system, of a community based on male kin bonding, is 
unusual, but familiar to anthropologists because it is practiced by most 
hunter-gatherer societies. 
.
The males' operational strategy seems to be to defend a territory as large as 
possible so as to improve the community's food supply, which is principally 
fruit, and thereby their reproductive success. Anne Pusey of the University of 
Minnesota has found that the larger the female chimp's home feeding area, the 
shorter the interval between births. 
.
In two known cases, a chimp community has wiped out all of a neighbor's 
males. Though the females may be absorbed into the victor's community, the goal 
seems to be getting rid of a rival rather than capturing females, since males 
often attack strange females. 
.
Very few species live in male-kin-bonded communities with female dispersal. 
And only two practice lethal raids into neighbors' territory to kill off 
vulnerable enemies. "This suite of behaviors in known only among chimpanzees and 
humans," Wrangham and Dale Peterson write in their book, "Demonic Males." 
.
Many chimp behaviors are ones people can recognize. Much of their body 
language - a mother holding her baby, the expression of an orphaned infant - is 
instantly readable. About 19 varieties of tool use by chimps have been noted, 
though each community has its own cultural subset. Chimps dose themselves with 
medicinal plants when they are sick. But where they differ most from human 
societies is in their sexual arrangements. 
.
Males and females do not associate in families but in separate hierarchies. 
Males make females defer to them, with violence whenever necessary, and every 
female is subordinate to every male. A female chimp advertises her fertile 
period with a visible swelling and is then so pestered by males that she may get 
to eat only at night. But the great advantage of mating with every male in the 
community in a public orgy is that it confuses paternity, significant 
insurance given that males are liable to kill infants they know are not their own. 
.
Males sometimes get females to leave the group and give them exclusive 
matings during a cycle. These consortships are sometimes forced on the female, who 
may recognize the risk to any infant conceived by a known father. 
.
An intriguing variation on the chimpanzee social system is that of bonobos, 
which split from chimps about 1.8 million years ago. With bonobos, who live 
south of the Congo River, the female hierarchy is dominant, and males do not 
patrol the borders to kill neighbors. Though bonobos are almost as aggressive as 
chimps, they have developed a potent reconciliation technique - the use of sex 
on any and all occasions, between all ages and sexes, to abate tension and 
make nice. 
.
Assuming the common ancestor of people and chimps had social behavior that 
was essentially chimplike, how much of that behavior has been inherited by 
people? The unusual behavioral suite of male kin bonding and lethal territorial 
aggression may look as if it has been inherited with little change. Among the 
Yanomamo, a South American tribe, the number of males who die from aggression is 
about 30 percent, the same rate found among Gombe chimps. 
.
Not everyone believes that chimp social behavior is a good guide to human 
evolution. "All these things are suggestive and point tantalizingly to things we 
want to know," said Ian Tattersall, a paleoanthropologist at the American 
Museum of Natural History. "We just have to bear in mind that none of this is 
demonstrable in any highly convincing way." 
.
But Robert Foley, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of 
Cambridge in England, says a lot can be learned from ape sociality about the 
evolution of human social institutions. A community size of 80 to 100 people, typical 
among chimps and hunter-gatherers, is one feature inherited from the common 
ancestor. Another is a society formed on the basis of male kin bonding.

An animal welfare group on Wednesday sought a court order to prevent wolves 
from being shot from airplanes as part of a state-sponsored predator control 
program. 
The Connecticut-based group Friends of Animals, along with seven Alaska 
plaintiffs, sought the temporary restraining order after the state issued three 
permits allowing pilot-and-hunter teams to shoot wolves in the McGrath area of 
Alaska's Interior. 
Superior Court Judge Sharon L. Gleason was expected to decide by the end of 
the day whether to issue the temporary restraining order. The judge also was 
scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether to issue a preliminary injunction 
sought by Friends of Animals to stop the program. 
If that effort fails, the group will call for a tourism boycott of Alaska as 
they did a decade ago when 53 demonstrations called "howl-ins" were held at 51 
cities nationwide, said Friends of Animals president Priscilla Feral. 
"Basically, it is putting the economic screws to the Murkowski 
administration," Feral said of the threatened tourism boycott. 
The first tourism boycott and strong national opposition resulted in former 
Gov. Walter J. Hickel imposing a moratorium on wolf control in 1992. Former 
Gov. Tony Knowles then suspended state-sanctioned wolf killing shortly after 
gaining office in 1994. Current Gov. Frank Murkowski, who took office in December, 
favors lethal wolf control. 
The predator control program for the McGrath area is intended to reduce the 
number of wolves near the town and increase the number of moose calves so that 
there will be more moose for McGrath area residents to eat. </docText>

AN organisation which uses dogs and cats as a way of comforting elderly and 
disabled people is calling for more volunteers.
Pets As Therapy was launched in 1983 when founder-member Lesley Scott-Ordish 
decided to help people who had become depressed by being institutionalised in 
care homes and hospitals.
Lena Hanen, director of the South of England branch of PAT, explained: "We 
are a national charity which has around 3,000 to 4,000 volunteers, visiting in 
the region of 100,000 establishments each week.
"Our aim is simple. Where people do not have access to pets, whether that be 
in care homes or elderly people on their own at home, our volunteers can visit 
them with their pets.
"It is instinctive in animals to give love to people, and they cannot care 
less whether those people are in wheelchairs or are elderly.
"The dogs and cats can be a real help to those people as the animals, and 
their owners, are sometimes the only visitors they get, apart from their carers.
"Just seeing a dog or cat can be enough to bring some people out of an 
otherwise withdrawn state."
PAT also takes dogs into schools and prisons where volunteers help teach 
responsible ownership.
Waltham Forest volunteer Carole Heed said: "The animals are very much 
welcomed by the people being visited as many of them have been unable to have their 
pets with them. Also, they will interact with an animal but may not communicate 
with other people. They can be encouraged to use their limbs to stroke them 
or take them for short walks and it has been proved that stroking reduces 
anxiety."</docText>

Francisco and Sheila were ideal parents. They raised 25 babies, taught them 
good survival skills, and sent many of them off to live on their own.

Francisco and Sheila were Mexican grey wolves, or lobos, part of a breeding 
programme in Eureka, 32km south-west of St Louis. Although captive themselves, 
Francisco and Sheila taught their pups such good wolf traits that many are 
thriving in the wild.

Francisco and Sheila were pioneers in a US federal programme to restore the 
endangered Mexican grey wolf, the rarest and most genetically distinct 
subspecies of grey wolf in North America. After more than a century of assault by 
humans, by the 1970s its population had dwindled to a handful in its natural range 
in Mexico and the south-west of America.

Nine of Francisco and Sheila's offspring were among the first 11 captive-born 
Mexican grey wolves released in 1998. Both parent wolves have since died - 
Francisco at age 14 in December, Sheila at age 16 in June 2000 - but they lived, 
as captive wolves often do, roughly twice as long as wolves in the wild. 
Today, the Wild Canid Survival &amp; Research Centre in Eureka estimates that 98% of 
Mexican wolves released in
the federal programme are descendants of the prolific lobo pair.

"They're true heroes," says Kim Bishop-Scott, assistant director of the 
centre. "So many of (their) offspring actually made it into the wild. They 
sacrificed their freedom for future generations."</docText>

Long-shot candidate says he wants to bring spiritual principles to governance.
...
Dennis Kucinich was expounding on his proposals for a
hasty exit from Iraq and a 15 percent cut in defense spending when a
member of Central Ohioans for Peace asked about something far deeper.

With the 57-year-old Cleveland congressman headed for a fund-raiser
sponsored by the Natural Law Party, which espouses the pantheistic message
of oneness and unity, the skeptical peace activist asked, "I wonder if you
feel sure of the dangers others see in aligning yourself with them?"

Kucinich answered by asking everyone to take a dollar bill out of their
pocket and to look closely at the eye at the apex of the pyramid on the
Great Seal.

"Here on the Great Seal of the United States we see an expression of
spiritual principles," Kucinich said. "So I think what we are here to do
is bring spiritual principles into the material world."
...
His hair is typically mussed. He appears to be swimming in his suits,
perhaps because his vegan diet keeps him rail thin. And his ears seem a
bit too large for his boyish face. It is hardly the look of political
polish that personal wealth has bought some of the other contenders for
the seat he seeks.
...
"Is he electable?" said Ohio State University political science professor
Herb Weisberg. "Not unless he's away from Washington, D.C., on a day that
a nuclear attack wipes out everyone else in government -- and even then he
would be carrying the wrong message to win."
...
It was on that journey that Kucinich met actress Shirley MacLaine, from
whom he borrowed a reported $20,000 that still shows up as unpaid on his
congressional financial disclosure report. He also met other
spiritualists, vegans and new-age crusaders who remain among his core
supporters.

Two decades after their son?s death, a York County family still worries about 
the boy who shot him. 
Don and Anne Coe's son, Roger Coe, was killed more than two decades ago when 
a 12-year-old boy slipped on some underbrush and shot him through the heart. A 
quarter of Pennsylvania's hunting accidents are caused by hunters under the 
age of 18.
More than 25 years ago, Don Coe received one of the worst phone calls of his 
life. 
His daughter-in-law?s pastor called to inform him that his youngest son had 
died. 
?It?s a thing you never forget,? he said. 
Coe?s son, Roger, a young minister, a husband and brand-new father of a baby 
girl, had been killed in a hunting accident in Juniata County. A 12-year-old 
boy in his hunting party carried the gun that killed him. 
?The boy slipped and fell,? Don Coe said. ?His gun went off and shot our son 
through the heart. He died instantly. Both safeties were off.? 
The circumstances surrounding Roger Coe?s accident did not surprise Eric 
Nuse, executive vice president of the International Hunter Education Association. 
About a quarter of hunting accidents nationally and in Canada involve hunters 
under the age of 19. 
?I think the main thing is,? Nuse said, ?they?re less experienced.? 
In some studies, he said, hunters between the ages of 12 and 16, when 
accompanied by an adult and hunting small game, were actually the safest group. 
?That kind of points to the strength or value of having a good mentor with a 
junior hunter,? he said. 
Two things have to go wrong, Nuse said, before any hunter becomes injured in 
an accident: someone has to point the muzzle of their weapon in the wrong 
direction and the safety must not be engaged. 
?In my experience, that?s where a lot of the youth injuries occur,? he said. 
?Careless handling.? </docText>

A rise in ecoterrorism is prompting federal and state lawmakers to craft laws 
aimed specifically at radical environmental and animal-rights activists. 
For those wanting to crack down on people who use 
arson and threats of personal violence to force better treatment of animals 
and nature, tougher legal penalties are logical. But to civil libertarians, and 
especially to law-abiding activists, this trend is an attempt to stifle 
legitimate political dissent, including peaceful civil disobedience. That it comes 
at a time of political stress over the war in Iraq, sometimes rough protests 
against international trade agreements, and calls to patriotism is not lost on 
either side. 


Initially, acts of "monkey wrenching" amounted to little more than vandalism 
aimed at such targets as logging equipment and mink farms. In the 1990s, that 
escalated to major arson and bombings. Meanwhile, the range of targets in 
recent months has expanded to include biotechnology firms, SUV dealers, housing 
developments, Wal-Mart stores, and a bottled water plant. 
According to the FBI, there have been some 600 acts of ecoterrorism in the 
United States with property losses totaling nearly $50 million. Speaking of 
recent attacks on biotech firms, Phil Celestini, head of the FBI's domestic 
terrorism unit in Washington, told the Associated Press, "We've seen a drastic 
escalation in the use of violent tactics in the past year." </docText>

Before the Swedes banned the use of steel-jaw leghold traps, they held a 
fox-trapping campaign. Some of the foxes knocked out as many as 18 teeth as they 
frantically lashed out trying to escape. A few gnawed off their own legs to 
break free. Of the 645 trapped foxes, 514 were seriously injured. 
The fur trim on the hood of your parka could be the bloody corpse of a 
trapped fox. Or it could be faux fur. Which would you rather wear next to your face? 
Friday was "Fur Free Friday," since 1986 a day of protest against 
slaughtering animals for their fur. A Voice for Animals, a San Antonio advocacy group, 
staged a protest on Broadway. 
Here in South-Central Texas, fur is absurd. It's not as if some local Dr. 
Zhivago has to bundle his Lara in a mound of mink blankets for the trek across 
the snow drifts to Seguin. This isn't Chicago, let alone the steppes of Russia. 
But all of us, even if we live in the sunny South, should care about the 
inhumane way animals are raised, trapped and killed for their fur. 
Before I return to leghold traps, let's visit a fur ranch. Yes, they call 
them ranches! Disabuse yourself of any romantic notions of longhorn mink at home 
on the range, herded by little minkboys tossing tiny lariats. 
The male mink is a traveling man, with a range of about 25 miles, taking 
about a week to make a circuit of his turf. They are semi-aquatic mammals who hang 
out around lakes, creeks and marshes. A male grows to be 20 to 30 inches 
long. 
In a fur ranch, the mink will be kept in a cage, typically 10 inches wide by 
24 inches long. No wiggle room. No water to frolic in, no well-worn paths to 
cruise. Many experience psychological trauma with symptoms such as ulcers and 
cannibalism. 
When it's time for the kill, most mink are murdered by poison gas, lethal 
injection or breaking their little necks. They fare better than farmed foxes, 
which are most commonly killed by anal electrocution. 
To kill a chinchilla, ranchers hook one metal clamp to the ear and another to 
the genitalia, then zap electricity through the circuit. Chinchillas are 
small. A hundred of them are slaughtered to make a full-length fur coat. 
And people want to wear that next to their own skin? Ugh!</docText>

It's holiday shopping time. Our mailboxes and newspapers are filled with low 
prices on gifts we just cannot pass up. Your task this year is to make sure 
the gifts you give, along with their packaging, are green.

When we buy gifts, we need to look at their life and usefulness. Would we 
want to hang onto a gift for 50 years?

Americans produce 25 percent more trash between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
About 40 percent of holiday gifts received are on their way to the landfill 
within a month of the holidays. So take a minute and think green.

Electronics are generally cheaper the weeks before Christmas. The big 
question is what to do with the old electronic items. Before leaving office, Gov. 
Davis finally signed into law Senate Bill 20, which is the electronics recycling 
bill. Unfortunately, it will initially cover only TV and computer monitors, 
and those recycling programs won't kick in until late next year.

The good news is that Vallejo Garbage Service (VGS) will have an electronics 
recycling event in late spring 2004. In the interim, VGS will pick up TV and 
computer monitors for a fee or you can safely store your old devices until the 
event.

Shopping locally for your holiday gifts saves energy and time and keeps tax 
money in our city's coffers. Check out the new stores downtown when you go to 
Saturday's farmers market. Walk up Marin Street to the Museum Bookstore for 
local books or gift memberships and continue on to the Vallejo Artists Guild 
Gallery for paintings from local artists.

On that same theme, make a donation in a friend's name to the local Friends 
of Animals or Humane Society. This gift will help abandoned dogs and cats and 
is a waste-free gift for the receiver.</docText>

It's beyond serious dispute that the Bush White House is dismantling 30 years 
of bipartisan environmental progress, in defiance of law, scientific 
understanding, popular sentiment and common sense.

The Bush administration's horrific environmental reputation isn't just a bad 
rap. The environmental gains Americans have enjoyed for years prove that 
vigorous protection of our natural resources is both effective and consistent with 
economic prosperity. 

The administration's destructive rollbacks threaten decades of progress, and 
they have already begun to take their toll. After three years of President 
Bush's policies, US waterways are getting dirtier, according to the Environmental 
Protection Agency, EPA, for the first time since passage of the Clean Water 
Act. 

Administration policies have driven automobile fuel efficiencies to their 
lowest levels in decades. Superfund clean-ups for millions of Americans in 
tainted communities have been halted because the White House is allowing polluters 
to escape replenishing the bankrupt fund.</docText>

Workers are putting bridge supports in place as they extend Dove Road from 
Dove Loop Road to North Main Street in Grapevine.

GRAPEVINE - The gruff cacophony of construction equipment at Dove Road in 
Grapevine soon heralded other unfamiliar noises for Grapevine resident Lyn Murphy.
Growls. Snarls. Howls.
"I heard this clang, clang, clang and rushed outside," said Murphy, who lives 
about a block away from a portion of the $6.2 million Dove Road expansion 
project. "There were these baby raccoons washing their faces in the pool, and 
their mama was making all the noise trying to get into my barbecue."
Since the road construction began along the undeveloped land, raccoons are 
not the only visitors, she said. Murphy and some neighbors have seen an increase 
in other nocturnal callers, such as foxes and coyotes.
And she blames the road construction.
Dove Road is being extended from Dove Loop Road to North Main Street. The 
much-needed east-west main road will run through what is now a heavily wooded 
area, including almost 4 acres controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers, city 
officials said. The 16-month project is scheduled for completion by late 2004.
Murphy has not taken her concerns to city officials yet, but they probably 
would not be surprised. City engineers went to considerable effort to ensure 
that as little of the natural area is affected as possible, but some animals are 
going to be displaced with any construction project, city officials said.</docText>

PLAGUE OF ESCAPEES Divers in July found about 500 foreign Atlantics among 
native coho in a tributary of the Chehalis River, scarcely 50 miles from the West 
Coast's premier river, the Columbia. The fish got loose from a fish hatchery 
operated by Cypress Island, a Norwegian-owned company operating salmon farms 
in Puget Sound. 
More than three months passed before authorities tried to corral the aliens. 
About 400 remain on the lam. 
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife records show 10 years of escapes 
from the hatchery. Its operation is "pretty slipshod," said Greg Cloud, permit 
manager for the Washington Department of Ecology. 
Hatchery manager Dan Rotter said repeated vandalism of fish screens may have 
allowed the escapes and acknowledged he has not "kept close enough watch on 
that." The company has spent $50,000 rebuilding its screens and installing 
security fences, he said. 
More than 1 million Atlantics have escaped farm pens in Northwest waters, 
some spawning in rivers on Vancouver Island. They have turned up in Washington's 
Dungeness and Nisqually rivers and in the Bering Sea -- 1,000 miles from the 
nearest farm. Fishermen have caught them in Alaska's Copper River, revered for 
native runs with deep rosy flesh. 
Ron Ginetz, chief of aquaculture for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, wrote in an internal 1991 memo that "it is only a matter of time 
before we discover that Atlantics are gaining a foothold in B.C. or in Washington 
state." 
Ginetz now works for the British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association and says 
he no longer thinks Atlantics will take hold in the Pacific. It's a foreign 
environment for them, he says. Millions of fry were introduced in Canada and 
Washington decades ago to establish them as game fish, without success. 
But now Pacific salmon are much weaker, and grown Atlantics get loose year 
after year. Should they colonize the Pacific coast, they could compete with 
natives and undermine costly recovery programs. 
DEPLETING THE OCEAN 
FOR FEED Like wolves or lions, salmon feed on flesh. On farms, they swallow 
it in pellets made from ground, cooked and compressed fish such as menhaden and 
jack mackerel. But salmon are so voracious it takes three or more pounds of 
raw feed fish to raise each pound of fillets sold in the supermarket. That 
leaves oceans with a net loss of life. 
"We're taking food away not only from salmon in the wild, but also from other 
predaceous fish, marine mammals and seabirds," says Jane Lubchenco, an Oregon 
State University marine biologist who advises world leaders on ocean health. 
"What we're doing is going into a food web, tearing out the middle and acting 
surprised when the top comes crashing down." 
Not only Norway is swarming with escaped Atlantic salmon. They are also 
swimming free in Oregon's back yard. </docText>

Being more interested in consuming chard than counting chads, vegetarians
did not play a prominent role in the last presidential election. Unless
something changes quickly, history seems destined to repeat in Campaign '04.

Though vegans now have one of their own as a candidate, Democratic U.S.
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, there is scant evidence they are rallying
behind him.

Perhaps the reason is they are unaccustomed to having a vegetarian aspire
to the White House. "I haven't carefully researched it, but I'm pretty
sure the congressman would be the first vegan president," Kucinich
spokesman David Swanson said.

Americans don't seem to want a president who spends much time perusing the
parsley in the produce aisle. Our nation historically has preferred
carnivores for their commanders in chief. 
...
"Many vegetarian organizations, including ours, are nonprofit, tax-exempt
organizations that have to work within the confines of not supporting
political candidates," explained Brian Graf of the North American
Vegetarian Society in Dolgeville, N.Y.

Vegetarian groups have been politically inert since the dawn of time, but
they need to quickly become a force if Kucinich is to have a chance. They
should funnel money to a quasi-independent political action committee,
drum up some donations and create a slick new slogan to publicize their
political prowess.

"You Can't Beet Vegan Voters," maybe? </docText>

In her 2002 book "Fashion Victim," Michelle Lee describes the cyclical nature 
of trends, with fur as a prime example. The ?80s were all about glamour and 
excess, and the fur industry in the U.S. saw enormous sales. 
The high was $2.3 billion in 1987. Yes, that?s billion with a "b." In one 
year. In the U.S. alone. 
But the early ?90s brought a new look to the fashion world. This was the era 
of Kurt Cobain, flannel shirts and Doc Martens. And though Tom Ford of Gucci 
might not have sent his models down the runway in dirty T-shirts and combat 
boots, the high fashion houses did begin to shy away from conspicuous consumption 
and all the shoulder pads, embroidery and yes, fur, that that implies. Fur 
sales bottomed out below the $1 billion mark in 1991. 
In the late ?90s, however, fur made a surprising comeback. Fur collars and 
coats were everywhere in 2000, from the runways of Paris (with Prada?s 
rabbit-fur "tippet" notably leading the way) to the discount stores of New Jersey. 
With the visible example of Naomi Campbell, those who had considered 
themselves anti-fur were suddenly torn between fashion and politics. The supermodel 
had long been a spokesperson for PETA when, in 1997, she pranced down the Fendi 
runway in an oversized Russian sable coat. The media enjoyed poking fun at her 
"brazen duplicity," but she wasn?t alone in her fickleness. </docText>

Our son, Sam, and his fianc?e, Jennifer Felt, negotiated nine hours of
traffic last week driving up from D.C. for Thanksgiving, but for Jen the
journey was decidedly longer and viscerally more distressing. On the
occasion of a feast, she came fresh from the slaughter.

She works for the Humane Society International, the global arm of the
Humane Society of the United States. Headquarters are in the nation's
capital. She is program manager for all of Latin America and the Caribbean.

In the two years she's worked for the privately funded organization, it's
simpler to name the few countries to which she has not been sent: Ecuador,
Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. She deals with four principal concerns:
Illegal trade of wildlife; humane methods of stray/street animal control;
working equine welfare, and the economic benefits of humane slaughter.
...
On Tuesday, she was taken to the slaughterhouse outside London, met with a
veterinarian and inspectors on the premises and changed into rubber boots,
two pair of overalls, a hair net and hard hat. She was not given gloves or
goggles. She'd been told she'd kill a minimum of three steers.
...
?Everyone tried to calm me,? she said. ?You just want to do it right.
Otherwise the animal would suffer.? She did it right. That's what the head
slaughterer told her after the first shot. ?I just wanted to get it over
with,? she said. ?I told myself that by doing this I was helping alleviate
the suffering of thousands of animals.?</docText>

- A burgeoning livestock industry in North Dakota could be a key to future 
economic development, however, one official suggests residents of the state are 
taking the wrong approach when it comes to this industry.

The state has lost thousands of dairy farms in the past 15 years and protests 
over recent large-scale hog developments in Towner and Cavalier counties 
could harm small-town economic development in the long term, according to Ward 
County Extension Agent Mike Rose. 

As a result, he created a 10-minute slide presentation that is designed to 
show why large livestock operations could be an economic shot in the arm for 
North Dakota. 

The program, which Rose has shown at least six times in the Minot area, is 
titled "Not In My Back Yard." It focuses on the advantages of livestock, and 
gives statistics to clarify his remarks.

"I put this together to give to non-ag audiences and provoke thought and 
questions," Rose said. "The whole idea is to provoke a thought about this."</docText>

Lynn Strachan, 21, of Ionia County, Mich. hopes to have a deer in her sights. 
Since 1970, hunting accidents have dropped dramatically due to the 
requirement of hunter safety classes for first-time license buyers.
Everyone, it seems, enjoys the sight of a white-tailed deer. It is perhaps 
one of the most beautiful of all creatures. The deer appears in more art and 
photographic work than any other wild mammal. Whether it is from a hiking trail 
or from an automobile, the sight of the whitetail is always a moving experience 
that leaves a lasting impression. 
This year, thousands will take to the woods in hopes to secure a trophy buck. 
And as in every other year there will be some who will protest the tradition. 
The fact will remain, however, that the herd is growing and this winter, 
thousands of deer will die in the competition to survive once again. It is an 
exciting time for those who hunt and a time for anger for those who do not. 
Nevertheless, state fish and game biologists have done a superb job at managing the 
herd and keeping the deer hunger and starvation level at a minimum.

For game wardens in Texas, the fight against animal exploitation and poaching 
stretches from rural areas well into cities such as Dallas and Fort Worth.
Fewer than 500 wardens are charged with protecting animals on 262,017 square 
miles of land and more than 3 million surface acres of water. For these cases, 
Operation Game Thief is the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's answer to 
Crime Stoppers.
The program, which offers rewards of up to $1,000 for information leading to 
arrests and convictions, protects wildlife -- even in the Metroplex -- said 
Maj. Butch Shoop, who is in charge of the department's Fort Worth office.
"We get lots of calls regarding threatened animals, unprotected birds and 
even off-the-wall stuff like alligators," Shoop said.
The program, created in 1981, has paid more than $140,000 in rewards, 
officials said.
The anonymous reports go directly to a 24-hour dispatcher, and the 
information is relayed to a game warden, said L.D. "Buddy" Turner, director of Operation 
Game Thief.
Dispatchers receive about 1,800 calls a year, department statistics show.
Authorities have filed more than 8,000 criminal cases through the program, 
officials said. More than $1 million in fines have been levied.</docText>

the children's furry friend in a gallon jar. Then she lights an off-brand
cigarette shoved into the top of an empty dish-soap bottle. She squeezes
the bottle, the cigarette tip glows red, and smoke wafts into the jar for
maybe half a minute.

The hamster winces and rubs her tiny eyes. Wheeler rescues the rodent and
asks her students in Classroom 139: What does this tell us about smoking?

She's done the demonstration for five or six years in front of 60 or so
students each year. No one ever complained.

Then a Sunnyvale mom tipped off People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
...
Having heard that this year's demonstration was scheduled for last week,
Magee-Cain decided something should be done. She e-mailed PETA.
...
On Nov. 19 at 1 p.m., PETA faxed Sunnyvale principal David Greer.

At 3 p.m., PETA left him a voice mail.

At 5 p.m., PETA posted on its Web site an update marked "Urgent!" A
Sunnyvale teacher, the item read, is "planning to conduct a cruel
classroom experiment in which a hamster is placed in a clear container
without ventilation and smoke is pumped into the chamber."
...
The National Science Teachers Association encourages teachers to have
animals in the classroom: They invigorate textbook lessons with real life.

Willie F. Ivory hasn't had a dog in years.
Doesn't matter.
He's still donating his time as a construction manager to give homeless 
pooches new digs in the Fine-Soffer Adoption Center for the Humane Society of 
Greater Miami in North Miami.
''When you see those stray animals and they are so lost . . .,'' his voice 
trails off before he resumes forcefully, ``they need someone to care for them 
and get them sheltered.''
Ivory, 61, a certified general contractor and construction manager for 
Turnberry Associates, counts himself as that someone -- just as he has for a North 
Miami blind man needing his home renovated, a disabled Perrine couple needing 
their home painted inside and out, even his New Birth Baptist congregation 
needing an overseer to build their 56,000-square-foot megachurch.
For the latter, Ivory estimates he saved the church $1.5 million to $2 
million by waiving his usual fees as general contractor. That's in addition to the 
10 percent of his income he tithes to New Birth every year.
''To me, that's not negotiable,'' he says of his tithe.
Ivory chairs the 32-member regional board of the South Florida Workforce, an 
agency that helps 200,000 people a year in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties find 
jobs. He also is co-chair of the Dade School Readiness Coalition and a member 
of the board of the Northwest Boys &amp; Girls Club.
Earlier this month, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and county commissioners 
were so impressed with Ivory's volunteering that they named Nov. 7 as Willie F. 
Ivory Day.</docText>

        <docText>Stray No More Inc., the only ?no-kill? animal shelter in Cambria, 
Bedford and Somerset counties, will find itself homeless come Monday morning.
And while the nonprofit organization?s leader vows to eventually reopen, 
volunteers are scrambling to quickly find homes for more than 20 pets.
?We?re just desperate at this point,? shelter Director Janet Good said in a 
telephone interview from the shelter, 325 Plank Road. ?I don?t know what I?m 
going to do with these guys if I can?t get them into homes.?
In hopes of placing all 22 cats and two dogs, the shelter ? beside BiLo 
market in Laurel View Plaza ? will be open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and 
tomorrow.
Stray No More?s phone number is (814) 443-3776. The shelter charges a $75 fee 
for adoptions, both for cats and dogs.
By 8 a.m. Monday, Good said the agency must vacate the small storefront it 
has called home for 13 months because of dwindling finances.
Rent runs from $1,400 to $1,800 per month, she said.
?We just can?t afford it,? Good said. ?The only money we get is donations 
and adoption fees.?</docText>

Sometimes a cold nose and a warm handful of fur can do a world of good. 

June Augsburg, at left, and Tyler are part of The Monroe Clinic's hospice pet 
program. Augsburg, a dog trainer and pet behaviorist, has trained Tyler well. 
Tyler and Augsburg take a full load of props, toys and costumes for Tyler 
along on their hospice visits -- there's so much equipment to take, Augsburg's 
friend and hospice volunteer partner Pat Landorf of Monroe always goes along to 
help. At 13, Tyler is getting on in years, so Augsburg recently acquired 
Murphy, a 5-month-old golden retriever. Tyler is helping Augsburg train Murphy to 
someday take over visiting hospice patients.
Fans of Tyler know that, for sure. The golden retriever in The Monroe 
Clinic's hospice volunteer pet program is famous for bringing a smile and is a 
popular visitor among patients in the program. 
"I get calls asking if Tyler could come visit. Not June -- but Tyler. Of 
course, he can't drive, so I get to go along," smiles June Augsburg, Tyler's 
trainer and owner. 
Tyler makes a perfect hospice volunteer. He's extremely well-behaved, and he 
follows Augsburg's commands to the letter. This is important for a hospice dog 
-- there can be no jumping or scratching a patient. "He must be obedient," 
Augsburg said. </docText>

When one deer hunter shoots another, the knee-jerk reaction is often one that 
questions the victim's negligence. 
That disturbs Steve Adcock, the hunter education/safety coordinator for the 
Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. 
"At least 95 percent of the time, when I'm telling somebody about a two-party 
deer hunting accident, the first question I get is 'Was the victim wearing 
orange?' " Adcock said. "I never have understood that. 
"Sure, wearing orange is an important part of hunting safety, and it is the 
law. But the sentence for not wearing orange is certainly not to be shot." 
The emphasis should be on the shooter's mistake, Adcock said. 
"The bottom line is that when you point your gun at something and pull the 
trigger, you are responsible for that bullet," he said. "You need to be aware of 
that. You need to be sure of what you are shooting at. You need be sure of 
what's beyond it." 
No doubt, the 1973 law that first required deer hunters to wear identifying 
orange clothing has had a great impact on hunting safety in Mississippi. 
In 1972, there were 80 total accidents that included 34 deaths. The state 
Legislature took immediate action and required either an orange cap or vest. In 
1973, there were still 76 total accidents but fatalities were reduced to 16, 
and accident rates continued to drop. Between 1973 and 1988, when the law was 
changed to require the current minimum of 500 square inches of orange, only five 
years produced 10 or more fatalities.</docText>

It seems incongruous that land-locked Utah would be home to an island. An 
island surrounded by salt water no less. But, Utah, with its mountains, deserts, 
salt flats and salt lake is truly a land of diversity. 
Antelope Island is one of our treasures, and is located just a few miles from 
downtown. From the mainland, the island appears barren and deserted, but this 
vision belies the abundance of flora and fauna that make the island their 
home. Easily accessible by crossing over on a 7-mile paved causeway, or by boat, 
it boasts white sandy beaches, a sailboat marina, nearly 20 miles of hiking, 
biking and horseback riding trails, wildlife viewing, picnicking, camping, and, 
because of the distance from the city and its lights, stargazing. 
Facts:
 The Great Salt Lake, in historic times, has varied from 4,192 to 4,212 feet 
above sea level. There is no outlet to the sea, so the depth depends on 
precipitation. The largest lake west of the Mississippi River, it is approximately 
30 miles wide and 70 miles long. Its depth averages 13 feet, and maxes out at 
34 feet. The salt content varies depending on the water level, but percentages 
of salt have been as high as 27%, eight times higher than the ocean. This 
gives the water buoyancy and legend goes that swimmers will float without sinking. 
The island encompasses 28,022 acres, with an elevation range from 4200 ft to 
its highest peak at 6596 ft. </docText>

Over the last week there has been considerable media coverage to the 
fact that Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was overruling local 
democracy to give the go-ahead to the controversial primate 
laboratory proposal of Cambridge University. We at SPEAC were not 
surprised. We have always believed that the pernicious influence of 
Lord Sainsbury, our unelected Science Minister, would swing the day.

It has always been our position that the heart of the struggle would 
be by ensuring that Cambridge University realizes that building the 
lab is going to be far more bother than it is worth.  Our position is 
unchanged by last week's news. We continue to fight as before. We 
continue to take our protests to the university. We are as determined 
as ever to fight every step of the way. The various rumours and 
Cambridge University's complaint about funding all indicate that the 
impact to date has been far greater than anticipated. And the best is 
yet to come.

So, time to dig in and keep the pressure on.  We've done it many 
times before, and we will damn well do it again. On Tuesday, 25th Nov 
there is an emergence demo in Cambridge against the University to 
remind them that we are still fighting strong (12noon, outside Kings 
Parade, in Cambridge - see website for a map).  People have been 
taking it on themselves to carry out some great actions - read the 
accounts at www.primateprison.org, and why not dabble in a bit of 
re-education

For those who can not make it, there is a phone/fax/email blockade of 
the administration department on Wednesday and Thursday, so get those 
coins and email accounts ready to make our message loud and clear. 
Contact details are below. You know what needs to be done: lets send 
a loud and clear message that the UK Government be damned, there is 
no way this lab is being built.

Keeping predators at bay with flashing lights and loud noises instead of 
bullets
When wolves and other large carnivores threaten people and livestock, 
wildlife managers often resort to killing them. But now there's hope for a non-lethal 
solution to controlling carnivores. New research shows that 
movement-activated guards with strobe lights and sound recordings can help keep wolves and 
bears away. 
"High-technology devices are much more expensive, complicated and limited in 
effectiveness than a single bullet from a high-powered rifle, but they also 
allow a predator to live ? surely the goal of conservation," say John Shivik of 
the United States Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services, National 
Wildlife Research Center and Utah State University in Logan; Adrian Treves, who did 
this work while at Conservation International in Madison, Wisconsin, and is 
now at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Bronx, New York; and Peggy Callahan 
of the Wildlife Science Center in Forest Lake, Minnesota. 
This work is part of a six-paper special section co-edited by Treves on the 
conflict between people and carnivores in the December issue of Conservation 
Biology. 
Conflicts between people and carnivores are rising as people spread into 
remote habitats and as large carnivores recover from past eradication efforts. 
While wildlife managers often address these conflicts by killing "problem" 
animals, this runs counter to conservation efforts and could impede the recovery of 
rare carnivores. "To promote the existence and expansion of large carnivores, 
conservation biologists should assist with the real-world problems predators 
cause," say the researchers. </docText>

Monitoring increases
Costly tests follow spread of chronic wasting disease in Western deer and 
elk


From staff and wire reports


Millions of dollars are being spent for increased testing to monitor the 
occurrence of chronic wasting disease in deer and elk throughout much of the 
nation.

Chronic wasting disease is a neurological disorder that causes deer and elk 
to become weak, wobbly and eventually die. The disease is related to the 
sheep disease scrapie and to mad cow disease, but so far there is no 
evidence it can spread to humans.

The disease has been documented in southeast Wyoming and northeast Colorado 
over the past few decades. In recent years the disease has been spreading, 
as far east as Minnesota and as far west as Colorado's Western Slope.

In Wisconsin, where there are two secular religions -- hunting and the Green 
Bay Packers -- deer hunting is so ingrained in the culture that schools 
close during peak season.

But last year hunting dipped by 10 percent in the Badger State. George 
Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, said some 
hunters were fearful of contracting CWD, even though it's never been found 
to cross the species barrier.

As CWD draws closer to Idaho's borders, experts worry it's just a matter of 
time before Idaho deer and elk populations contract it. Although no Idaho 
animals have tested positive yet, infected wild animals have been found in 
some neighboring states.

The tumultuous holiday season can be stressful enough for people who plan 
for it, but what about for our pets? The holidays can be satisfying and safe 
for your pet provided you take some steps to protect them from often hidden 
dangers.

Let's start with Thanksgiving. Roast turkey crowned with stuffing, mashed 
potatoes and giblet gravy, sweet potato casserole smothered with 
marshmallows, and pumpkin pie a la mode. That's just a partial list of what 
many will consume on Turkey Day, and the ambrosial description makes 
two-legged and four legged mouths water with anticipation.

Thanksgiving is all about giving thanks and sharing abundance. But before 
you think about sharing that mountain of meat, scrumptious leg bone, spicy 
stuffing, or amalgam of half-eaten desserts with your pet, think again. 
While overeating at Thanksgiving may be a "Tums time" for humans, it may 
result in an unexpected trip to the veterinary emergency room for pets, 
sometimes with tragic consequences.

Even if you don't end up at the emergency room with a pet, you may end up on 
your hands and knees cleaning up a smelly mess that spurted from either end 
of your pet. Unexpected dietary changes can lead to vomiting, diarrhea or 
worse. In fact, Thanksgiving keeps Dr. Steve Hansen, veterinary toxicologist 
and director of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center's staff, very busy. I 
recommend that you keep their Web site -- www.apcc.aspca.org -- handy, not 
just at Thanksgiving, but for any emergency that might arise.

Here are the top Turkey Day taboos:

&#x2022; Bones: Bones are not as healthy and safe as you might think. Raw bones can 
contain bacteria, and cooked bones can splinter. As a veterinarian I've had 
to take ham bones off a dog's swollen tongue and round steak bones off a 
dog's lower jaw, remove rib bones wedged between the upper teeth along the 
roof of the mouth, and have had turkey-bone shards perforate the intestinal 
track, causing internal trauma.

&#x2022; Fatty, rich foods: These typically include fatty trimmings off the ham or 
roast, turkey skin, butter-coated potato skins, and, of course, the gravy. 
Giving these to your pet is not a treat; it is dangerous for them.

At least three times a week, Tim Heffron rode his bike 20 
miles round trip to the Capital Area Humane Society shelter in Watertown 
Township.
The frequent trips were made easier because of his love for his faithful 
dogs, Angel and Snarfle, whom Heffron surrendered temporarily to the shelter until 
he found a home.
On Monday, Heffron, 46, was reunited with Snarfle, who moved with him to 
Grand Rapids where the man has a new lease on life, a new job and a home with a 
fenced back yard.
"I've never been homeless before, but learned so much from this experience," 
Heffron said. "There are so many opportunities, and every day I see people 
just throw them away."
Angel wasn't part of the reunion. The dog developed cancer and was euthanized 
last month.
"The society took great care for my dogs while I couldn't, even during 
Angel's last days," Heffron said.
The Capital Area Humane Society typically accepts surrendered pets and places 
them in new homes, but in Heffron's case the shelter agreed to keep his dogs 
until he could provide for them.</docText>

The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) is the 2003 recipient of 
the American Association of Equine Practitioners' (AAEP) Equine Welfare Award, 
the Lavin Cup. Named for AAEP past president A. Gary Lavin, VMD, the award is 
presented annually to a non-veterinary individual or organization that has 
demonstrated exceptional compassion or developed and enforced rules and guidelines 
for the welfare of the horse. The award was presented during the AAEP's 49th 
Annual Convention in New Orleans, La.,on Nov. 24.
The PRCA was selected for the Lavin Cup because of its dedication to 
protecting the health of the animals that participate in its events. The PRCA has made 
tremendous strides in recent years in uniting the rodeo industry regarding 
animal welfare issues as well as establishing detailed animal-use guidelines. To 
ensure the welfare of the animals, the PRCA employs a full-time animal 
welfare coordinator to administer its welfare program and regularly convenes the 
Humane Advisory Committee to review animal welfare issues. The PRCA also 
established a Veterinary Advisory Committee in 2001 and requires that a veterinarian 
be onsite at all PRCA-sanctioned events to inspect all animals prior to 
performance and to provide any needed onsite health care.
"It is a terrific honor and we are very humbled to be awarded the 2003 Lavin 
Cup," said Steven Hatchell, commissioner of the PRCA. "This is a testament to 
the hard work, leadership and guidance of many, including the PRCA Veterinary 
Advisory Committee, PRCA Humane Advisory Committee, rodeo veterinarians 
throughout the country and our own Cindy Schonholtz, animal welfare coordinator."</docText>

When Portsmouth photographer Marianne Pernold 
Young went to photograph Peter Rice with his four cats, he told her that the 
black one was skittish. 
"He told me not to get near that cat," Pernold Young recalled. "But I started 
playing with him. As I was leaving, I noticed him curled up in my camera 
bag." 
Young will bring her newest photo essay, "Celebrating the Human/Animal Bond," 
to the N.H. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals just in time for 
the holidays. After a private reception Dec. 3, the exhibit will be open to 
the public in the SPCA lobby until the end of January. 
According to Pernold Young, photo essays are her forte. She?s done them on 
fishermen, Portsmouth businesswomen, Seacoast "movers and shakers," and she?s 
working on one on pregnant women. People and pets seemed a good fit. 
The exhibit was the brainchild of Pernold Young?s friend Pat Crawford of Rye, 
a longtime SPCA volunteer. Last spring Crawford spearheaded the first "Art 
for Animals" exhibit. Local artisans brought work that was mostly 
animal-related, and showed it at a wine and hors d?ouevres party at the shelter. Half the 
profits went to the artists and half to the SPCA. 
"We made $16,000 in one afternoon," Crawford said. 
Crawford is known around the SPCA for thinking outside the box. he also 
established Andy?s Fund, an endowment for animals with serious medical conditions. 
As she chatted and Pernold Young hung her work, Buddy, a one-legged dog who 
benefited from Andy?s Fund, wandered around the lobby. </docText>

Losing your pet can be a devastating experience. Fortunately, there are some 
things you can do to help prevent this from happening or, at least, ensure a 
safe return if it does. 
 Here are some tips to help protect your pets from getting lost: 
Spay and neuter all pets. Both males and females are much less likely to 
wander if they have been altered. Spayed and neutered pets live longer, have fewer 
health problems and are happier in general. 
Make sure all of your pets are wearing current identification tags. Make sure 
the writing on the tag is legible and accurate. Without any identification on 
your pet, they are helpless, may become homeless and your chances of 
recovering them are greatly reduced. 
Inquire with your veterinarian about getting a microchip implanted in your 
pets. There are several microchips available and your vet can help you choose 
which one is most prevalent in your area. 
Make sure your yard is pet-proof so that your dogs cannot escape. Also, keep 
any gates locked so visitors do not accidentally leave them open. 
Always have your pets on a leash and never let them roam free in the </docText>

Why Target Greenpeace?


The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) works in courts, legislatures and 
communities to defend and preserve individual rights and liberties 
guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States. The People for 
the American Way Foundation advocates legal and social justice and the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the Constitution.


Editor&#x2019;s note: The following is an excerpt from the amicus brief filed by 
the ACLU and PFAWF. Click here to read the whole brief.


For two hundred years, the United States government has refrained from 
prosecuting advocacy groups whose members occasionally engage in peaceful 
civil disobedience to convey a constitutionally protected message.


The prosecution of Greenpeace indicates a sea change in that policy. Until 
now, only individual members of those groups have been prosecuted for their 
nonviolent, albeit unlawful, acts of civil disobedience. Greenpeace asserts, 
and there is reason to believe, that the government has selectively 
prosecuted it because of the content of its message. Selective prosecution 
violates the First Amendment and equal protection rights of Greenpeace; it 
also threatens every advocacy group whose message may offend the government 
of the moment.


The government&#x2019;s radical departure from two hundred years of history invites 
the closest scrutiny. It has chosen to prosecute Greenpeace, an organization 
that regularly criticizes government policies, for the civil disobedience of 
its members. Using an arcane statute designed to deter the even more arcane 
practice of sailor-mongering, the government apparently seeks to silence 
Greenpeace, despite already having prosecuted and punished the individual 
Greenpeace "climbers" who performed the acts of protest aboard the vessel 
Jade.


This prosecution threatens the very existence of Greenpeace, and because it 
appears to be based upon the content of its message, imperils the core 
values of the Constitution to which the ACLU and PFAWF are dedicated.

A surface mine might not seem like an ideal elk habitat. 
But because of the recovery efforts of two local mines, elk herds, 
sharp-tailed grouse and a variety of other animals are thriving at reclaimed mine sites 
In Moffat County.
Last year, the United States Department of the Interior named Trapper Mine 
one of the three best examples of mined land reclamation in the 25-year history 
of the federal surface mining laws.
Colowyo Coal Company, LLC was also honored last year for its deployment of 
innovative state-of-the-art technology, using global positioning systems (GPS) 
to improve efficiency and accuracy of spoil grading activities.
Collin Scott, environmental expert at Colowyo, said that a herd of 500 to 
1,500 elk usually winter on their reclaimed land, and sharp-tailed grouse, 
populations of which have declined precipitously over the western U.S. range, have 
been documented as making a rapid population increase at Trapper Mine.
The animals' habitat has been created by an expensive, time consuming mine 
reclamation process.
Mining companies are legally obligated to restore mined land to original 
conditions once operations are finished. 
"Reclamation is a process that begins before the first shovel full of dirt 
has been removed," Scott said.
Mines need permits to dig, and to get a permit, mine operations must develop 
a reclamation plan. Scott said the plan means taking inventory and studying 
the soil, vegetation and wildlife of the intended mine area.
Mining operations must bond their work, in the event that they default on 
their obligation to reclaim the land. Trapper Mine recently bonded new mining 
land for $25 million.
Earth moving is 75 percent of reclamation work, Scott said. That means 
backfilling mined areas and then grading the backfill. The goal is to blend the 
disturbed area into the surrounding area as best as possible.</docText>

SAVING the lives of Australia's injured furry friends can be financially 
draining and without the generosity of Collie businesses, local animal carer Wendy 
Thompson said she could not continue.
Food, milk and vet bills all add up said Ms Thompson, but thanks to a recent 
$1,000 donation from Worsley Alumina she can carry on with her important 
public service for a little longer.
One afternoon last month Ms Thomson received a sick and injured pelican, 
found by Worsley employees at their site during the storms.
Unfortunately, after being cared for by Ms Thompson in her bath tub for 
hours, the pelican died the same evening.
Seeing the vital service Ms Thompson provides and her dedication to the cause 
was enough to prompt Worsley to assist her to save more animals in the 
future. 
"This is a community donation for her service," said Worsley community 
relations officer Kym Betti.
"Sure, she helps us out but she helps heaps of injured animals and community 
organisations out as well."
Hundreds of injured animals have passed through Ms Thompson's home and, after 
being nursed to health, are released back into the wild.
"The animals just love you so much but the hardest thing is letting them go 
because otherwise they'll die," she said.
"If I didn't get assistance from places like Newmart and Worsley I wouldn't 
be able to do it."
Anyone who finds an injured or sick animal can take it to Ms Thompson's home 
at 35 Prinsep Street or phone her on 9734 1058.</docText>

The news may not be as good as it seems
A study of African elephants suggests they may be more numerous than they 
were four years ago, scientists say. 
They think there are from 400,000 to 660,000 elephants across the continent, 
with large numbers in southern Africa. 
But the scientists, from IUCN-The World Conservation Union, are interpreting 
their findings with extreme caution. 
They say one explanation may be that the elephants are fleeing to protected 
areas to try to escape human pressure, thus giving an unduly hopeful picture. 
They say habitat loss and competition between people and elephants for 
resources remain among the principal challenges in elephant conservation. 
The scientists are members of IUCN's African elephant specialist group, and 
their study, the African Elephant Status Report, updates one produced in 1999. 
More questions than answers 
It is the latest in a series derived from a database on African elephants 
which since 1986 has been compiling information from the 37 countries where the 
animals live. 
 
Ivory poachers remain a potent threat
The 1999 report concluded there were at least 300,000 elephants in Africa, 
and possibly as many as 487,000. 
The updated version says the higher figures may be partly explained by 
reported increases in savanna elephant populations in Botswana, Tanzania and 
Zimbabwe.</docText>

        <docText>If your menu for the December holidays always features prime
rib or filet mignon, this could be the year to cook your first goose
instead. Even opting to serve seven courses of fish, ? la the Italian
Christmas Eve tradition, might be easier on the wallet than buying beef
for a crowd.

Beef prices are soaring. At this time last year, live cattle traded at 64
cents per pound; now it's just over a dollar. And retail prices at some
stores have shot up about 40 cents per pound.

But not all price tags reflect the increase. To protect consumers from
sticker shock, some retailers are opting to absorb the extra cost, rather
than raise prices. Or they might charge more for other items to make up
the difference. Some restaurants are even steering customers toward other
entrees. McDonald's and Wendy's, for example, are hyping salads and lean
chicken pieces.

But they can't avoid raising beef prices for long, economists say.
...
Also impacting the market is the ban on Canadian beef exports into the
U.S., which went into effect in May as a result of one incident of mad-cow
disease in Alberta. Previously, about 8 percent of American beef came from
Canada.

At the same time the beef supply has been reduced, diet gurus have boosted
the appeal of red meat. Both the Atk`ins diet and the South Beach diet
tout a high-protein, low-carbohydrate approach to weight loss. So people
looking to shed a few pounds are ordering steak or a burger alongside
their salad. And they're willing to pay top dollar.</docText>

As most of our longtime readers know, Watertown was once the capital of
the stuffed geese industry. At one time hundreds upon hundreds of geese
were stuffed here in Watertown and most then found their way to New York
City where the liver was considered a delicacy.

The process was a time consuming one. Geese were force fed noodles several
times a day, including a night feeding. This constant feeding of course
fattened the birds and livers became enlarged. These enlarged livers were
the basis for pat? de foie gras which was served in such fine restaurants
as Luchow's which was located in the heart of New York City until it was
destroyed in a fire in 1995.
...
Although that industry died in Watertown about a quarter of a century ago,
it has not completely ended. It's still being practiced in fashionable
California where these livers are still considered a delicacy.

One of our readers alerted us to a short article in Time magazine this
fall which recounted some mischief created by a band of environmental
activists who are deeply opposed to the practice because it's inhumane.
The article was written by Terry McCarthy.
...
Counters Sarah Jane Blum, a spokeswoman for GourmetCruelty.com: 'If this
were being done to dogs or cats, the producers would without a doubt be in
prison for animal cruelty!'"

We'll leave it up to our readers as to whether this is cruelty to animals
but we're thinking Watertown's place in foie gras lore can't be all wrong.
...
Right now about the only thing remaining from that once flourishing
industry is the Watertown High School mascot, the "Gosling." That name did
come from the goose noodling industry here.

We thought this story was an appropriate one, given that there's been a
pretty big focus on food this week with the Thanksgiving festivities.

This holiday season, The Green Guide 
offers its first annual round up of authentic eco-products -- and those to 
avoid. Choosing from 12 categories, ranging from soap to automobiles, the Guide 
has selected top product picks from each to help consumers ease environmental 
impacts and adopt a healthier lifestyle. "This issue is in response to reader 
demands for a one-stop guide to products that it's currently most important to 
buy green for the sake of the environment and our health," says editor Mindy 
Pennybacker. During The Green Guide's first decade of publication, the 
organic-food market has grown by an average 20 percent a year, and reliable ecolabels 
have come into being for other items, such as wood and paper. Yet not all 
labels are reliable, and well-meaning consumers feel pressured to make sweeping 
lifestyle changes. The Green Guide has stepped in to help sort through claims and 
suggests a few choices one can make in daily life, right now, that will have 
far-reaching impacts on the marketplace. According to a recent poll, 69 
percent of subscribers have purchased a product or service after reading about it in 
The Green Guide, which accepts no advertising. To help readers further, "We 
plan to publish this top products guide annually," says publisher Wendy Gordon.

        <docText>A dead pit bull, a barely alive pit bull and two pit bull 
puppies were removed Wednesday from a South East Avenue property where a known 
animal abuser resides, according to a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals (SPCA) investigator. 
City police had received an anonymous tip that the dogs were being mistreated 
at the property, with one possibly dead, when they were dispatched to the 
scene Wednesday night. The investigation was later turned over to the SPCA. 

 
The dead pit bull was approximately 8 to 10 months old, according to SPCA 
cruelty investigator Monica Shaud. 
Two pit-bull puppies, approximately 6 months old, and what the SPCA believes 
to be the puppies' mother were removed from the property as well. 
The dogs' owner, Traheem J. Bennett, 20, of South East Avenue, faces two 
charges of failure to provide veterinary care, Shaud said. 
Bennett could be fined from $250 to $1,000 and be ordered to complete 30 days 
of community service for each charge, according to Shaud. 
The complaints will be filed at Bridgeton Municipal Court. 
According to a report by Bridgeton Police Ptl. Ronald Caldwell, the dead "dog 
appeared to have died from either natural causes or starvation." </docText>

        <docText>Fur is flying in more ways than one in high luxury's 
competitive world.

This time, however, it's off the designer shelves at department stores that 
are making a fortune from rejuvenating a product that was once the domain of 
matrons and the 1980s nouveau riche.

New York luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman, owned by the Neiman Marcus 
Group Inc. (nyse: NMGa - news - people), said on Friday it had struck gold 
with mink-lined rain jackets, shrugs and caplets sold at an in-store shop it 
opened four-and-a-half years ago.

Downstairs, it sells the fur ear-muffs, and leather cuffs with ermine tails, 
on the Christmas list of every fashionista.

"In the first year (2000), we quadrupled sales over the previous year's, so 
we knew we were onto something," Bergdorf Goodman's senior fashion director 
Robert Burke said.

Speaking to Reuters at an International Herald Tribune conference on the 
luxury industry, Burke said sales did not increase in 2001, the year of the 
September 11 attacks.

"That was not a moment for fur," he said. "(But) growth picked up in 2002 and 
this year we are seeing a real, significant increase," he added. "I've never 
seen consumers come back this way."

He said fur accounted for under 10 percent of store sales, but added it was 
not an insignificant amount.</docText>

Tomato soup with kale and cheese tortellini, vegetarian lasagna and pita
chips with hummus are not exactly at the top of the list on a typical
teenager's lunch menu.

But in fact, several hundred Lawrence High School students patiently stood
in line at the high school cafeteria to sample those vegetarian dishes at
lunchtime two weeks ago.

The students were taking part in the Good Food education program ? funded
by the Lawrence Township Education Foundation with a goal of educating
high school students and staff about food choices.

The change in the menu lasted just one day, but there is a possibility
that it could be repeated later in the year, said Mikey Azzara of Cherry
Grove Organic Farm and Marybeth DiLorenzo, the school district's food
service director.
...
Emily, who is a vegan, first suggested providing options for vegans and
vegetarians in the high school cafeteria to LHS Principal Donald Proffit
last year.

Vegetarians and vegans avoid meat ? but they part company on dairy
products. Vegetarians eat dairy products, but vegans do not because it
comes from animals.

At about the same time, Mr. Azzara approached Mr. Proffit to discuss
including fresh produce ? possibly organic produce ? in the high school
kitchen. Mr. Proffit introduced Mr. Azzara and Emily, and they decided to
merge their ideas.
...
Emily and Mr. Azzara said the objective of the Good Food education program
is not to completely remake the cafeteria into one that serves vegetarian
or vegan fare, but rather to have that option on the side.

"We are basically planting a seed in their minds," Mr. Azzara said.</docText>

Friday, 5 December 2003, 12:28 pmArrested for free speech. BRUCE HUBBARD emailed the local US Embassy to 
protest Bush's invasion of Iraq. He was arrested and charged with causing Offence. 
We think this is a serious threat to free speech in NZ. Under Bruce's bail 
conditions, he must stay 250m away from the US Consulate. Help to create a "Bruce 
Hubbard Free Zone" around the Consulate. Then put on a Bruce Hubbard face 
mask (they will be handed out on the day) and approach the Consulate - let's all 
be Bruce for the occasion! Join Bruce and the Friends of Free Speech for some 
serious fun. Let's make a farce of this farcical - but dangerous - attack on 
free speech. Poster available </docText>

        <docText>With the trail growing cold, the FBI yesterday announced
it is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of
Terra Linda High graduate Daniel Andreas San Diego, who is wanted in
connection with two East Bay bombings linked to animal rights causes.

Also yesterday, authorities released newly unsealed search warrant
affidavits in which the FBI spells out much of its case against San Diego.

Among new information revealed is that one of the bombs had nails attached
to act as potentially lethal or maiming shrapnel. No one was injured in
the bombings.
...
"My wife and I do not believe that he is responsible for the conduct with
which he is charged," said an emotional San Diego, reading from a
statement while his wife stood at his side on a rain-soaked plaza at the
San Francisco Civic Center yesterday afternoon. "Nevertheless, we
recognize that the government has brought a serious charge, and it must be
addressed by our son. While we know Andreas must be frightened, we hope he
will come forward and confront this accusation, knowing that we will stand
by him throughout this ordeal."
...
An animal rights group calling itself Revolutionary Cells claimed
responsibility for the explosions and said the two companies were targeted
because of their ties to New Jersey-based Huntingdon Life Sciences, which
conducts drug and chemical experiments on animals for other firms.
...
The FBI searched computers and hard drives at San Diego's home, apparently
looking for the electronically posted messages taking responsibility for
the bombing, but officials said yesterday they could not make a direct link.
...
While his parents yesterday said their son is "a thoughtful, responsible
young man" the FBI considers him a threat.

"We believe he is a dangerous individual," Traver said, noting San Diego
has a handgun registered to him that has not been found. "He has
accomplished two bombings, and he had a truckload of material to do it
again. Whatever his cause, he is passionate about it. He will try and bomb
again somewhere, and he has upped the ante with the use of shrapnel." </docText>

When Jeffrey ?Free? Luers and Craig ?Critter? Marshall torched three SUVs
at Romania Chevrolet in Eugene, Oregon, in June 2000, they set in motion a
new era of monkey-wrenching.

While Luers awaited trial, 36 more SUVs burned at the same dealership.
Luers? 22-year prison sentence is a reflection of a society that values
corporate free enterprise, consumerism and property above the environment.

The communiqu? following the second Romania fire announced:

?Gas-guzzling SUVs are at the forefront of this imperialistic culture?s
caravan toward self-destruction. We can no longer allow the rich to parade
around in their armored existence, leaving a wasteland behind in their
tire tracks. We must strike out against what destroys us before we all
choke on smog.?

As many urban drivers replace passenger cars with SUVs, carbon dioxide
levels in the air have increased three-fold. The Surface Transportation
Policy Project (STPP) in August reported that two million tons, or 57
percent of all air pollutants in Los Angeles, California, come from
tailpipe emissions. Whether an oil tanker spill in Karachi or the proposed
oil exploration in the caribou breeding grounds of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, America?s consumption of 25 percent of the world?s oil is
killing the environment and people alike.

While SUVs have become a legitimate anti-pollution target, does torching
them make a difference?

Since the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) began attacking SUVs, General
Motors has alerted its dealers to beware of the eco-sabotuers. Kroll,
Inc., a ?global threat management? company, has been advising SUV dealers
in security strategies and has recommended that they establish contact
with FBI terrorist specialists to share information. All American
Pontiac-Buick-GMC in Houston, Texas, hired 24-hour security and installed
a $100,000 video surveillance system in response to an incident on
September 3, when eco-vandals damaged two-thirds of the SUV inventory. The
president of the dealership commented, ?It?s definitely going to impact
our bottom line.? Unwilling to accept any responsibility for the nation?s
growing levels of auto-emission pollution, automakers and dealers are
instead practicing a siege mentality by offering up to $100,000 rewards
for ELF members. </docText>

People and insects aren't the only creatures on the planet that can grow a 
fungus for dinner. A salt marsh snail works the leaves of a plant in what 
researchers say looks like a simple form of farming. 

SLASH AGRICULTURE. Leaf from a salt marsh shows snail farm: a fungus-infected 
cut adorned with droppings.
Silliman
The snail Littoraria irrorata saws long gashes down the narrow leaves of the 
dominant plants in East Coast salt marshes. It doesn't eat the fresh tissue 
but instead waits until fungus riddles the leaf wound, explains Brian Silliman 
of Brown University in Providence, R.I. Snail droppings boost the amount of 
fungus that grows in the cut, say Silliman and Steven Y. Newell of the University 
of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island. They report in an upcoming 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the snails need to eat fungus 
to thrive. 
Previously, biologists had observed cultivation of edible fungus only in some 
beetles, termites, and ants (SN: 4/24/99, p. 261). The snail behavior "seems 
to be the first time fungal farming has been found outside of insects?and the 
first time in a marine system," says Silliman. "Fungal farming may be more 
widespread than we thought." </docText>

Read all about the essential vitamins and minerals you need now?and where to 
get them
Let's get something straight right away: This isn't one of those articles 
promising that there's a Fountain of Youth in this vitamin or that mineral. We've 
been around long enough to know there's no such thing. But what you do need 
to know is that many of the problems commonly associated with aging can be 
prevented, if not completely eliminated, if you adjust your nutritional intake to 
the needs of your changing body.
Speaking of changing bodies, did you know that with each passing birthday the 
human stomach produces less hydrochloric acid needed to digest food and 
properly absorb adequate amounts of certain key nutrients? By age 50, this 
dwindling supply of acid causes a vitamin B-12 inadequacy in at least one in four 
Americans; by age 75, it affects about 40 percent. What are the telltale symptoms 
of getting too little vitamin B-12? Memory lapses. Joint pain. Fatigue. 
Tingling hands and feet. Sounds a lot like aging, doesn't it? "People often say, 
'You're just getting old.' But many of the classic signs of aging overlap with 
the symptoms of nutritional inadequacy," says Jeffrey Blumberg, Ph.D., of the 
Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in 
Boston. "Just because you feel that you're aging doesn't mean it's because 
you're aging."
But don't go blaming your stomach for every midlife complaint. Fact is, you 
may be coming up short in the vitamins department?just like millions of others 
who have passed the half-century mark?even if you're eating a perfect food 
pyramid.
So, how do you meet those needs? In many cases, a daily "senior formula" 
multivitamin supplement is all you need to fill the void. In other cases, even 
that multi may not be enough. Here's what you need to know:
Vitamin B-12
We talked about the necessity of getting enough B-12. Here's a case where 
that senior formula multivitamin has you covered. You can also get additional 
B-12 in your diet by eating meat. But because this vitamin is "bound" to protein 
(making it hard for your body to absorb), even if you eat plenty of beef, 
chicken, and fish, it's hard to get enough B-12 by diet alone</docText>

All Woodcreek High boys basketball coach Paul Hayes and his Timberwolves did 
last season was take the community on one of the most exciting, drama-filled 
rides in this area has ever witnessed. 

For everyone involved, including then sports editor Jeffrey Weidel and 
myself, it was a wild and crazy ride that finally ended with a 70-49 loss to 
national power Mater Dei of Santa Ana.

Along the way the Timberwolves piled up an unprecedented list of firsts, 
beginning with the school?s first Sierra Foothill League title and followed by 
their initial trip to Arco Arena, where they preceded to knock off top-seeded 
Sacramento 63-49 for the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II title, another first.

Oakmont?s 1994 run to the state title game was the only other time a 
Roseville-area school had gone as far as high school basketball?s final stop. 

While their ever-growing contingent of ?Super Fans? continued to be 
pleasantly surprised by their antics, Woodcreek players were anything but surprised, 
and felt about as respected as Rodney Dangerfield. </docText>

        <docText>The 880-pound bull buffalo that Bud Koeppen has dubbed Big Bad John raised 
his head and cast a wary look at the men standing on the other side of the 
electrified fence. 
Looking into the eyes of a bison, the largest animal native to North America, 
is likely to inspire thankfulness for fences, electricity and the safety they 
provide, but Big Bad John, who is less than a year old, seemed more 
interested in the movements of Annie, the more inquisitive of Koeppens? two dogs. 
Koeppen and his brother and business partner, Wally, are still adjusting to 
the fact that the Brokenwagon Bison Ranch has moved from the planning and 
construction stage to reality. 
The buffalo have been roaming for just a week on the 150-acre pasture on the 
Wheeler farm once owned by their parents, Clarence and Myrtle Koeppen. 
Their bison herd, acquired at an auction in Lewiston, Minn., includes one 
bull, two calves and seven cows, each of whom is expected to deliver a calf in 
the spring. When they bought their animals, they weren?t sure how many they 
could load into the cattle trailer belonging to their friend, John Williams. As it 
turned out, they would have had room for another cow or two more calves. </docText>

        <docText>As the mercury dips we all take shelter inside and 
seek warmth, meanwhile our four ? legged pals sit languishing in the chilly 
weather, for sometimes extended periods of time.
The Fort Record contacted the Edmonton Human Society (formerly the Edmonton 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals -- SPCA) and local dog sitter 
and canine expert Lisa Ecker, Owner ? operator of Fort Saskatchewan Canine 
Services.
?With dogs, people should keep in mind that not all dogs are built for 
lengthy periods of time outdoors. Generally short haired breeds, younger, and older 
animals, no matter how big they are, do not do well outdoors for long periods 
of time. If you do have an outdoor dog, and typically these animals are 
larger, long ? haired breeds, you need to still have an insulated or heated doghouse 
to give them shelter from the cold. In the doghouse we strongly recommend NOT 
having blankets, because they can freeze and then they actually make the 
animal colder. Instead we recommend using straw as bedding material. People can 
usually get straw by checking classified ads to see what farmers have for sale,? 
said Melissa Boisvert, Edmonton Humane Society Communications Officer. ?
Outdoor water dishes are a bad idea. If you?ve ever stuck your tongue to a metal 
pole when you were younger then you can imagine what it is like. Please use some 
other material than metal for your dogs water outside. Snow is not sufficient 
enough to be a water source. They really need to have fresh water ?.
Ecker echoed the concerns of the Humane Society and offered another option 
for bedding material, wood chips.
?First and foremost in winter are the icy conditions. A lot of people use 
salt to keep the ice and snow from cluttering their sidewalks, driveway or 
street. What that salt can do is really damage an animals feet and paws. It is 
really brutal on their feet just as it is on our vehicles. What you want to do if 
you are not using protective wear on your dogs feet is make sure that they are 
really well rinsed off after a walk. That salt can really irritate their skin,?
 said Ecker. ?Also keeping the hair cut fairly short if you have an indoor 
animal. That will help to prevent the ice and snow from balling up and causing 
irritation between their toes. A consideration for short coated dogs that are 
not outside a lot is protective winter wear like a sweater or jacket. Just 
because they have a fur coat on the outside does not mean that they are anymore 
capable of keeping warm than we are when the temperature starts to drop below 
minus 10?.</docText>

While game-viewing in Africa is normally the preserve of affluent white 
tourists, the Mokolodi Nature Reserve does something radically different by 
exposing black Africans to the continent's rich animal and plant kingdom.
The formula has been so successful that 12,000 children who would otherwise 
have no contact with wild Africa now attend a range of free educational and 
residential courses each year at the reserve in Botswana.
They can walk with Mokolodi's four-strong herd of elephants, stroke two 
orphaned cheetahs until they purr, go on bush walks and have a range of wildlife 
experiences that would normally cost foreign tourists thousands of pounds.
This Christmas Mokolodi will partly ease Botswana's huge HIV/Aids burden by 
offering a bush camp to 300 children either infected with the virus or orphaned 
by the pandemic.
"It all started when a friend of mine said how sad it was for children in 
Africa to grow up without really knowing their environment," said Gwithie Kirby, 
one of Mokolodi's founders.</docText>

        <docText>n his dim trailer in the pines, Virgil Butler writes of 
killing.

He once shot a man to death in the parking lot of a bar. In the American 
invasion of Panama, he killed at least two enemy soldiers at close range. But that 
is not the violence that drives him to his keyboard.

He is haunted, instead, by the nine years he made his way in the world by 
slaughtering chickens.

In the chilled dark of a Tyson processing plant, Butler killed 80,000 birds a 
shift. He snapped their legs into shackles so they hung upside down. He slit 
their throats. Every two seconds, another chicken came at him down the line, 
squawking and flapping. It was not possible, then, to think much.

But Tyson fired Butler last fall, for reasons the company won't specify. He 
has time now to think. The man he shot at the bar ? that was self-defense. The 
soldiers he killed ? that was war. It's the birds that shadow his sleep. He 
sits cross-legged on his sagging bed and pulls the keyboard to his lap. "There 
is blood everywhere.... It's just you and the dying chickens.... You are 
ashamed to tell others what you do at night while they are asleep in their beds."

Butler writes for hours each day. His words have electrified animal-rights 
activists around the globe.

Posted at http://www.cyberactivist.blogspot.com, Butler's account of a career 
on the kill floor is being translated into French and Dutch. Britain's 
Guardian newspaper has recommended his Web log as "powerful stuff," a "must-read." 
Supporters in Singapore and Russia e-mail questions. Strangers from across 
America send cards.

Veterans of the animal rights movement say Butler has done more for their 
cause than celebrity endorsements from actress Pamela Anderson and former Beatle 
Paul McCartney. Lucy Kelley, a 60-year-old cook in Mt. Juliet, Tenn., said she 
could find only one response to the blog: "I don't eat chicken any more."

"Virgil's description of the horrible abuse of chickens in our nation's 
slaughterhouses ... has turned more people vegetarian than anything else we did 
last year," said Bruce Friedrich, director of vegan outreach for People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals. With 750,000 members, PETA is the largest 
animal-rights group in the world. "We get letters and e-mails about it constantly," 
Friedrich said.

In a house on a ranch in a valley, where grizzlies, wolves 
and cougars sometimes roam, Alayne Marker and Steve Smith live in a white 
modular house that smells faintly of fine food and wet dog.
In and around it live animals, many of them crippled, blinded, abused, 
neglected or rejected by previous owners: 27 dogs, 15 cats, 16 chickens, eight pigs, 
three ewes, six cows, nine horses and one cancerous, elderly mule named 
Lonesome George.
Five years ago, Alayne and Steve bought this 160-acre patch. They planned to 
retire there in 10 years or so.</docText>

        <docText>The black cat with a white stomach and paws curled up in Rapp's arms and 
purred. 
Rapp, who takes care of the feline area of the Clark County Humane Society's 
animal shelter, held out her hand and asked for a high-five. 
Rascal pawed her back. 
Rapp has three dogs and two cats at home, but Rascal is her pride at work. 
On Saturday, she was pleased with the number of adoptions that had occurred 
thus far that day, but she knew Rascal still didn't have a family. 
The animal shelter held a "Meet Our Mutts" adoption day, with adoption rates 
cut from $75 to $58.50 for dogs and from $35 to $20 for cats. 
Although Pam Campbell, the shelter's adoption coordinator, had hoped for more 
than the seven adoptions, she was pleased with the results. 
"We had two boxers that grew up together that were adopted together," 
Campbell said. "We didn't think that would happen." </docText>

        <docText>With salon appointments booked weeks in advance, everyone wants to be turned 
out for the holidays. A wash and blow- dry, a color and cut, a nail trim and 
maybe some poinsettia-red polish. 
Nothing's more relaxing than a nice flea dip and a spritz of "Bono Sport" or 
a full-body brushing and a dab of "Beautifur." Grooming, at the hands of a 
professional, is appreciated by canine clientele as much as it is by doting 
owners. 
While Mickey, a miniature poodle, wouldn't comment after his teal-blue dye 
job, he was in no hurry to escape Kathy Kellman's gentle handling. The Barking 
Lot groomer combed out every strand of his baby-fine fur. She neatly 
scissor-snipped from ruff to tail and transformed him from dandelion puff to soft-spun 
cotton candy. 
It's a dog's life, for sure. But grooming is serious business. Bathing and 
brushing, along with ear cleaning, teeth washing and nail clipping, keeps pets 
in top shape. Grooming improves an animal's touchability, minimizes shedding, 
reduces allergens and alerts pet owners to health problems in their earliest 
stages. </docText>

        <docText>This holiday season, The Green Guide 
offers its first annual round up of authentic eco-products -- and those to 
avoid. Choosing from 12 categories, ranging from soap to automobiles, the Guide 
has selected top product picks from each to help consumers ease environmental 
impacts and adopt a healthier lifestyle. "This issue is in response to reader 
demands for a one-stop guide to products that it's currently most important to 
buy green for the sake of the environment and our health," says editor Mindy 
Pennybacker. During The Green Guide's first decade of publication, the 
organic-food market has grown by an average 20 percent a year, and reliable ecolabels 
have come into being for other items, such as wood and paper. Yet not all 
labels are reliable, and well-meaning consumers feel pressured to make sweeping 
lifestyle changes. The Green Guide has stepped in to help sort through claims and 
suggests a few choices one can make in daily life, right now, that will have 
far-reaching impacts on the marketplace. According to a recent poll, 69 
percent of subscribers have purchased a product or service after reading about it in 
The Green Guide, which accepts no advertising. To help readers further, "We 
plan to publish this top products guide annually," says publisher Wendy Gordon. 
       Below are the top picks and the reasons to choose them. All are 
available by mail and phone order.For contact info, more great products and a look </docText>

Scientists say lab experiments on monkeys, dogs and other animals are
needed to develop and test new medicines. But activists call the tests
cruel and unusual punishment ? and they're taking the animal-rights debate
to the courts and the streets
...
On the video monitor, two small marmosets ? tree-dwelling South American
monkeys with white ear tufts ? cling tightly to each other, looking
terrified. A third writhes in pain, postsurgery, on the floor of its cage;
others have raw and bloody head wounds that seem crudely stitched up. The
animals appear in a 21-minute expos? called Cutting Edge, shot for the
British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in one of Cambridge
University's neuroscience research labs. The monkeys' brains had been
deliberately damaged in experiments meant to simulate the symptoms of
stroke and Parkinson's disease. Important research that could help save
human lives ? but at an obvious cost in animal suffering. 
...
Though vegetarianism is the biggest issue for animal-rights activists ?
and fur gets a lot of attention because it involves both celebrities and
fashion ? the use of animals in scientific research is acquiring a higher
profile in the ethical battle for the hearts and minds of policymakers and
public alike. Many within the movement apply relentless pressure to
stockholders, suppliers and other business contacts, and some ? a small
substratum ? believe that a proper response to violence against animals is
violence against humans. </docText>

        <docText>Michael Spencer and his 16-year-old son, Sean, weren't looking
to make history when they drove down to the Eastern Shore from their
Montgomery County home yesterday. But if the first Sunday of deer hunting
in Maryland in 280 years was designed for anyone, it seemed perfect for them.

As Seventh-day Adventists, who celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays, the
Spencers, who live in Silver Spring, went to church on the opening day of
deer season. This year though, like thousands of other hunters, they got
in weekend shooting by taking advantage of a one-day reprieve from a state
law that has banned Sunday hunting since the Colonial era. 
...
"The deer population has gotten so out of control, it's changed people's
minds about Sunday hunting," said Valerie Connelly, a spokeswoman for the
Maryland Farm Bureau. "It's not just soybeans and corn anymore. It's fruit
trees, and nursery and landscaping stock that's being destroyed."

With the Department of Natural Resources estimating Maryland's deer
population at nearly 300,000, wildlife management experts say allowing
about 75,000 licensed firearms hunters a crack at sika and white-tailed
deer yesterday might help cull 100,000 or more animals from the
overpopulated herd during the two-week firearms season. Bow hunters were
allowed a similar one-day Sunday hunt Nov. 2. 
...
Opponents of Sunday hunting, including animal-rights groups, some
religious groups, horseback riding clubs and others, say hikers and
outdoors enthusiasts should be allowed to roam the woods on Sundays
without fear of stray gunfire.

"From our perspective, Sunday was the only day during hunting season
without worrying you'll get your head blown off," said Cindy Wood, a
longtime member of the Wicomico Hunt, a fox-hunting group. "But with this
many counties excluded, including Wicomico, it lessens the impact. Maybe
it is a decent compromise." </docText>

The state of animal farming in this country is abysmal. The small farm and
slaughterhouse have been almost entirely replaced by the vertically
integrated meat and animal products conglomerate; environmental disaster
and unintentional cruelty to animals in the name of efficiency have become
de facto standards in much of the industry. Chelsea Purvis' recent guest
column ("Sustainable Farms Offer More Humane Option," November 18, 2003)
does an excellent job describing the horrible conditions of mainstream
animal farming. What lies outside the scope of Purvis' column, however, is
that elements of the environmental far left have long campaigned for
lifestyle-based non-solutions that fail to address the problem in a
comprehensive manner.

Groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and
others have taken advantage of the situation to vociferously promote
veganism (and, as a less acceptable alternative, vegetarianism) amongst
socially conscious consumers. PETA and its allies have an ulterior motive
grounded in extreme ideology: the belief that any form of animal
domestication is automatically immoral; the leaders of PETA believe that
the only "ethical" contact between humans and animals is no contact at
all. PETA's philosophy would leave us without not only household pets, but
also antibiotics, the smallpox vaccine and most of the rest of modern
medicine.
...
Veganism is not activism because it is equivalent to abstention; given the
general public's immutable predilection for animal products, veganism is
passivism, it is withdrawal, it is an ideologically grounded ignorance of
a superior alternative.</docText>

The literature of the vegan movement loves to quote Socrates: "the unexamined 
life is not worth living." Socrates is indeed correct, but vegan propaganda 
simply replaces one brand of ignorance with another. I am a pragmatist, and I 
believe that the general public will never give up meat, milk, eggs and other 
animal products. Indeed, trends of the past few years have shown that the 
American public's appetite for beef has only grown along with its waistline; though 
veganism and vegetarianism continue to rise, so does meat production.</docText>

Remember your best friends at Christmas time with gifts from the shelter's 
pet shop. A nice selection of dog and cat toys, and rawhide treats at reasonable 
prices are in stock. One gift suggestion is a new matching leash and collar; 
for an additional $1 get a computerized identification tag. As long as lost 
pets are wearing theID tag, the shelter can reunite them with their owners by 
looking up corresponding information in the SPCA computer files. It may someday 
prove to be the best gift ever. 
For the animal lovers on your list, check out the new supply of SPCA

        <docText>Q: One night my 2-year-old female Burmese kitty was skittish and hiding, 
very unusual for her. The next night she flew through the house screaming and 
hissing at the back door. We saw an opossum at the door hissing. My kitty 
wouldn't relax for days. The vet gave her Valium. She was fine until she looked 
into a dark picture and saw her reflection. She went crazy!! Again screaming and 
hissing and urinating while she was running. Tonight for no reason, she went 
crazy again. I don't know what to do.
    Dr. Nichol: Your cat's panic must be unsettling for the whole family. 
While a little fear is normal, some cats have a harder time because they are 
genetically shy. That possum looked and smelled really strange. Now your kitty is 
hypervigilant, waiting for terror to strike again.
    You can turn this around but you must act quickly. Contact your animal 
control department or a local feed store and rent a Have-A-Heart trap. Bait the 
trap with some tasty garbage and humanely catch yourself a varmint. A scenic 
drive to the national forest will be this pest's one-way ticket to a new life. 
Next, fear-proof your home. Cover anything reflective with paper so that 
nothing can scare this poor cat.
    Your kitty needs to feel safe. Medication can make a big difference, but 
be careful. A physical exam and lab profile are both important. Provided she's 
healthy, adding the antianxiety drug clomipramine will allow her to be 
gradually weaned off the Valium? a drug that can interfere with learning and 
possibly damage her liver.
    Learning is your cat's ticket to a better life. Reward her with a treat? 
only when she's calm. If nervous or frightened, she must be removed from the 
threatening situation but not comforted. Any response from you will be 
considered a reward; you could get more fear, not less. As this girl improves, 
gradually remove the paper from the reflective surfaces in your home. If she's calm 
when she sees her reflection from a distance, reward her with a treat. Very 
slowly reintroduce reality.
    Counterconditioning like this takes time. If you need guidance, you are 
welcome to contact me again. Be patient and you will both win. You are a caring 
soul.</docText>

The Priceless Parrot Preserve is the first and only animal sanctuary in New 
York dedicated exclusively to the permanent care of exotic birds. 
Both Ed and Marietta have been involved with exotic birds for many years, Ed 
as a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. They do not breed, sell or adopt out any 
bird that comes into their care, and they say that every bird taken in will 
live the rest of its life with dignity in the preserve. 
Initially the Averys bore the cost of adopting and rescuing the birds 
themselves, but they have now formed a non-profit, 601-C3 organization funded by 
public donations. 
Animal News Center: Tell us about yourself. How did you get interested in 
animal welfare, and in creating this parrot sanctuary? 
EA: My wife, Marietta. We've had birds and pets all our lives. We were 
married a few years and I said "I'd like to have a 'Baretta' bird," and she said, 
"Ok, what kind of bird is that?" I said, "It's a cockatoo." 
So she bought me one for Christmas and that started the whole thing.</docText>

        <docText>Paralyzed by fear, the little creature crouched on the centerline of the 
two-lane road. Cars zipped by in both directions, coming perilously close to its 
perfectly still nose and tail. 
Now, if this weird holiday saga were a fable instead of a true account, I 
might cast a more clearly sympathetic character in the lead role. Perhaps the 
creature about to be fatally squished would be a squirrel and bring 
warm-and-fuzzy-tailed associations to mind. 
Or, since mice seem to have excellent PR agents these days, maybe it would be 
mouse. Or, I could blur the issue of identity by saying only that it was a 
rodent. 
My spouse Joyce's first thought was that, sadly, whatever it was, it was 
already dead. But then why was it still sitting up, she wondered. As she passed 
by, she saw a whisker twitch. Running late to meet me for a movie, she drove on 
half a block, sickened by the certainty that the terrified animal would be 
killed within seconds. 
Then, obeying her heart instead of her wristwatch, she whipped the car 
around, jumped out, scooped up the little creature with a newspaper, and slid it 
into a tiny cookie box, emptied for the emergency. Dissatisfied, Joyce quickly 
bought a 12-pack of sodas, dumped the cans into the car and put the dazed animal 
(plus a chocolate cookie) into the carton and taped it shut -- except for air 
holes, of course. 
"Now let me make sure I've got this right," I said in disbelief when Joyce 
finally arrived downtown. "You rescued a baby RAT and have it in a Pepsi box. 
And I'm not supposed to believe that while we're inside watching a movie, it's 
going to gnaw out of the carton and chew up the car's upholstery?" </docText>

Silent killers in our rivers 
THE role of otters in the rapid and devastating decline in Scottish wild salmon stocks may previously have been dramatically underestimated, new research indicates. 
A study by the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust (WRFT) shows that otters caught and ate 28 per cent of wild salmon captured and electronically tagged as part of a radio tracking project on the River Ewe. 
Now scientists have called for the experiment to be repeated on a larger scale to discover whether any action should be taken to prevent the mammals' further impact on salmon stocks in Scottish river systems. 
The main aim of the project was to help the Ewe District Salmon Fisheries Board target areas of the river system that were in greatest need of habitat and stock restoration, but also to discover the relationship between spawning salmon and other wildlife. 
Twenty-five wild Ewe salmon were caught, tagged and released back into the river from June to October 2001. 
The River Ewe catchment area, which includes Loch Maree and the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve in Wester Ross, is recognised as among the most spectacular and highly-valued natural wildlife habitats in Europe, and the freshwater fisheries are internationally famous. 
The WRFT report said: "Our observations, together with data from radio tracking, suggest that seven of the 25 radio tagged salmon (28 per cent) were taken by otters between mid November and early December. The fate of two other tagged fish is unknown." 
It adds that, with salmon stocks seriously depleted within the Kinlochewe area, "even a 10 per cent level of predation may impact adversely upon the subsequent recruitment of juvenile salmon". 
Dr John Webster, an independent scientific advisor to Scottish Quality Salmon, which represents the salmon farming industry, said: "If the level of predation of the tagged fish was as high as this report suggests, it could well be that the impact of otters [on the wild salmon population] has been dramatically underestimated. If you combine this report's findings about otters with the impact of mink, they may be taking a very significant proportion of salmon in the rivers." 
He added: "It is very difficult to know what the solution to this is as otters are highly protected. However, salmon are also protected. There are a number of options, and otters can legally be trapped and relocated to less sensitive rivers if it can be proved that they are having a significant impact." 
Destructive control by culling was out of the question, he said, and something that "no-one should condone or suggest". 
Numbers of the Eurasian otter, the only native UK species, declined sharply in the early 1960s due to organochlorine pollution, but have recently made something of a comeback. 
Populations are still healthy in northern and western Scotland and the UK numbers are starting to increase, but are still a long way off census information from the early 1950s. The last government figures compiled in 1996 estimated that there were 6,600 otters in Scotland, compared to just over 7,000 in the rest of the UK. They were afforded legal protection in Scotland in 1983, but remain threatened due to habitat destruction, pollution and high road mortality. 
Dr David Carss, an expert on vertebrate ecology at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Banchory, who has himself conducted radio tracking research on otters, said: "I guess we are into new territory now because salmon stocks have declined so drastically in the last decade. As more people start looking they are finding evidence that otters do predate large adult salmon just on the point of spawning or just after." 
John McKenzie, a part-owner of fishing rights on the Ewe and a member of the Ewe District Salmon Fishery Board, said: "At face value it is a source of concern, that's for sure.

in the presence of his wife, Sharon.? He was eighty two.? The 27th of
November also marked the 30th anniversary of his proposal to Sharon, as well
as his daughter?s birthday.? In his last moments, Ron listened to a
recording of wolf calls, finding comfort in the sounds of the animals he
loved throughout his life.?
His book The North Runner (1980, Holt, Rhineheart &amp; Winston; winner of the
best non-fiction paperback award of the Canadian Paperback Publishers
Association) has just been reprinted as an expanded version, with some of
Ron?s own photographs, and published by Natural Heritage.? It is about
Yukon, the mix-wolf-dog breed companion who shared wilderness adventure with
Ron.?Heritage has also re-issued new and revised editions of The Place in

They brought puppies. They wore buttons. They even had a celebrity ? Rue 
McClanahan of "The Golden Girls." More important, the congregation of true 
believers on the City Hall steps had a righteous mission: winning passage of 
legislation touching on two of the subjects closest to the hearts of New Yorkers ? 
housing and pets.
In front was the laser-focused sponsor of the bill, Councilwoman Melinda Katz 
of Forest Hills. In back was a layered assembly of 30 enthusiastic 
supporters, rising along the steps. In the center, Ms. McClanahan, who posed for 
pictures, called the legislation "common sense" and "good for the city."

The only unscripted moment came when Elinor Molbegott, a lawyer with the 
Humane Society of New York, took the microphone to talk about why "many people are 
waiting for this legislation." A participant named Rebecca emitted an 
unexpected high-pitched whine, causing Ms. Molbegott to pause and smile. "Isn't that 
right?" she asked. Rebecca, a 3-month-old puppy, had no immediate reply.</docText>

        <docText>Lee Boyd Malvo was the spotter -- not the shooter -- 
in all but one of last year's sniper killings, Malvo told a psychologist, 
contradicting the confession he gave to police. 

Malvo blamed himself for the arrest of sniper mastermind John Allen Muhammad, 
and felt compelled to take the blame for the sniper rampage, psychologist 
Dewey Cornell testified Monday at Malvo's trial. 

Malvo's confession -- in which he claimed he was the shooter in all of last 
year's sniper shootings in metropolitan Washington that left 10 dead -- was "an 
attempt to sacrifice himself and claim credit to spare Mr. Muhammad,'' said 
Cornell, of the University of Virginia. 

"He felt responsible for their being caught by falling asleep, and he blamed 
himself for the failure of their mission,'' Cornell said. Malvo and Muhammad 
were arrested while sleeping in a car at a highway rest stop in Maryland. 

Malvo is presenting an insanity defense to capital murder charges in the Oct. 
14, 2002, slaying of FBI analyst Linda Franklin outside a Home Depot. The 
defense claims he was brainwashed by Muhammad and could no longer tell right from 
wrong. 

Cornell said that after Malvo had been indoctrinated by Muhammad, "he 
believed what he was doing was right and that John Muhammad was a chosen person of 
Allah.'' 

Cornell diagnosed Malvo with a dissociative disorder, a form of mental 
illness in which a person loses touch with reality and his own identity becomes 
distorted. Cornell gave no opinion on whether the mental disease rose to the level 
of insanity. 

"This was a very unusual, rare case,'' he said.

The dog found alive in a garbage trailer at the Edgeboro 
Landfill in East Brunswick Thursday may have cheated death by surviving an attempt to 
euthanize her, police said yesterday. 

This shepherd mix dog, discovered alive at the Edgeboro Landfill in East 
Brunswick last week, may have survived an attempted euthanization.


"We're looking into that allegation," said Perth Amboy Police Director 
Michael Kohut. 
Kohut said detective Richard Cielesz is due to report his findings today to 
the Office of Professional Standards, the Police Department's Internal Affairs 
Office, about whether the dog escaped the botched attempt at being put down by 
the city's Animal Control Office. 
He said it is accepted practice to expose of euthanized animals in the trash, 
but protocol must be followed, including placing the carcass in a 3-ply 
plastic bag. 
Kohut said the department was "confident" that the dog indeed came from the 
city pound. 
"We're trying to identify the owner of the dog and how we got it (the dog)," 
he said. 
The Middlesex County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also is 
investigating.</docText>

Rescue group hopes to adopt steer that escaped slaughter.

Dorothy Davies says she is a woman of peace, but she is waging a bizarre
battle of language, culture and principles via phone, fax and e-mail from
her Manchester Township farm.
...
It all started Dec. 2 while Davies was visiting her son, Darian, and his
wife at their home in Arizona. In a story that was publicized across the
country, an enormous 1,800-pound bull escaped from an Eastern Market
slaughterhouse and romped around Detroit?s east side for more than an hour
before being tranquilized by a veterinarian and taken into custody.

The tranquilizer bought the bull ? now called "Jefferson the Re-bull" by
Davies and her colleagues at the Shelter and Safe Haven for Animals Farms
on Mahrle Road ? two weeks of time because it cannot be slaughtered while
it has sedatives in its system.

But time is running short for Jefferson. Davies said misunderstandings in
negotiations between the farm and slaughterhouse owner Nazem Saad have
been complicated by language and cultural barriers.
...
"An action alert went out to 60,000 people last week from PETA (People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals)," she said. "He?s being besieged by
phone calls, just like I am.
...
Animal rights activists and meat eaters alike are upset by the
implications of Jefferson?s eventual slaughter. Davies and the rest of the
SASHA Farms staff are distressed because they are unable to determine what
has actually happened to the steer.</docText>

You don't need to be a vegetarian to appreciate a good fake meat menu. I 
refer not to ready-to-eat veggie hot dogs and "chicken" nuggets, but to the 
Chinese Buddhist tradition of elaborate vegetable dishes designed to resemble 
traditional meat-based fare. The "meats," commonly made from wheat gluten or soy, 
are not intended to taste just like real meat (they don't), but to look similar 
and taste good in their own right (they do). 
For vegetarians accustomed to more limited options (broccoli with garlic 
sauce or eggplant with garlic sauce), a fake meat menu is a revelation. Panda 
Garden still has its extensive regular menu, with plenty of real meat, but its 
fake meat menu is far more distinctive and intriguing. The menu includes 
vegetarian "chicken," "pork" and "beef" entr?es, with a fourth section of tofu dishes. 
For appetizers, diners must look to the regular menu, where David and I found 
steamed vegetable dumplings with a mildly spicy dipping sauce. Filled with 
greens, minced mushrooms, egg, ginger and garlic, the dumplings were tasty but 
unwieldy, with a tendency to fall apart. </docText>

Squirrels and chipmunks can be seen or heard looking for food throughout the 
forested areas of SUBASE. Their population is based on the abundance of food 
on the base, according to Andrew Stackpole, the Navy Region Northeast 
environmental program manager. 
Things that crawl, slither, and croak at Naval Submarine Base New London 
(SUBASE)? No, this isn't an advertisement for the latest horror flick at the 
Dealey Center Theater, but rather a survey of the herpetological fauna at SUBASE. 
What the heck is "herpetological fauna," one might ask? It's the reptiles 
(snakes and turtles) and amphibians (frogs and salamanders) that occupy the wilder 
areas of this facility. 
Believe it or not, SUBASE does have its wild areas, and everything from deer, 
otter, Canada geese and coyotes to seals, turkeys, hawks and foxes have been 
spotted on SUBASE. About the only things the environmental department has not 
seen are bear and moose, although those animals have been spotted just miles 
from the base.
Under Navy policy, SUBASE is required to implement an integrated Natural 
Resources Management Plan to ensure the natural resources of the base are managed 
wisely and in compliance with federal and state regulations. SUBASE New London 
teamed with a Natural Resources contractor, Dr. Joe Mitchell, to survey the 
reptiles and amphibians on the base. They have just wrapped up the field work 
for the survey, which involved a lot of night work and wading through the 
wetlands and streams. 
The survey showed that parts of SUBASE support very healthy populations of 
reptiles and amphibians. These creatures, aside from being a part of the local 
ecosystem of ponds and wetlands in the northern portions of the base, provide 
great insect and rodent control services.</docText>

A poodle mix sits in her cage at the Russellville Animal Shelter. Dozens of 
dogs and cats are available for adoption, and a new spay-and-neuter program at 
the shelter has reduced the costs associated with pet adoption.
New program saves furry lives, officials say


A new spay-and-neuter program at the Russellville Animal Shelter is saving 
more lives of its furry residents, according to city animal control officials 
and department statistical reports. 
The program, implemented this summer, led to a significant drop in the 
euthanization of cats and dogs, Russellville Animal Control Director Mike Vernon 
said. The new program is the city?s proactive attempt toward controlling the 
community?s pet overpopulation problem, he said. 
?We?ve seen a reduction in the number of animals we?ve had to put to sleep, 
and that?s a trend we like to see,? said Vernon, who is in his 17th year at 
the shelter. ?We?re serious about controlling the pet population, and we 
appreciate the support we?ve received from many of the veterinarians in our 
community. We couldn?t do it without them.? 
Participating veterinarians from Russellville and Dardanelle spay and neuter 
adaptable shelter animals for a reduced charge for the city, meaning the 
animals are already spayed and neutered when they are adopted from the shelter. 
Previously, cats and dogs would be adopted as-is, and animal control officials 
would not know if pet owners ever had their new pets spayed or neutered.

        <docText>A dozen endangered sea lions gather around two 
divers waving strange contraptions far below the ocean surface off the coast of 
Kodiak Island. 
    Brian Fadely, a federal wildlife biologist, grips a noose attached to a 
50-foot line, while colleague Kate Call wiggles a herring at the end of a short 
pole to lure one of the hefty pups through the hoop -- successfully. Another 
curious Steller sea lion is caught for science. 
    Five researchers in a skiff are ready to crate the startled 200-pound 
animal for the short ride to the research vessel Tiglax, the only ship of its 
kind among the 540 national wildlife refuges in the country. 
    Once on board the ship, scientists with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service anesthetize the 5-month old pup, glue a satellite transmitter to its 
back, then release it back to the frigid sea to be tracked over the next several 
months. 
By the end of the 17-day excursion from Kodiak to the eastern Aleutian 
Islands last month, researchers will have tagged 13 young sea lions, believed to be 
the most vulnerable age group of an endangered species off Alaska's coast. The 
ongoing juvenile tracking effort has intensified over the last few years, but 
there's always one constant -- the Tiglax. </docText>

        <docText>In his dim trailer in the pines, Virgil Butler writes
of killing.

He once shot a man to death in the parking lot of a bar. He served in the
American invasion of Panama and recalled killing enemy soldiers at close
range.

That is not the violence that drives him to his keyboard.

He is haunted, instead, by the nine years he made his way in the world by
slaughtering chickens.
...
Posted at www.cyberactivist. blogspot.com, Butler's account of a career on
the kill floor is being translated into French and Dutch. Britain's
Guardian newspaper has recommended his Web log as "powerful stuff," a
"must-read." Supporters in Singapore and Russia e-mail questions.
Strangers from across America send cards.
...
"Virgil's description of the horrible abuse of chickens in our nation's
slaughterhouses ... has turned more people vegetarian than anything else
we did last year," said Bruce Friedrich, director of vegan outreach for
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. With 750,000 members, PETA is
the largest animal rights group in the world. "We get letters and e-mails
about it constantly," Friedrich said.

Tyson dismisses Butler as a disgruntled worker who invented tales of
slaughterhouse horror only after he lost his job. "Some of the things he
says are outrageous," spokesman Ed Nicholson said. Tyson does not plan
legal action to shut down the Web site, he added, because suing would give
Butler only more publicity. Nicholson recently signed up for a chat room</docText>

        <docText>But this animal -- traditionally used by washer-men to carry bundles of 
clothes -- is fast disappearing in Jharkhand if a new animal census is to be 
believed.

The ass population in three Jharkhand districts -- Hazaribagh, Chatra and 
Koderma -- was over 100 in the last animal census that took place 20 years ago. 
But now just a dozen of them remain. 

The last census was conducted there in 1981 when Jharkhand was part of Bihar. 

The decline may have something to do with lesser interest in the animal.

"Even in rural areas of the state, few washer-men use donkeys today. Nobody 
has been bothered about breeding the animal any more. As a result, their 
numbers have declined," said an official of the animal husbandry department. 

Alarm bells are also ringing for elephants, tigers, deer and other wildlife 
in the state. 

According to animal census report, the population of elephants has come down 
from 752 to 400. The tiger population has declined to 42 from 142 and the 
cheetal deer population from 20,186 to 16,384. 

The monkey population has, however, gone up -- from 40,795 in the last 
census, it is now 64,485. The bear population too has increased from 1,102 to 1,808. 

Forest officials say tribals often kill animals as part of their traditional 
rituals.</docText>

Recent shipment of cane rat meat that came into Hartsfield-Jackson 
International Airport 
Inspectors at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport, suspicious of a smoky 
odor wafting from the suitcase of a passenger arriving from Cameroon in Central 
Africa, peered into her bag.
They were shocked by what they saw -- an entire smoked monkey. The meat, the 
woman said, was intended for a traditional wedding reception of some African 
immigrants.
"It was obviously a monkey, but we couldn't identify the species," said 
Patricia Rogers, a federal wildlife agent at the airport.
In August, two large monkey heads seized from a passenger arriving in Atlanta 
from Senegal apparently were intended for consumption by a family of 
immigrants, authorities said.
Airport inspectors from New York to Hawaii are reporting similar findings as 
a demand for "bush meat," or wild animal flesh, mostly from Africa, increases 
in the United States. "We're probably seeing only the tip of the iceberg," 
said Mike Elkins, deputy wildlife agent in charge at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's regional office in Atlanta.</docText>

On a cool, rainy afternoon, inside Philadelphia?s Wachovia Center,
children and parents crowd the cavernous hall trying to get a closer look
at Asia, the elephant who paints with her trunk. Asia is a star of the
?three-ring adventure? in the 133rd edition of the Ringling
Brothers/Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, the largest and oldest in the U.S. As
families mill about they see posters describing Ringling?s efforts to
protect endangered Asian elephants. The tagline reads: ?Endangered
species? Not if we can help it.?
...
For years, animal rights and welfare groups have been protesting
Ringling?s use of animals, particularly endangered species such as
elephants and tigers. They complain of cruel training, transport and
living conditions, and urge the public to avoid circuses that include
animal acts. Last July, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. handed
animal advocates, including the Fund for Animals and the ASPCA, a legal
victory in their efforts to hold Ringling accountable. The groups?
lawsuit, now moving forward, charges Ringling with violating the
Endangered Species Act by abusing elephants through routine circus
practices (using bullhooks, chaining them for long periods, and weaning
baby elephants too young).

A growing number of cities are banning circuses with animal acts, and
activists are not convinced that Ringling has changed. The lives of
elephants born at the CEC ?will be filled with chains and bullhooks,?
charges Debbie Leahy, director of captive and exotic animals for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). ?The fact that wild
populations are still dwindling is proof enough that what they?re doing
isn?t doing a darn bit of good.?</docText>

the CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES (CITES)
concerning MR. Abu Hassan  aka  Professor Assan and his Amazing Animals 
E-mail: CITESENFORCEMENT@cites.org
 
DEAR CITES - 

Please stop the animal mistreatment and smuggling activities of 
Abu Hassan, doing business as Professor Assan and his Amazing Animals
in Africa.

Conditions at this circus are appalling.  Animals are locked in 
cages too small for them.  They trap also wild animals and sell them 
to overseas buyers.  They smuggle chimps and parrots. THIS HAPPENS
EVERYWHERE THEY PERFORM!!!


Yours Sincerely,

KGB agents in scuba gear used to swim under Nikita Khrushchev's boat, putting 
fish on his hook. They used to chain wild boars to trees so Leonid Brezhnev 
could blast them with his hunting rifle; they used to hide behind trees to 
throw furry little rabbits out for Brezhnev to peer at through his thick 
eyeglasses and gun down.

Which brings us to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, who took Air Force Two 
last week to an exclusive Pennsylvania club for some sport -- Brezhnev-style. 
No boars chained to trees, no trembling pages clutching trembling rabbits to 
chuck like grenades into the line of fire. Just hundreds of clueless, 
farm-raised ring-necked pheasants, all held under nets until the vice president and 
his Texas Republican friends (investment bankers, a senator, former Dallas 
Cowboys football star Roger Staubach) are in position.
Then the nets are lifted, the birds started and the gunfire opened. Cheney 
bagged more than 70; hundreds all told were killed. A senator who participated 
joked it was more like working at a poultry-processing plant than hunting. An 
outdoor writer compared it to "going to the grocery store and buying chicken." 
Animal rights activists called it slaughter for fun. The editor of Field &amp; 
Stream shrugged, "I don't think it should be confused with hunting."
But whether it's Cheney or Chernomyrdin, hunting this way is quick. Cheney's 
birds were plucked and vacuum-packed in time for his flight that afternoon to 
Washington (where, the official story goes, they were given to the poor). 
Cheney had no comment for the press, but you could easily imagine him echoing 
Chernomyrdin: "I was happy that I had an opening in my schedule for this. I 
love hunting. There is no other recreation that I can afford. I am always short 
of time."</docText>

        <docText>Alberta's rivers have undergone a first-ever, exhaustive round of 
drug-testing this year as Alberta Environment tries to find out whether 
pharmaceuticals, cleaning products and cosmetics are polluting our water.
The department tested river water above and below Edmonton, Red Deer, Calgary 
and Lethbridge.
Its Water Research Users Group wanted to look at the cities' drinking water 
resources and at the outflow from municipal sewage treatment plants, said 
Robert Moyles, a department spokesman.
"The pharmaceuticals in water are not something we know a lot about," he 
said. "We certainly need to supplement our knowledge of what the impacts might be 
and if we need to take steps to address those."
On the test list are: antibiotics, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, caffeine, 
nicotine, steroids, human growth hormones, testosterone, estrogen and key indicators 
of cosmetics and cleaning products.
A study published this year by the United States Geological Survey showed 80 
per cent of 139 streams across the U.S. had everything from steroids to 
disinfectants in them.
This news hit the toxicology community "like lightning," said Alice Hontela, 
an ecotoxicologist at the University of Lethbridge and a member of the 
recently formed provincial Water Research Centre.
"The big question is what do they do to humans and animals who drink the 
water that is not treated to remove these chemicals," Hontela said.
A study released this fall showed fish in Texas carried traces of Prozac, a 
popular antidepressant, in their organs. This could affect their ability to 
survive, the study suggested.</docText>

        <docText>The brain keeps track of the movements it makes so as
to process sensory input accurately and coordinate
complex movements gracefully. In this chapter we
review the brain's strategies for keeping track of
fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is
by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or
corollary discharges. It has been difficult to
identify corollary discharge signals in the primate
brain, although in some studies the influence of
corollary discharge, for example on visual processing,
has been found. We propose four criteria for
identifying corollary discharge signals in primate
brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from
superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through
mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the
prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate
from a brain structure involved in generating
movements. Second, they must begin just prior to
movements and represent spatial attributes of the
movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not
impair movements in simple tasks not requiring
corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals
should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that
require corollary discharge, such as a double-step
task in which the monkey must keep track of one
saccade in order to correctly generate another.
Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior
colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it
does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The
extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these
signals, particularly in the realm of sensory
perception, remains unknown pending further studies.
Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem
to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys,
and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge
signals.

A Dec. 9 story in the Main News section about a Web log written by 
animal-rights activist Virgil Butler contained several errors. The article, from the Los 
Angeles Times, said Butler took part in the U.S. invasion of Panama, where he 
recalled killing enemy soldiers, but the Army has no record of his service. 
The article stated that Butler shot a man to death in the parking lot of a bar 
and went to prison for manslaughter. In fact, he was convicted of felony 
burglary, and the shooting could not be confirmed. The article said Butler killed 
80,000 birds a shift at a Tyson poultry plant. He did not slaughter every 
chicken personally but was part of a nine-person team.
In his blog, Butler also claims he saw his co-workers at a Tyson plant in 
Grannis rip the heads off live chickens, stomp them to death and blow them up 
with dry-ice bombs.

Polk County Sheriff Michael Oglesby investigated the allegations but found no 
proof. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also looked into the claims but 
"could not substantiate them," spokesman Steven Cohen said.

Neither the word "bikini" nor "barbecue" springs to mind, but here I am at
a place called the Lucky 13 Art Studio out on Bayou St. John, about to
witness a vivid underground spectacle called "Sweet Meat," in which local
performance/conceptual artist Heather Weathers will weave a bikini out of
freshly butchered red meat, model it and then grill and serve it to her
audience.
...
For the last performance of Sweat Meat (this is the 13th show since its
inception), Weathers got regular flank steak from Sam's Club in Kenner and
she invited the guy in the bloody apron behind the counter to her
performance and he said he'd come but, well . . . she didn't see him there
that night.
...
"I use the idea of a meat bikini to present this idea in a simple
non-intellectual form. It allows the viewer to experience the animal
instinct of attraction and repulsion. I am interested in the dichotomy of
the live skin and dead flesh . . .The performance is a ritual. I am able
to exchange these ideas by offering them to the audience. It is your
choice to partake or not of the flesh."
...
As Weathers disrobes from her gown and applies her meat bikini, she says:
"The texture of red meat is very surreal -- soft, supple and wet." The
photographers move in.

She says: "I'm very sensitive to the fact that I'm wearing something dead." 
...
She offers me some. She is a vegetarian. That's what I choose to be at
this moment. Besides, there's no horseradish.</docText>

        <docText>Japan and South Korea took action to halt imports of U.S.
beef on Wednesday after a cow in Washington state tested positive for mad
cow disease.

Japan's Agriculture Ministry said the country was indefinitely banning
beef imports, depriving American exporters of their largest overseas market.

In Seoul, South Korea, the government halted customs inspection of U.S.
beef, a move that effectively keeps U.S. beef from reaching its domestic
market.

The suspensions came less than four hours after the U.S. government
announced that a Holstein cow on a Washington state farm tested positive
for mad cow disease, marking the disease's first suspected appearance in
the United States.

The Bush administration on Tuesday tried to reassure Americans their food
is safe. 
...
Mad cow disease, known also as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats
holes in the brains of cattle. It sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread
through countries in Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of
herds and decimating the European beef industry. 
...
With an election year approaching, the news alarmed some in Congress. Rep.
Tim Holden, D-Pa., a member of the House Agriculture Committee, said he
expected Congress to hold "extensive oversight" hearings when lawmakers
return to Washington in late January.

Lawmakers are keenly aware that a case of mad cow disease in Canada last
May ? which officials described as a single, isolated incident ? still had
devastating economic consequences.

"If it's anything like what happened in Canada, it will be bad. The
problem won't be that people will stop eating meat in the United States;
the problem is the exports will be shut down like we did with Canada,"
said Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn. </docText>

        <docText>The market for U.S. beef exports
effectively shut down on Wednesday as fallout from the first case of mad
cow disease in the United States widened and public health investigators
combed a tiny Washington state hamlet to find the cause of the potentially
fatal disease.

Japan, Mexico and South Korea, the top three markets for U.S. beef
exports, banned imports after it was disclosed that a single 4-year-old
Holstein cow tested positive for the brain-wasting disease, a discovery
that threatened the $27 billion U.S. cattle industry.
...
Verns Moses Lake Meats, a small slaughter company in Washington state,
recalled more than 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of raw beef due to concerns
the products may contain meat tainted with mad cow disease.
...
A tissue sample was flown by U.S. military jet to an animal laboratory in
Britain for additional confirmation. Those results will not be ready for
three to five days.
...
After a recent boom that saw many Americans return to beef amid a craze
for protein-rich diets, some consumers said it might be time to rethink
their eating habits yet again.

"This catastrophe might open some eyes to the many problems with
meat-heavy diets," said Amy Joy Lanou, an official of the consumer health
group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. The group offers a
vegetarian starter kit for suddenly fearful carnivores.

        <docText>Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry on 
Sunday proposed several changes to the system of monitoring livestock in 
response to the discovery of mad cow disease in the United States. 
Kerry's plan calls for a national tracking system, a sharp increase in the 
testing of cattle for the disease and an unspecified level of financial aid to 
farmers who stand to suffer as a result of the discovery.

Howard Dean, also campaigning in Iowa, called on the Department of 
Agriculture to implement immediately a number of measures to restore confidence in the 
U.S. beef industry.
Since the announcement that a now-slaughtered Holstein cow from Washington 
state was sick with mad cow disease, more than two dozen countries have halted 
imports of U.S. beef, valued at $3.4 billion a year.
"The current mad cow investigation underscores the urgent need for a national 
system to make diseased livestock easier to track and contain," Kerry, a 
Massachusetts senator, said in a statement.
Kerry said downed animals those too sick or injured to stand or walk 
unassisted that are being tested for the disease should not be processed until the 
results are known.</docText>

- It might seem quiet to the person walking by.

Make laps around the track in Roosevelt Park and you might hear a scream or a 
wail. No, there is not a grand party inside.

The language of the animal world, however, has been subdued because its 
audience has chosen to do other things. The Roosevelt Park Zoo is closed to the 
public during the winter, but life goes on inside. There are just no spectators. 
Workers do make sure the inmates don't get too lonely.

Just don't get too close to that cage or that gibbon, the ape without a tail. 
It might take a swipe. Right now, it's stretched out along the bars. Anything 
to reduce the boredom. Or maybe it just does want to take that swipe. 
Something to reduce the boredom. Or maybe it's just seeking the attention of today's 
guests with the ones from summer gone.

Most animals are inside for the year. You would think the penguins would be 
out skidding on ice. But they're black-footed penguins, pansies who are from a 
patch of islands off the tip of South Africa. They want warmth.

Robert Wright had planned
what he would do
if the
Grand Prix
Fire came
near his
creekside
house.
The veteran dog rescuer had already secured a           promise of temporary shelter for himself and
his 12  dogs at a
Korean  mission just down  the road.
                       
But at 10 a.m. on Oct. 25, with an out-of-control backfire twisting in  the hills above his house, the flames were moving  too fast. As Wright scrambled to organize the dogs
for a backwoods dash to the mission, Kern County
firefighters rushed into the neighborhood and told
him to get out.

                       "I told the fire gentlemen I'm not going nowhere without those dogs," Wright said. "They loaded the whole crew into a fire truck."
                       Sheltered from flames inside a circle of cleared ground at the mission, Wright, his dogs and five cats weathered the fire. One of his dogs crawled under a
utility truck and gave birth to a litter of six puppies. 

By 11 a.m., Wright's home had burned to the
ground. He and his dogs have lived at the Lytle
Creek Calvary Pentecostal Church since the fire.
Wright, 58, has lived 14 years in Lytle Creek and
has rescued dogs other people dump in a mountain
canyon since the early 1990s. He began helping
former Lytle Creek resident Roseanne Abrams with
her animal rescue in 1995. When Abrams moved to
Idaho in 1997, Wright took over the rescue alone.

"He would die for those animals. He's a very simple
man, a man of simple means, but he's got the heart,"
Abrams said.

LONG Update, answers to some questions, and what we
 will need in terms of
 
 supplies.
 
 ChicagoLand German Shepherd Rescue is the rescue
 under whose license
 these 
 dogs are being pulled, cared for and placed.
 Maribeth is the 
 president/founder. But as you can imagine, she is
 swamped! See below for 
 contact info &amp; details.
 
 1. Media. Chicago Ridge Animal Welfare League is
 being very careful and 
 working with a specific reporter who has been
 supportive in the past. 
 Please do not publicize anything per se. Let the
 rescuer's handle it as 
 there are reasons for caution just now.
 
 2. Update. The last count was around 200 dogs. Seems
 there were probably 
 about 300 total. Just yesterday, they were able to
 get into the building.
 
 Before now, they were dealing only with the dogs on
 the outside.
 
 3. WE NEED:
 CRATES
 BOWLS
 COLLARS
 LEATHER LEASHES (nylon will be hard on the handler
 as these dogs are
 large 
 yet completely untrained).
 MONEY (see below for donation options) The bills
 will be high due to
 needed 
 veterinary care.
 FOOD: Adult or Lg Puppy formulas only! Please, NO
 regular puppy food!
 These 
 dogs are at starvation level and it will overwhelm
 their tummies. Right 
 now, they are being fed a tablespoon or two every
 hour until their
 stomachs 
 can start to function again. Also, no Eukanuba
 please as it is too rich. 
 Eukanuba Sr might work though.
 
 4. Kira is heading up fundraising. With support from
 Peter Johnson of 
 ChicagoLand GSD Rescue. See below for contact
 details.
 As we come up with fundraising ideas, I will send
 out updates.
 
 5. FINANCIAL DONATIONS can be made as follows:
 PayPal:  (there's a link on the home
 page - right side. Has 
 puppies in the picture)
 e-mail address for PayPal 
 Checks: Send checks to:
 
 FOSTER HOMES/ADOPTION:
 Contact ChicagoLand GSD Rescue!
 Foster/adoption forms are available on their website
 
 6. DONATIONS OF HARD GOODS: Crates, bowls, leashes,
 collars, food.
 (Crates 
 can be on loan also: in that case, if at all
 possible please find a way
 to 
 attach your name andphone number to the crate. A key
 ring/tag works
 well.)
 Contact Kira and Peter to arrange delivery/pick up
 of these items.

        <docText>Rep. Richard Gephardt has been searching for just the right issue to bring
down his arch-rival in the Democratic presidential race, Howard Dean. First,
he criticized the former Vermont governor for trying to cut Medicare,
welfare benefits, and aid to the elderly and blind. Then he hit Dean for his
alleged lack of foreign policy experience.
But wait until Gephardt rolls out the "leg-trap" issue, bashing Dean for his
support for the contraptions used to hunt animals. At a breakfast with
reporters earlier this month, Steve Murphy, Gephardt's campaign manager,
described the leg-trap issue as a potent political weapon that could cripple
(pun intended) Dean in California and New York, where apparently the
campaign believes the animal-rights vote is strong.
"It's been a huge issue in a number of states," Murphy said. "And obviously
it's a visually compelling issue," he added, hinting at an ad campaign
featuring helpless furry creatures caught in the jaws of traps.

Before the ink even dried on Wyoming's wolf management plan, it was greeted 
by a chorus of howls. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service voiced strong 
concerns that the plan would not provide adequate assurances to prevent 
wolves from becoming threatened again. Neighboring political leaders, such 
as Montana Gov. Judy Martz, admonished Wyoming to create a more balanced 
plan so as not to delay the transition of wolf management to all three 
Northern Rocky states.


Expert criticism
Conservationists also believed that the Wyoming plan was too aggressive by 
allowing the immediate shooting of wolves. And this past week, in a process 
called "peer review" (a step in the wolf delisting process), a group of 
federal, state, and academic wolf experts from all over the country added 
themselves to the chorus of concern about Wyoming's wolf management plan.


As part of the endangered species delisting process, Wyoming agreed that it 
would not rely on Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks to support all 
of its wolves, and be committed to maintaining a minimum of seven wolf packs 
outside of these protected areas. Yet under Wyoming's current plan, the Game 
and Fish Department has authority to regulate wolf killing only within the 
wilderness areas adjacent to the national parks-which covers just 10 percent 
of the wolves' range outside of the national parks. Across the rest of 
Wyoming, wolves would be classified as a "predatory" animal, meaning that 
wolves can be killed anytime, by anyone. Given these parameters, it is 
questionable whether Wyoming could maintain seven wolf packs outside the 
protected areas.


Not surprisingly, seven out of the 11 peer-review experts expressed concerns 
regarding Wyoming's management plan. Some specifically addressed the 
"predatory" classification across most of Wyoming: "This seems like an 
extreme form of wolf management," said the lead wolf biologist and manager 
for Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

    A federal judge's decision to ban snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand 
Teton national parks is a victory for those who rightly believe that our 
national parks should be protected from polluters so that all Americans can 
enjoy their beauty.
    U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington, D.C., was wise to halt 
action by the National Park Service to reverse a Clinton-era rule that would 
gradually remove the noisy, exhaust-spewing machines from the parks over two 
years.
    The snowmobile industry lobbied the Park Service long and hard to get 
the ban overturned, arguing that snowmobile riders have a right to motor 
through Yellowstone and that manufacturers could produce less-polluting 
machines.
    The Park Service argued that allowing 950 snowmobilers a day in 
Yellowstone and 400 in Grand Teton would balance the agency's dual mission 
of protecting the park while allowing visitors to use it.
    None of those arguments swayed the judge, who deftly cut to the core of 
the debate in noting that the Park Service's primary job, "rarely . . . 
trumped by other considerations," is to conserve the pristine natural beauty 
of the parks.
    The air and noise pollution from snowmobiles are unkind to national 
parks and to all the people who manage to see them without ruining the 
experience for others. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a 
single, unregulated two-stroke snowmobile engine can emit as much pollution 
as nearly 100 automobiles. Models that manufacturers said would emit fewer 
pollutants have turned out to be more powerful and sometimes even dirtier 
and noisier.
    Americans who want their national parks to remain places of natural 
beauty and tranquility oppose snowmobile traffic. More than 90 percent of 
the public opinion gathered by the Interior Department during the last 
comment period was against allowing snowmobiles in Yellowstone. Four former 
Park Service directors who served under both Republican and Democratic 
presidents urged Interior to enforce the ban.
    Those who say the ban limits winter park access to skiers and snowshoers 
are ignoring the continuing operation of snow coaches that carry 10 people 
at a time. Coach passengers -- including the elderly, families and those 
with disabilities -- can view scenery not enshrouded in a polluted haze and 
watch animals not bothered by the noise from hundreds of snomobiles.
    And it's not as if the ban would eliminate the machines from hundreds of 
miles of snowmobile trails just outside the parks.
    National parks should be accessible to all, but granting special access 
to snowmobilers destroys important qualities the parks were created to 
protect. So they must go.

Thanks to all of your kind hearts we have taken over half of the piggy angels 
off the tree. With a few days yet to go we are hoping they will All be 
chosen!  What lucky piggies to have such friends.
 
With snow on the ground and the thermometer sitting at 20 degrees this 
morning I am glad that everyone here has a warm bed.. with so much hay they can lose 
themselves in it.. We put out about 30 bales last weekend and yesterday I put 
out another 40. 
 
If you know of any pigs who do not have a suitable house or bedding please 
email .. we will try to get some help to them. There are several organizations 
now who are doing the Helping Hoof program so when you see pigs in need email 
me and I will pass it along to Tammy or Lana or whomever might be closest. And 
any sanctuary will help a pig in need.. it doesn't have to have a formal 
program.. What we couldn't dream of doing alone, together we make happen every 
day.... just for the love of pigs. And all of you who are part of the Helping Hoof 
program are the reason it works.. may you find a special joy in your heart 
this Christmas, knowing that some pig somewhere is safe because of your caring..

If you really want to understand mad cow disease, just think of sex and
AIDS, the eternity of nuclear waste and playing the lottery.

Now add a hamburger patty to the mix, and grind it all together.

Want to take a bite out of that?

I understand if you don't. So why don't we hear many government or
beef-industry officials talking candidly about what's really at play with
the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spinning so hard on how mad
cow won't touch you, it's clear the agency is more concerned with the beef
industry than it is in your well being. 
...
My wife works for PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and
is considered the resident mad cow expert there.

She's been warning me about mad cow for years.

Fortunately, I became a vegetarian when we got married years ago, so I
don't have to deal with an "I told you so." 
...
The whole thing is timed perfectly to help you ring in the new year with a
real 2004 resolution: Go vegetarian! (You haven't heard of mad carrot
disease, have you?)

What cholesterol and heart disease haven't done to push you over the top,
perhaps mad cow will.

At least, get to know your meat with the same precaution you use with a
potential sex partner.

Eating meat can be just as deadly as sex. And it's definitely more fattening.

        <docText>There is a story about a disgruntled farm wife who could never
be satisfied and she was known to put a slant on situations to gain
sympathy. Unhappy with her son who farmed on 50/50 shares with her, she
told family members, "He got a whole cow to butcher and I only got half a
cow. He is robbing me."

Not thinking through what she said, the family was furious at this son for
robbing his mother. Finally, someone woke up and asked, "What happened to
the other half of your cow?" The farm wife knew she had been caught and
sheepishly had to admit she didn?t need a whole cow and had sold the other
half.

In the fast pace we live, we choose not to take the time to "think" about
what we hear or read. We jump to our own conclusions based on the media
spin that forms the thoughts of the nation not thinking to question what
happened to the "other half."

What really causes BSE? Apparently no one knows for certain. Most believe
it is from the feed supplement. However, Mark Purdy, an organic dairy
farmer from Somerset, England has a different theory.

Purdy refused to spray his cattle with organophosphates, a chemical
required by the British government to be used to fight the warble fly.
Purdy went to court to challenge the order and he was exempted from using
the spray on his farm. BSE was not found in Purdy?s herd. Purdy studied
the disease when it hit England and argues that mad cow disease is not
caused by a virus but is a result of organophospate pesticides and toxic
mineral overload.

Purdy believes the combination of milk replacer given calves and
organophosphates used to spray the cattle for the warble fly creates a
combination that produces extreme accumulations of manganese in the brain.

The Ballarat North woman was one of 22 residents and families who opened 
their hearts and their homes to abandoned dogs and cats at the Ballarat branch of 
the RSPCA over the past two days.

"I was planning to get a kitten for a while, and then I saw the story in the 
paper and thought I would come down straight away," Ms Foster said.

The RSPCA was inundated with a record number of animal lovers wanting to 
claim a pet after an article in Saturday's edition of The Courier revealed the sad 
post-Christmas dumping of two silver kittens abandoned at Victoria Park on 
Christmas Day just 100m from the shelter.

In a sad twist, the two kittens were euthanased yesterday because they were 
infected with the highly contagious cat flu.

"They didn't have a good start to life to be honest," RSPCA centre manager 
Rob Brown said.

But despite the loss, 11 cats and 11 dogs had been taken off death row and 
given a new lease on life - because of the kittens' plight, he said.</docText>

When Sheldon Rampton and I wrote our 1997 book, "Mad Cow USA: Could the
Nightmare Happen Here?", it received favorable reviews from some
interesting publications such as the Journal of the American Medical
Association, New Scientist, and Chemical &amp; Engineering News. Yet although
the book was released just before the infamous Texas trial of Oprah
Winfrey and her guest Howard Lyman, for the alleged crime of "food
disparagement," the book was ignored by the mainstream media, and even
most left and alternative publications failed to review it.

Apparently many people who never read it at the time bought the official
government and industry spin that mad cow disease was just some hysterical
European food scare, not a deadly human and animal disease that could
emerge in America.
...
... Our activism won us some interesting enemies, such as Richard Berman,
a Republican lobbyist who runs an industry-funded front group that calls
itself The Center for Consumer Freedom. Berman is a darling of the
tobacco, booze, biotech and food industries, and with their funding he
issued an online report depicting us as the ring leaders of a dangerous
conspiracy of vegetarian food terrorists out to destroy the United States
food system. Last week alone he issued two national news releases
attempting to smear us.
...
Our book, "Mad Cow USA," is temporarily unavailable until a paperback copy
is released later in 2004. However, you can get the book in its entirety
for free through the website of our Center for Media &amp; Democracy. Simply
go to www.prwatch.org and click on the cover of "Mad Cow USA." You'll be
taken to www.prwatch.org/books/mcusa.pdf where you can download for free
the entire book ? and read the warnings that went unheeded then, and are
still being ignored by government regulators and industry.

When Carmen Gale's 6-year-old twins return to school following winter
break, they'll be packing lunch if beef's on the school menu.

The Poulsbo mother made the decision to remove beef from her family's diet
following news of the country's first case of mad-cow disease. 
...
Though the USDA, cattle ranchers and state and federal officials assert
that there is little threat to humans, some consumers are nonetheless
cutting red meat from their diets and exploring meat alternatives such as
organic foods and vegetarian meals.

At the Gale household, steak, ground beef and London broil were served at
the dinner table two to three times a week, in addition to the occasional
stop for burgers at McDonald's. But concerns over the safety of red meat
mean a diet without it ? for good.

"My problem is the big unknown," Gale said. "Nobody can say for certain
that it's safe." 
...
Rachel Bjork, co-coordinator of Northwest Animal Rights Network (NARN), a
Seattle-based animal activist group, wasn't surprised by the news of
mad-cow disease in the U.S.

"It was pretty much a matter of time. The food that they feed the animals
is not in any shape or form natural," Bjork said. "For the USDA to say
there is no worry is ludicrous."

While NARN advocates a vegan diet, Bjork said people should consider the
origins of the food they eat and consider alternatives to meat.

Vegetarians eat a diet free of meat, fish and poultry, but may consume
dairy products and eggs. Vegans avoid all animal products, including eggs
and dairy.

"We feel that the vegan diet is ideal, but we also realize that for a lot
of people it takes a while" to adapt to, she said. "We are happy if people
just reduce their meat consumption. If we have 100 people reduce their
meat consumption by 10 percent, that's going to save a lot of animals."

When word flashed to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association last week that the first case of mad cow disease in the United States had been found on the West Coast, it was a red alert for an industry that had spent years playing down the threat. 

The association and its allies have spent millions in recent years to deploy lobbyists defending its interests on meat regulations, inheritance taxes and other issues. So when a crisis surfaced that struck directly at beef sales, it had a plan.

Washington lobbyists began tracking down members of Congress, who were home for the holidays, and discussing the response with officials at the Agriculture Department. Teams of experts in all 50 states were made available to the news media to get out the group's message. And the association posted a Web page, created years ago but held in reserve, to educate the public. 

"We were trying to get to the American consumer, where all our money comes from," said Chandler Keys, the association's vice president for government affairs.

The initial response was the first line of defense for an industry facing the largest test of its clout in years. It then embraced regulations imposed by the Agriculture Department on Tuesday, including an about-face on a provision the industry had long opposed and had defeated in the House earlier this year.

"Their barn is burning down," said Howard Lyman, a former rancher and lobbyist for the National Farm Union who is now an advocate for tighter regulations and a critic of the industry. "They are trying to put the best face on it."

--------------------------------  skip ------------------------------------. 

Critics of the industry say it was backed into a corner. 

"They are on the run now," said Marion Nestle, who will step down as chairman of the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University in 2004 after 15 years. "Countries all over the world are saying they will not buy their meat. That's serious."

The association, which is more than 100 years old, represents most American cattle producers, as well as others associated with the beef industry, including restaurants and grocers. It has a long history of opposition to what it calls excessive government regulation.

"One of our philosophies is minimal government involvement and letting the industry address these things," Terry Stokes, the association's chief executive, said. "More regulation increases costs and makes it difficult for small- and medium-size producers to comply."

The association contends that the system in place to detect and guard against mad cow disease is effective, that this week's new regulations were an added precaution, and that anything new should be weighed critically. Officials often say any changes should be backed by science, though the industry and its critics often draw different conclusions from the available research. 

"We want to make sure that anything we do has a practical and real effect," Mr. Keys said. "We don't want to do things that are window dressing and political posturing. When you succumb to that kind of thing, it always bites you."

Whether it can maintain that stance amid the threat of Congressional hearings, legislation and other forms of oversight remains to be seen. Like many heavily regulated sectors, the cattle industry has strong ties to government, particularly to Republicans.

Cattle and livestock interests have given almost $22 million to political campaigns since the 1990 elections, with three-quarters going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance. 

Many say the relationship improved with the election of President Bush, who is the former governor of Texas, the top cattle-producing state, and owns a ranch there. Mr. Bush was the top recipient of campaign money from the industry in his 2000 election and again this year, as well as from allies like the dairy and meat processing industries.

"I love those cattlemen!" Mr. Bush said when he met the association's president, Eric Davis, at a White House Christmas party, the association's newsletter says. Its Web site has a picture of the president at an industry conference.

Mr. Keys said the association itself traditionally steers clear of the risk involved in presidential contributions, lest it back the wrong candidate. But he says his organization is firm in its support for Mr. Bush and the Republican Party.

Critics of the industry, as well as those who have opposed it on issues, say it has been ruthlessly effective at knocking down or weakening regulation over the years. "They are able to exert a lot of pressure," Ms. Nestle said. "They are a very important American industry." 

Consumer organizations and animal rights groups that have supported proposals before the Agriculture Department and other agencies say they find themselves out-numbered by industry opponents. In Congress, lawmakers who have proposed legislation to regulate the industry say they felt the full weight of the industry's support.

So it was for Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York, who lost a battle to pass a measure to eliminate cattle that cannot walk from the food supply, the very measure the Agriculture Department implemented this week with the industry's blessing.

In the predawn at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in northeastern South Africa, 
Micaela Szykman stands on a hill with an antenna held in the air, listening for 
signals from the radio collars of African wild dogs. 
If the dogs are within range, Szykman jumps back into her jeep to rendezvous 
with them before they awake. Szykman, a research fellow of the Smithsonian 
National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., is tracking the dogs for the 
Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Predator Project. 
The African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, also called the painted wolf or the Cape 
hunting dog is the victim mainly of human persecution. The dog is listed as 
threatened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Lycaon pictus once roamed 
most of sub-Saharan Africa. Now only about 5,000 dogs can be found in isolated 
pockets. 
  

 
In 1914, game hunter R. C. F. Maugham wrote, "It will be an excellent day ? 
when means can be devised ? for this unnecessary creature's complete 
extermination." The maligned African wild dog, which kills by disemboweling, has been 
driven close to extinction. Now efforts are in place to resurrect the species.</docText>

  Stories: Animal
There were no reindeer outside the Loblolly Treasures Christmas Shop, near 
Woodside, during the holidays. 
The two reindeer that had lived at the family-operated farm and business have 
died. 
One, Holly Berry, died several months after she escaped from her owners just 
before Christmas 2002 and led pursuers on a chase through central Kent County. 
The pregnant, 250-pound animal and her unborn fawn were found dead in late 
March. 
The family's second reindeer, a young male named Sebastian, died four months 
after that. His owners think he died from lack of companionship. 
"He needed his mate," owner Cheryl Epps said. The family tried to comfort 
Sebastian by having him visit with other animals, including goats, sheep and 
horses, but he stopped eating and started losing weight. They also tried to buy 
another reindeer, but none could be delivered in time. 
Epps said that despite the loss, she is not giving up. A new pair of reindeer 
are on order, a male and a female, which will be delivered this month. 
Epps said she hopes eventually to have a herd at her store. "I want a whole 
family of reindeer like Santa," Epps said.

We the people are a strange lot.

We smoke cigarettes bought in a package bearing a health warning on every
pack.

We travel 80 miles an hour in 55 mile per hour speed zones, sometimes
while talking on a cell phone or eating. 
...
So why is the fact that one cow, apparently brought from Canada some three
years ago that has tested positive for a rare disease, created such
discussion? It's talk about a disease that over the course of 17 years may
have caused the death of 143 people worldwide.

Certainly the talk is not from the fear that the disease known as Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow will kill us dead tonight,
tomorrow or next week. Maybe it's because an offspring of that malady,
called variant Creutzfelt-Jakob disease (CJD), could cause problems a
dozen years from now.

More probably we're concerned because we fear the unknown. 
...
Who is a BSE expert? Certainly not the people offering opinions on talk
shows and in news stories. Being an expert or authority should at least
involve more than providing an opinion or writing a book.

It's too early to tell the impact on dairy farmers although Jefferson
auctioneer Bill Stade reports outstanding prices at two recent dairy sales
(Saturday and Monday).

Maybe one should worry more about driving to the supermarket than about
eating beef. Or riding a bicycle 20 miles as I did Sunday. Just consider
the odds.

Walk into Waukesha County Sheriff and Genesee Depot resident Dan Trawicki's 
office and you'll notice right away what his biggest hobby is: hunting. 


A large stuffed turkey faces the doorway, puffed out in all its splendor and 
inviting you to take a look at all the pictures adorning the wall next to it: 
pictures of Trawicki and relatives with turkeys, ducks, deer and fish, all 
freshly killed or caught.

This is a relatively normal sight for anyone who's lived in Wisconsin for 
more than a few years. Hunting? Yeah, sure, old hat, right?

That's when you might turn around.

On the opposite wall hang several pictures featuring Trawicki again smiling 
next to his prey, yet the animals are decidedly different. Lions, elephants, 
rhinoceroses and impalas are all there, next to him in each shot, inanimate 
trophies. It seems that Trawicki is a bit more into hunting than your average guy.

"I'm a big hunter - our family's a big hunter - I'm a big shooter," Trawicki 
said, while proudly showing a picture of his daughter Abby, a 10-year-old 
fourth-grader at Rose Glen Elementary, next to a wildebeest she shot in Africa. 
"She likes to hunt. She likes to shoot."</docText>

It never ceases to amaze me. 
Spend several months on an investigation into a crooked priest or an expos? 
on a creep who ran the biggest prostitution ring in Canada and in the end 
you'll get maybe two or three e-mails at the most. 
Write about a man's love for his disabled dog and his reluctance to put the 
animal down, and the electronic floodgates break open with dozens of e-mails 
praising mankind, dogkind and even the writer kind. 
Such has been the response to my column in last Saturday's Star about Greg 
Clarke and his German shepherd, Caleb, who suffers from degenerative myelopathy, 
the canine equivalent of multiple sclerosis. 
The story noted how Greg took to carrying Caleb around in a special harness a 
year ago after the disease took away the use of his hind legs. Greg recently 
purchased a doggie wheelchair for Caleb, giving the animal increased mobility, 
but Caleb is clearly living on borrowed time. 
"Caleb will let me know when it's time," Greg says of his constant companion 
for the past 11 years.

I know how emotionally attached people get to their pets.</docText>

We bond easily with deer. They are shy and beautiful, untamed yet docile. 
Deer are graceful denizens of the Western wilderness into which we carve our 
cities. 

Yet few creatures can do more damage to a well-tended landscape. It's no 
surprise, then, that gardeners who discover Bambi in the backyard are usually less 
than charmed. 

Most of the year, foothills neighbors compare notes about what the deer are 
eating this week. By winter, though, when wild food is diminished, hungry deer 
eat almost any plant they can reach, and otherwise gentle people start trading 
recipes for venison. 

They've tried to discourage them. Pitched noisy fits. Sprayed the plants with 
putrid potions. Festooned the garden with bars of soap and bags of human 
hair. Called them hurtful names such as "pigs on stilts" and "rats in high heels." 
The deer invariably run for cover, but they always return. 

After all, it is their neighborhood and, to browsing deer, a cultivated 
garden offers nothing less than haute cuisine.</docText>

        <docText>Genetic markers commonly found in modern humans all over the world 
could be evidence that our earliest ancestors were cannibals, according to 
new research. Scientists suggest that even today many of us carry a gene 
that evolved as protection against brain diseases that can be spread by 
eating human flesh.
The brain diseases, called prion diseases, are characterized by loss of 
coordination, dementia, paralysis, and eventually death. Modern examples 
include Creutzfeld Jacob disease and kuru in humans, and mad cow disease, or 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in animals.


An Iwan warrior in Papua, New Guinea wears his native dress, including a 
bone through his nose, a reminder that his tribe were once cannibals.




Fried human, barbecued human, broiled human, raw human&#x2026;were these items on 
the menu of the day for our prehistoric ancestors? Quite possibly, according 
to genetic researchers.

Scientists from England, Australia, and Papua New Guinea say that 
cannibalism is the most likely explanation for their discovery that genes 
protecting against brain diseases that can be contracted by eating 
contaminated flesh have long been spread throughout the world.

A growing body of evidence, such as piles of human bones with clear signs of 
human butchery, suggests cannibalism was widespread among ancient cultures. 
The discovery of this genetic resistance, which shows signs of having spread 
as a result of natural selection, supports the physical evidence for 
cannibalism, say the scientists.</docText>

        <docText>It's an hour before daylight, the sun is a violet haze on the 
horizon, and Shawn Olague is barreling down a dusty road in his truck, deep 
inside the Los Banos Wildlife Area. 
Suddenly, he kills the lights. 
"You can't let them see you coming," he says sharply. 
For Olague, a four-year veteran of the California Department of Fish and 
Game, the pre-dawn morning is a race against the clock. There are dozens of 
hunters already hidden in the grassland marsh, which stretches for miles in every 
direction and is one of the most popular areas for duck hunters each fall. 

 Olague jumps out of his truck and looks at the horizon. The sun won't be up 
for another 40 minutes, but hunters are allowed to start shooting at 
"safe-light," which on this day is 6:20 a.m. 
Wearing a brown camouflage jacket and hat, Olague rumbles down a dirt road on 
foot. At 6:08, shotgun blasts in the distance break the silence. 
Olague stops in his tracks and cranes his neck toward the blasts. 
Did they come from over that ridge? A mile away? He doesn't know. 
"Nothing you can do about that," Olague frowns. "But I'll remember it for 
tomorrow."

About 25 Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep listened to their bellies rather than 
their brains Wednesday and were lured to a meal of hay and mashed apples, 
hand-delivered by state wildlife officers. 

For one of the sheep, it would be a fatal mistake. 

The sheep mowed down the goodies that were laid out in a flat spot tucked in 
a little canyon off the Fryingpan River about five miles from Basalt. Red 
cliffs soared hundreds of feet above the feeding grounds. The entire landscape was 
covered with a thick blanket of snow. 

The mix of rams, lambs and ewes that came to the Colorado Division of Wildlife
?s party were oblivious to the net hovering over their heads. 

One second it was the picture of tranquility. The next, all hell broke loose. 

When a game warden tripped the switch that dropped the net, most of the sheep 
stayed upright and desperately tried to sprint away from the horde of humans 
that emerged from behind vehicles and barriers. 

Most of the sheep ended up in a massive tangle of hoofs, legs, horns and 
muzzles. The heads and necks of some struggling animals were twisted at awkward 
angles. The scene looked like a mosh pit at a punk-rock concert, or a peculiar 
game of Twister. </docText>

Noble, an Akita, was adopted on a Monday and returned to Fort Worth's animal 
shelter on a Wednesday. The adopter said he couldn't afford a big dog.

Art Tawater sees it almost every Christmas.
A hurried parent or grandparent, having put off holiday shopping till the 
last minute, drops by the Arlington animal shelter and picks up a cute puppy or 
kitten. The gift is a big hit with the kids on Christmas morning.
But a few days later, the dog has chewed the carpet, the kitten has clawed 
the furniture, and the pet's sleeping quarters stink.
Tawater, Arlington's animal services supervisor, says that's when some 
recently adopted pets are returned to the crowded shelter.
"Unfortunately, the animals are adopted on a whim, just like people go out 
and buy things on a whim every holiday season," he said. "And it's not good for 
the animal."
So far, few holiday gift animals have been returned to the Arlington shelter 
or Fort Worth's animal shelter. But it's bound to happen, as it does almost 
every year, officials said.</docText>

Sasha, 17, a female African lion, will be moved to the zoo hospital holding 
area while the feline house is rebuilt



Ace, age 11, a male cheetah, spends the time in the lion house before moving 
to temporary quarters.



The doors to the lion house will close Monday and aren't scheduled to reopen 
until July 2005.
While most of the 18 big cats that live in the building will be relocated 
temporarily, Colleen, Rocky, a snow leopard named Tankh and four caracals will be 
leaving the zoo for good, said Bess Frank, the zoo's curator for large 
mammals, on Saturday.
After these moves, the Milwaukee County Zoo will have no caracals or cougars. 
However, once the renovations are complete, the zoo plans to replace a lion 
and a jaguar that died last year with at least two new lions and two new 
jaguars.</docText>

The mad cow scare may have prompted some consumers to give up T-bone steak.

But there's no escaping the humble cow.

Gel capsules often are made from bovine gelatin. Bars of soap probably
come from processed cow tallow, which is solid fat. Asphalt roads may
contain bovine fatty acids. Cars and trucks may ply those roads on rubber
tires made with cow oils.

Even wars can depend on cows. The explosive nitroglycerine is manufactured
from glycerine, which is extracted from cow fat.

Cattle byproducts, simply put, are one of the glues that hold together the
industrialized world.

The discovery of a Washington Holstein with mad cow disease turned the
spotlight on the world of beef cattle, brains, spinal cords and meat. The
discovery also pointed to a largely unseen world in which cattle parts
turn into chicken feed, mayonnaise and sex hormones -- and the potential
that byproducts from an infected cow might transmit bovine spongiform
encephalopathy to humans. Federal authorities insist that is not a
significant risk. 
...
So the humble cow continues to yield fertilizer from dried blood, buttons
from hooves, neat's-foot oil from shin bones and toothpaste from fats.
Even the lowly gallstone is exported to China, where it is thought to have
mystical values, according to "The Meat We Eat" (Interstate Publishers,
1994, 1,193 pages).

"We're sometimes referred to as the original recyclers," said Tom Cook,
president of the National Renderers Association. "We take a lot of
material that would otherwise have no value and convert it into products
that do have value."

The Corsicana Animal Shelter has gone high-tech, giving homeless pets a 
better chance of finding a loving family.
Shelter supervisor Kristie Franks said the Petfinder Web site has done 
wonders for the adoption rate, especially during the holiday season. Corsicana's 
area of the site can be viewed at www.petfinder.com/shelters/TX533.html.
The results have been far-reaching, enabling one Keeshond to find a home in 
Pennsylvania, although most homeless pets from Navarro County are more likely 
to find new owners in cities like Houston, Dallas, Waco and Tyler.
"We have the software, so all we have to do is take a picture of the animal 
and post it on the Web page," Franks said, adding that city council approved 
the purchase of a digital camera for the shelter this year.
Some breeds, like the Keeshond, are sought after by rescue groups whose 
members are always on the lookout for adoptable animals. Other animal welfare 
groups provide foster homes for specific breeds until permanent homes can be found. 
For this reason, the Petfinder Web site is an especially valuable tool.</docText>

U.S. tries to quell Japan's fears about safety of beef  
U.S. agriculture officials flew to Japan yesterday to address concerns in 
the world's largest market for American beef about the discovery of the 
first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Japan, which bought more 
than $1 billion of U.S. beef last year, joined more than two dozen nations 
that suspended imports after a cow in Washington state tested positive for 
the brain-wasting bovine disease last week. A delegation from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture led by David Hegwood, a trade adviser to U.S. 
Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, was scheduled to meet with Japanese 
officials in Tokyo today. 

FDA blasted over past enforcement of feed ban  
Long before mad cow disease appeared in Washington, the federal government 
slammed the Food and Drug Administration for failing to adequately enforce 
feed regulations, a key piece of the nation's firewall against the disease. 
On Wednesday, the FDA tried to reassure the public by saying it has 
"vigorously enforced" a 1997 law that bans the use of meat and bone meal 
from dead ruminants (cows, sheep and goats) in feed for live ruminants. The 
agency said more than 99 percent of feed operators are now complying with 
the law. 

Advanced Meat Recovery machine under scrutiny  
A slaughterhouse machine that blasts the last bits of flesh off cattle 
carcasses already relieved of their more recognizable cuts of beef is coming 
under increased scrutiny as the discovery of mad cow disease in Washington 
raises questions about the safety of the nation's food supply. The 
machinery, known as Advanced Meat Recovery, sometimes also strips off spinal 
cord tissue, which can slip into the food supply unknown to the consumer.

Nothing, not an impending gala nor the chill of winter, can tempt Betty
Jean Bavar to dig out her once-beloved mink coat. "I don't know if it's a
reaction to popular sentiment toward the killing of animals or just that
my lifestyle is much more casual today," said Ms. Bavar, 61, who lives in
Baltimore. "I only know that I have stopped wearing fur."

Her daughter, Adrienne Bavar, however, tells a different story. "I don't
have a problem wearing fur," she said. "I'm not like, `Oh, my God, I have
on a dead animal.' " Ms. Bavar, 29, a public relations consultant in New
York, owns a fur-lined army jacket and wore a white mink stole on her
wedding day last year. Her friends agree that fur is fine, she said, so
long as it is not showy or dated, conjuring an image of Joan Collins in
her "Dynasty" days.
...
There are indications that the fear of ostentation and concerns over the
slaughter of fur-bearing animals that troubled the baby boomers do not
afflict many younger women. On the contrary, style-conscious women in
their late 20's and 30's seem to wear fur unabashedly, heeding fashion
more than conscience.
...
Other students of consumer attitudes suggest that flaunting pelts can be a
badge of rebellion. "Wearing fur is a quick way for you to feel superior
to your mother," said James Twitchell, the author of "Living It Up: Our
Love Affair With Luxury."
...
But Ingrid Newkirk, the president of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, disagreed that the animal-rights movement has lost a generation.
"There are plenty of young women who are revolted by the idea of fur," she
said. She suggested a visit to her organization's Web site to read the
testimonials of young women expressing a revulsion for fur.

Ms. Newkirk conceded that by offering new, relatively inexpensive styles,
the fur industry has successfully tempted some younger women. Indeed,
today there is a widening selection of furs with casual styling or fur
used as an accent on bomber jackets, vests, hoodies and the like. Many
furriers also offer skins that masquerade as something else. "A lot of the
fur we make looks like velvet or a yarn that's been knitted to resemble a
sweater," said Melissa Gellman, a spokeswoman for J. Mendel, a purveyor of
luxury furs and fur accessories. The company's slogan, "This Is Not Your
Grandmother's Fur," refers to innovations like sheared mink passing itself
off as velvet.

At prices below $5,000 for full-length rabbit coats, or several hundred
dollars for coats with fur collars, sweaters trimmed with fur and fur
scarves and hats , many women have found that fur is an affordable
indulgence, compared with a traditional sable coat, which can run into the
tens of thousands. "You can get a rabbit coat for $80," Ms. Newkirk of
PETA lamented, "basically the price of a few packs of cigarettes."

Of equal concern to animal-rights activists, she said, is the adoption of
fur as a status symbol. "Our major struggle at the moment is to get out
the message to people in the hip-hop community," Ms. Newkirk said, "people
for whom fur is a prized acquisition in much the way the Cadillac was two
generations back."</docText>

        <docText>Beluga caviar, pearly black and $1,500 a pound, goes 
well with Champagne. But next year, connoisseurs may have to do with farmed 
American caviar or lesser Caspian species if the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service decides to ban imports.
At issue is the number of beluga sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Some 
researchers say the sturgeon, a 200-million-year-old species, is in serious trouble. But 
in September, the Geneva-based Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, known as Cites, announced that numbers of 
beluga sturgeon rose to 11.6 million from 9.3 million from 2001 to 2002, 25 
percent. The figures were supplied to Cites by Russia's Caspian Fisheries 
Research Institute in Astrakhan, once the country's caviar capital.</docText>

An endangered Mexican gray wolf from Binder Park Zoo has been on the loose 
since Saturday morning, officials from the Battle Creek zoo said Monday. 
The wolf, along with two others, escaped from their enclosure through a small 
hole they stretched in their exhibit fence early Saturday morning. While two 
wolves were quickly recaptured, one climbed the zoo's 9-foot perimeter fence 
and remains at large. 
Greg Geise, Binder Park Zoo's president and chief executive officer, said the 
missing 19-month-old male wolf was born at the zoo and likely is trying to 
find its way home. The wolf is light gray in color with light brown on the 
bridge of its nose, has fluffy fur on both his face and body, and weighs about 60 
pounds. 
"We are very distressed by this event and are working hard to get the animal 
back," Geise said. "I understand the concerns and anxiety felt by local 
residents and want to assure them that this animal should not be considered a threat 
to them or their families."

  FWS ISSUES ADVISORY ON CATFISH IMPORTS INTO FLORIDA 
  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is warning ornamental 
  fish merchants not to handle any shipments of tropical 
  catfish from South America that may have come into the 
  United States through  Miami, as the packaging bags may be 
  contaminated with a substance that can cause serious illness. 
  The source of the toxin is unknown, but it is not directly 
  related to the imported fish themselves. The symptoms of 
  this toxin are predominately neurological when the packaging 
  has been handled: tingling of the hands, dialated eyes, 
  breathing difficulty and possibly euphoria. These symptoms 
  develop fairly rapidly, within minutes after contact, 
  depending on the length of contact and amount of toxin 
  absorbed. However, in severe cases, convulsions and even 
  death may occur. 
  
  The FWS has recently learned from the Florida Department 
  of Health that three Florida fish retailers have had employees 
  become ill from handling the catfish containers. In two 
  situations, the retailers could identify specific shipments 
  of cause, but the third patient reported several likely 
  sources. Further investigations by the Centers for Disease 
  Control and Prevention (CDC) may have uncovered additional
  reports of similar illnesses in New York and California. 
  
  "It is imperative that retailers not handle shipments of 
  ornamental catfish coming in from Miami," said Dr. Leslie 
  M. Cannelli, FWS Special Agent "until we have pinned down 
  the exact shipments and causes of the illnesses. But in 
  the meantime anyone who may have handled ornamental catfish 
  shipments should be alert to these possible neurological 
  symptoms and seek medical help if it is needed. They are 
  requested to immediately contact their local police department 
  for assistance." 
  
  The FWS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
  the states of Florida, New York, and California continue 
  to investigate this situation. While not explicitly identified 
  as responsible for the affected shipments, a list of ten 
  tropical fish import/export businesses of interest, with recent 
  catish shipments from South America, has been circulated:  
  Alberto Salazar Import Export, Aquatic Treasures, Ed Parker 
  Tropical Fish, Global Ways, Imperial Tropical Fish Farm, LB 
  Brandow Tropical Fish, Oceans Reefs and Aquariums, Odd Ball 
  Aquatics, Sanchez Brothers Tropical Fish, and Tidwell Fish Farm.

Alisa Harrison has worked tirelessly the last couple of weeks to spread
the message that bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, is
not a risk to American consumers.

As spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Harrison has helped
guide news coverage of the mad cow crisis, issuing statements, managing
press conferences and reassuring the world that American beef is safe.

For her, it's a familiar message. Before joining the department, Harrison
was director of public relations for the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association, the beef industry's largest trade group, where she battled
government food safety efforts, criticized Oprah Winfrey for raising
health questions about American hamburgers, and sent out press releases
with titles like "Mad Cow Disease Not a Problem in the U.S."
...
The Agriculture Department has a dual, often contradictory mandate: to
promote the sale of meat on behalf of American producers and to guarantee
that American meat is safe on behalf of consumers. For too long the
emphasis has been on commerce, at the expense of safety.
...
Yes, the threat to human health posed by mad cow remains uncertain. But
testing American cattle for dangerous pathogens will increase the cost of
beef by just pennies per pound. Failing to do so could impose a far higher
price, both in dollars and in human suffering.

Thirteen mixed-breed pit bulls, including six young puppies, are

81-year-old Citra resident Alice Broom.

        <docText>There are two things you don't want to see being made,"
German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck reputedly said. "Sausage and
legislation." The mad-cow episode in the United States illustrates that
quip as no other story in recent memory.

Americans today are learning far more than they ever wanted to know about
the process of turning cows into thousands of products that even a
hard-core vegan would have trouble avoiding - cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,
fire-extinguisher foam, lubricants, the glue that holds plywood together.
Not to mention the steaks, roasts, hamburger, and other meat items that
human carnivores regularly devour.
...
"Excluding cattle brains, eyes, spinal cord, and guts from the human food
supply is certainly a step in the right direction," says Michael Greger, a
medical doctor who studies BSE for animal rights and consumer groups.
"Unfortunately," he adds, "the US still feeds those potentially risky
tissues to pigs, pets, and poultry."

At the same time - more bad news for those who'd rather not know the
origins of their sausage - the litter from chicken coops (grain, feathers,
and manure) still can be swept up and fed to cattle under the new
regulations. "The major concern in feeding rendered cattle remains to
other animals," says Dr. Greger, "is that the cattle remains may directly,
or indirectly, find their way back into cattle feed, which could
potentially spark a British-style outbreak of mad-cow disease."</docText>

Even sedated, the dog had an incredibly fast reaction time - we learned later 
that she is a Border Collie. She also was developing a sense of increasing 
suspicion. It took six attempts over two days, culminating in the most horrible 
screaming fight I hope never to witness again. By the time the dog was pinned 
to the ground, I had enlisted the help of my partner Julie, Denise and her 
husband Ben, and some guy in a white car who stopped to offer help. Ben succeeded 
in getting a leash on her, but her reaction was so violent and out of 
control, we feared she was too wild to be rehabilitated. Through tears, I called the 
SPCA and waited to have her destroyed.

Above her piercing screams, I heard my cell phone ring. Diane Roadcap, a pet 
psychic and telecommunicator from Virginia whom I had talked with before about 
the dog, had chosen that particular moment to call to see how things were 
going. The dog was utterly hysterical with fear, thrashing at the end of a long 
line on a choke collar, wild-eyed and emitting strangled, screaming snarls. 

Diane was in Lewes that day, and she arrived a few minutes after the SPCA 
agents, who had transferred the dog to their control sticks in place of our choke 
chain. The dog calmed considerably.

Diane?s discussion with the dog was short, first reaffirming the dog?s 
desire to live. Some don?t want to, and have asked to die. Diane explained to the 
dog that we had to take her somewhere else, that it wasn?t safe for her there 
anymore.

Diane told the dog we were sorry we had scared her so badly; the dog told 
Diane she was sorry she tried to bite us. We promised that we wouldn?t hurt her; 
she promised she wouldn?t hurt us, and within a half-hour, the SPCA 
transported her to our house.</docText>

        <docText>The Sierra Club will sue a Solano County dairy for spilling a 
reported 1.3 million gallons of liquid animal waste into local waterways, it 
announced Tuesday.

Heritage Dairy is located about seven miles east of Dixon. The spill took 
place Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, 2003, county and state officials have said.
"We want folks in Solano County and Northern California to become sensitive 
to the impacts of these megadairies," said Vicki Lee of the Sierra Club.

The Sierra Club plans to file a federal lawsuit as early as March 1 under the 
Clean Water Act. It must give 60 days notice to the dairy owner and 
regulators, said Brent Newell, the attorney representing the club.

At issue is whether a spill occurred, Newell said. The club under the Clean 
Water Act doesn't have to prove the dairy acted recklessly, he said.

"The Heritage Dairy has an absolute duty to not discharge any pollution 
whatsoever," Newell said.


The club will seek a civil penalty of up to $27,500 per day for a spill it 
contends could have lasted two days. Newell said money would go into the federal 
treasury.</docText>

Regarding the story about the cat being dragged by the cable workers: This 
was an egregious act that, whether deliberate or not, should never have 
occurred. My main concern is that the true perpetrators of this vile criminal offense 
be punished.

I am also writing to state that I personally know the owner of the cable 
company on a business and community level. I have seen this man every week for a 
number of years at my place of work and can say nothing but nice things about 
him. He is a loving father of a large family, a professional and a good person 
all around.

I think it is wrong that this man's business and the livelihood of him and 
the other employees in his company should be put in jeopardy by the acts of a 
few, be they the workers or some other sick practical joker. The news and radio 
coverage I have seen just do not seem to answer all the questions posed in a 
case like this.

People have been calling his business and saying vile, cruel things about 
him, his company and his employees. This is almost as evil as what was done to 
the poor, innocent cat. 

If we as a community can have compassion for an animal, let us also try to 
remember that the acts of a few are isolated, but are not a true reflection of 
the whole.</docText>

two cable-television installers accused of tying a cat to the bumper of an 
Ocean Cable Co. truck and dragging it through the streets will face felony charges.
An arraignment scheduled yesterday in Atlantic City Municipal Court for one 
of the suspects, Joseph M. Newton, 25, of Galloway Township, was postponed 
pending the prosecutor's review. Newton is charged with animal cruelty.
An Atlantic City police sergeant allegedly noticed a cable-company truck 
dragging the animal Dec. 22 as another cable truck followed along Grammercy Avenue 
near Route 30.
Newton, who was driving the second vehicle, has pleaded not guilty, said his 
attorney, Jerry H. Steiner of Pleasantville.
The driver of the vehicle that allegedly dragged the cat, Robert Hewitt Jr., 
28, of Egg Harbor Township, waived arraignment and asked for a trial date to 
be set, according to a court official. Hewitt is charged with animal cruelty 
and inhumane treatment of an animal.
The municipal charges would amount to nothing more than disorderly person 
violations, which usually carry the penalty of a moderate fine.
But if the Prosecutor's Office decides there is sufficient evidence for 
felony animal cruelty charges in Superior Court, the men could face up to 18 months 
in prison and fines of $10,000.

Meanwhile, extreme cold weather puts extra stress on pets, but it can be 
managed for their health and comfort, said local veterinarian Linda Perry.

"You just need to pay attention to food, water and shelter," she said. "More 
food, warmer water and extra shelter."

Animals, including larger ones like horses and cattle, need an increased 
amount of energy, which means more food "to keep their furnaces running hot," 
Perry said.

A tank heater helps by keeping stock water warmer, so animals can drink more, 
stay warmer and avoid dehydration. Larger animals will also gain from a 
windbreak from the chill and blowing snow, she said.

"Preferably, dogs would be kept inside in this weather, at least in a garage 
or some sheltered area where they're completely enclosed," Perry said. "The 
dog houses just don't really keep them that warm when the temperature's this 
cold. And if they are outside, they can benefit from extra food also to generate 
internal heat."

Dogs that lack a winter coat or build for this kind of weather should not be 
outside, she said. Dogs seem to love it, but riding in the backs of pickup 
trucks when it's this cold can expose them to brutal wind chills, Perry said.

Cats, too, should be afforded protection from the elements, warm water 
sources and access to food to meet their intake requirements, she said. Older dogs, 
especially, with arthritis may benefit from heating blankets or beds. Pet 
owners may want to speak with their veterinarian about using anti-inflammatory 
treatments, she said.

Cold stresses the body and can lower immunities, Perry said.</docText>

        <docText>When the first case of mad cow disease surfaced
in the United States three weeks ago, the biggest problem wasn't finding
facts on the cattle brain destroying disease, but sorting through a jumble
of Web sites overflowing with information.

Consumers, trade groups and even local governments flocked to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Web site on bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) (http://www.fas.usda.gov/dlp/BSE/bse.html), calling it by far the
best resource on the Web.

"The USDA Web site is the best place for information," said Kiran
Kernellu, communications manager for the National Meat Association.
...
While there is no shortage of Web sites offering information about Mad Cow
disease, other sites by consumer rights advocates, animal rights activists
and vegetarians have also sprung up to promote their own causes.

The Organic Consumers Association Web site
(http://www.organicconsumers.org/madcow.htm) provides articles and
commentary on Mad Cow disease, along with a petition form for stricter
standards for beef entering the food supply.

People for the Ethical Treat of animals (PETA) also has a Web site
(http://www.peta.org/feat/madcowus/) called "It's Mad to Eat Meat"
offering links ot vegetarian resources as well.

In retaliation, the Web site of The Center For Consumer Freedom
(http://www.madcowscare.com) argues that consumer fears are being fueled
by "scaremongers" who are trying to capitalize on the outbreak.</docText>

        <docText>
Terrorists are targeting our pigs and potatoes. So argues the U.S. 
government, which has been putting our money where its fears are. The Bush 
administration has spent billions of dollars to prevent foreign agents from 
introducing diseases into livestock and crops. From Holsteins to hamburgers, 
though, our food supply doesn't seem any the safer for it.

Mad cow disease is today's headlines. One infected cow in Washington state 
has revealed the weaknesses of our food-supply system and the unwillingness 
of industry and government to respond to a genuine public health threat. 
Agro-terrorism experts, by contrast, are worried about tomorrow's headlines.

"We don't want to get so self-important that we think the only way to do 
damage to our country is by attacking human beings," Arthur Kaplan, a 
University of Pennslyvania bioethicist, told Minnesota Public Radio last 
year. "You could certainly bring this country to its knees by attacking its 
food supply."

"We're not going to run out of food because of a terrorist attack," said 
agro-terrorism researcher Anne Kohnen. "But the loss of markets overseas 
could be devastating." Agriculture is 13 percent of the United States gross 
domestic product and agricultural exports total $140 billion annually: a fat 
bull's-eye for terrorists.

American livestock, concentrated in certain areas (such as pigs in the 
Midwest) is particularly vulnerable. An outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease, 
such as the one that devastated the British cattle industry, could cost the 
U.S. industry $24 billion. And this figure, according to Harley Moon, 
University of Iowa emeritus professor of veterinary pathology, 
underestimates the full damage because it doesn't include indirect costs 
like lost tourism revenues.

This all sounds alarming. But it's largely hypothetical. The only case of 
agro-terrorism in the United States was the result of domestic actors: a 
religious cult that infected several Oregon salad bars with salmonella in 
1984. Nor have been there been many cases of agro-terrorism overseas.</docText>

        <docText>Staggering off the challenging ski
slopes of Heavenly Mountain in Lake Tahoe, Nev., the depleted body goes in
search of replenishment. Looking around the watering holes on offer at
this casino-crazed resort, beef seems to be the sustenance of choice in
restaurants decked out to look like forests, MTV sets, or shopping mall
buffet stations. There is almost total silence, aside from the fire engine
wails of snow-exhausted children, as diners hunker down over ribs, massive
steaks, and burgers you need a jaw hinge to consume. Well, heck, beef is a
manly food, instant protein, a basic nourishment, pure and simple. And
despite the first U.S. case of mad cow disease, it's clear these legions
of diners must be confident of its purity.

After all, President Bush is still eating beef. On Jan. 2, though having
been on a successful hunt for quail at Falfurrias, Texas, he declared, "As
a matter of fact, I ate beef today, and will continue to eat beef." Scott
McClellan, a White House spokesman, announced that despite the mad cow
scare, the U.S. food supply was safe and public risk from the discovery of
the disease was low.

For this particular Brit, those positive proclamations rang too many
apprehensive bells. In May 1990, the British minister of Agriculture in
John Major's Conservative government appeared on television
enthusiastically encouraging his 4-year-old daughter Cordelia to bite
greedily into a hamburger. British beef, he claimed merrily, was
"completely safe."

Just five years later, in another May, the first recorded victim of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease died. Like most of the other 119 British
victims as of December 2002, Stephen Churchill was pitifully young -- 19.
In December 1995, the year of his death, Prime Minister John Major
declaimed, "There is no scientific evidence that BSE can be transmitted to
humans or that eating beef causes it in humans."

According to the Human BSE Foundation, around 1 million cattle are
estimated to have been infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
since the disease was first diagnosed in 1986.
...
Given the global nature of the food business, it seems unwise to assume
that one instance of BSE in Washington state is a lone occurrence. But
knowing what the British have gone through, with the wholesale slaughter
of cattle, the loss of farmers' livelihoods and, worse, the dreadful loss
of life through the human variant of the disease, let's hope that this is
the case.</docText>

        <docText>The county of Miami Dade, Florida can be measured as more than 2,000 square 
miles from South Beach to the Everglade swamps and is filled with millions of 
creatures from Chihuahuas to alligators, but there is only one team dedicated 
to animal emergencies and they are the men and women of MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE. 
For the MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE team at the Miami Dade Police Department Animal 
Services Unit, their city is literally an urban jungle. Join the team as they deal 
with nearly 2,500 calls a month: a loose alligator causes a nine-mile backup 
on the freeway, a python is found in a public restroom and a cult that 
sacrifices animals is discovered. These cases along with many forms of animal abuse 
are explored in MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE premiering on Monday, January 5 from 10-11 
PM (ET/PT). Four more premiere episodes will air from January 6-9 at 10 PM 
(ET/PT). 
MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE follows a team of police officers dedicated to the Animal 
Services Unit (ASU) as they police the 2.2 million people of the extremely 
diverse Dade County area. Based minutes from downtown Miami and on-call 24 hours 
a day, the ASU responds to a broad range of animal situations, from the most 
dangerous and serious cases, to more light-hearted ones. </docText>

        <docText>Type in Beef.com rather than Beef.org and Internet surfers
seeking the latest on mad cow disease might think they've entered
alternative cyberspace.

The pro-vegetarian People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals launched
its Beef.com Web site Wednesday, happily noting the similarity to the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association online address.

The Denver-based trade group's site at Beef.org promotes the wholesomeness
of American beef products and insists the mad cow case reported in
Washington state last month is a single, isolated incident.

But mistakenly type in Beef.com and up pops a picture of a
foaming-at-the-mouth cow and the warning, ''It's mad to eat meat.''
...
''The best way to keep your family safe from contaminated meat is to throw
any meat in your freezer into the trash can,'' Friedrich said.

PETA posted its anti-meat and mad cow messages on Beef.com after Michael
Fischer of Troy, Mich., allowed the group to use his domain name.
Friedrich said Fischer, who was out of the country, was seeking $2.5
million for the address, but offered it to PETA for free for a month
because he's sympathetic to the group's cause.
...
In the United States, it's legal to feed cows' blood to cows as well as
sheep and cow parts to pigs and chickens and chickens to one another,
Friedrich said.

''All of this is in violation of the World Health Organization's
recommendations and of the best science aimed at keeping mad animal
diseases out of the meat supply,'' Friedrich said. ''Anything with a brain
can develop a spongy brain.''

PETA illustrates its argument on the Web site with a picture of a
gun-toting chicken with the words, ''If the beef doesn't kill you, I will.''</docText>

WHEN A single cow with mad cow disease was discovered in Washington state
last month, the National Cattlemen?s Beef Association (NCBA) lost no time
at all. NCBA lobbyists were on the phone to members of Congress--at their
home numbers, because they had left Washington for the holidays.

The association paid for teams of experts in all 50 states to feed news
media reassuring words about the safety of U.S. beef. In short, a massive
campaign not to protect U.S. consumers, but U.S. beef industry profits.

The cattle barons of the NCBA insist that beef is safe, that the cow in
Washington is an isolated case, that Canada is to blame anyway and that
the system is working just as it should. But the truth is that the system
is working as it always has--to protect their profits above all else.

For years, the beef industry ignored all the warnings of scientists and
health organizations, instead spending millions to buy political influence
and to staff regulatory agencies with cattle industry loyalists. No less
than Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman is a former NCBA lobbyist.

Dr. Stanley Prusiner, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who first
identified mad cow disease, met with Veneman almost two months ago--a
meeting he had sought ever since Canada discovered an infected cow last
May. "I went to tell her that what happened in Canada was going to happen
in the United States," Dr. Prusiner told the New York Times. "I told her
it was just a matter of time."</docText>

Since the Dec. 23 announcement that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
was traced to a cow in Washington state that has entered the U.S. meat
supply, news sources have focused almost invariably on one question: How
will this affect meat sales?

An alarm has been sounded, but for whom and for what? The answer stinks
like rotten meat, but few seem to be catching a whiff.
...
I've not heard one interviewee take the opening "Is meat safe to eat?" by
answering, "Actually, even before this incident, meat was unsafe to eat,
for many reasons other than BSE. Not only because of the food-borne
illnesses that sicken 38.6 million Americans annually (and kill 2,700),
but even more so because of the 1.5 million deaths from heart disease,
cancer and stroke every year."

The role of animal fats and meat in these conditions has been
overwhelmingly established. As Neal Barnard, M.D., president of the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, has declared, "The beef
industry has contributed to more American deaths than all the wars of this
century, all natural disasters and all automobile accidents combined."
...
Unfortunately, the media are acting almost solely as a forum for debate
about the impact of BSE on profits instead of the effects of meat
production on human, animal and environmental health. This is not helping
one iota to raise consciousness from what may well be the United States'
most ghastly complacency.

If this crisis inspires no one to probe beyond the financial health of a
rapacious industry, we are afflicted with a sickness more malevolent than
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Listening to unabashed market analysis that dwarfs matters of human health
and animal suffering, as corporate interests and government officials
scramble to soothe a remarkably unruffled consumer, I think not of "mad
cows." (What a clever naming convention, as if the cows are to blame!)

I see a mad world, and I feel a lonely sense of grief for its lack of
humanity and common sense.</docText>

Brian Weinstein isn't much of a cook: His only specialty, he says, is ragu 
sauce mixed with lean hamburger -- a topping he last whipped up for a 
spaghetti dinner served to his family a few days before Christmas.

But now the 49-year-old Mercer Island lawyer says he has sworn off making 
his specialty dish -- at least in its traditional incarnation.

He learned from local QFC officials that the ground beef he used for that 
spaghetti dinner 18 days ago was meat since linked to the slaughtered 
Holstein with the nation's only known case of mad cow disease. At 
Weinstein's request, store officials traced his purchase of that meat 
through his QFC Advantage Card.


Weinstein says he isn't one to get hysterical. He knows chances are slim 
that he, his wife or their children will contract variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
-- a disease that eats away at the brain. It has been diagnosed in only 
about 150 humans worldwide, likely caused from eating tainted beef.

Still, Weinstein now wonders and worries -- not for himself, but for the 
health of his two daughters, 9 and 12, and of his 14-year-old son.

"It's bad luck, really," Weinstein said yesterday. "It's like getting hit by 
lightning: There's one cow in the U.S. with mad cow, and my family probably 
ate it."

Officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department have repeatedly said the risk 
from eating muscle cuts from an infected cow -- the likely cut of meat that 
Weinstein's family ate in hamburger -- is extremely low.

Infected cows are known to harbor prions -- deformed proteins believed to 
cause mad cow disease -- mainly in brain and central nervous system tissue. 
Government scientists believe the only way cows get the disease is from 
eating feed mixed with such infected tissues.</docText>

Five months before the discovery of ``mad cow'' disease in the United 
States, Congress narrowly voted to let sick and injured cattle stay in the 
nation's food supply. Among California representatives, the more money a 
lawmaker received from the dairy and livestock industry, the more likely he 
or she was to support the controversial practice of turning so-called 
``downer animals'' into hamburger, steak and other meat, a Mercury News 
analysis has found.

California House members who sided with the dairy and livestock industry to 
defeat the measure last summer collectively received more than five times as 
much money in campaign contributions from those industries as California 
lawmakers who voted with consumer groups to end the practice, campaign 
spending records show.

Among the lawmakers who voted to continue the slaughter of downer cows for 
human consumption were two congressional representatives with districts on 
the Bay Area's doorstep: Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Stockton, and Rep. Dennis 
Cardoza, D-Merced.

Following last month's mad-cow discovery, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
banned all downer cows from the food supply last week.

Scientists have said for years that cows unable to walk are at higher risk 
for mad-cow disease, E. coli contamination and other food-borne diseases. 
The Washington dairy cow found to have mad-cow was a downer animal, as was 
the Canadian cow found last summer with the disease. McDonald's, Wendy's and 
Burger King won't accept downer meat, and the USDA forbids it in school 
lunches.</docText>

Spanning nearly a century, the National Western Stock Show, Rodeo and Horse 
Show remains quite a draw among the Stetson crowd: last year, more than 640,000 
people moseyed through Denver's stockyards during the 16-day event. 
But for Colorado's newcomers, or, say, the more urbanly inclined, navigating 
the 100-acre stock show can be a little intimidating. 




In addition to huge crowds, there are some 15,000 animals ? everything from 
cattle, swine and bison to yaks and llamas ? as well as nearly 400 vendors and 
dozens of performances, ranging from Mexican rodeo extravaganzas to freestyle 
reining and bucking bulls. 
Confronted with such a cornucopia of Western life and tradition, it can be a 
little hard to know where to begin. The fiddle contest? Perhaps the goat show? 
Maybe the dog agility games? How about that service by the Fellowship of 
Christian Cowboys? </docText>

Good morning. Ah, there's good news in the town that most people have to 
spell with a cheat-sheet: Waxahch, uh, Wasahach, uh, Waxahachie! 
In April, a bunch of do-gooder/animal nuts (high praise in my world) formed 
the Ellis County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
The organization is not affiliated with any other SPCA but does adhere to the 
goal of protecting animals. 
Now the nonprofit EC SPCA is caught up in a building campaign called "Waise a 
Woof!" says executive director Diane Dynis. The proposed $155,000 facility 
will have 55 inside dog kennels, six kennels with outside runs, a cat "condo" 
and other critter features. (Make donations to EC SPCA Building Fund, 800 N. 
Highway 77, PMB 138, Suite 160, Waxahachie, TX 75165. Call the EC SPCA at 
972-935-0756.) The EC SCPCA also needs "in-kind" donations ? building materials, 
skills and office and critter equipment. 
On Monday, the EC SPCA, paid $2,000 for a 2.3-acre "spread" formerly owned by 
the county at 2570 FM 878 on the east side of Waxahachie. (We'll keep you 
posted about the groundbreaking ? check Larry Powell's Pet Blog at 
www.dallasnews.com.) 
Now, as is tradition for animal people, turn to each other and chant our 
mantra, "If I win the lottery, there won't be a homeless dog or cat in Texas." </docText>

Meet Brody. He is attractive, friendly, sure to make a good companion -- but 
if no one adopts him within three days, he will be killed. 
According to the Utah County Animal Shelter, pet owners surrendered 2,495 
animals to the shelter last year. Of those pets, 79 percent were euthanized. 
"The number one thing prospective pet owners can do to help prevent homeless 
pets is adopt what they can take care of," said Utah County Animal Shelter 
attendant Jackie Barlow. "Adopting a pet is a lifetime commitment." 
Barlow said the animals that go to homes where owners do not realize the 
importance of their responsibilities often end up in one of several dire 
circumstances: wandering the streets, being abused or being taken back at the shelter 
to be euthanized. 
Barlow said she feels relieved when she puts a chronically ill and miserable 
animal to sleep, but when she has to euthanize a perfectly healthy, adoptable 
animal because of overcrowding, she becomes furious. 
"It really pisses me off," she said. "There are people who I tell, 'You know, 
if you leave this animal here, it will most likely be euthanized,' and they 
say, 'I don't care, let him go.' Those are the ones that piss me off. It's not 
the animal's fault, and it's not our fault. It's the irresponsible pet owner's 
fault."

        <docText>Howard the dolphin won't be strong enough to move to another 
aquarium anytime soon, despite months of trying to improve his health, West 
Edmonton Mall officials say.
Gary Hanson, the mall's general manager, announced last fall that the mall 
wanted to move Howard, but didn't think he would survive the trip because of his 
frail health.
Since then, the mall's only surviving dolphin has had a specific diet and 
exercise regimen to get his strength up, although the effects have been minimal. 
"He's not gaining enough weight, that's the real concern," Hanson said this 
week, adding that Howard's health has not been deteriorating.
A new home for Howard, should he be moved, hasn't been picked.
Brian Joseph, a marine veterinarian from Redding, Calif., has been seeing 
Howard once a month since 
August. He said Thursday that Howard is improving bit by bit, and eating more 
than he has in five to 10 years, but is still not close to being able to 
survive a move out of the mall. "I expected this to be a gradual process and it's 
turning out to be one." 
Joseph said Howard may never be healthy enough to move. "I look at his 
progress with guarded optimism."
Animal rights groups are growing impatient, believing that West Edmonton Mall 
is dragging its feet on moving Howard to another location.
Animal rights activists don't believe the dolphin's health will improve until 
he is moved.</docText>

A family watched in horror as fox hounds savaged their pet cat in their 
garden, it emerged today.

Jennifer Kervell and her daughters, seven and three, were in the kitchen 
preparing lunch when around 30 hounds from the West Somerset Vale Hunt came into 
the garden and tore apart their four-year-old cat called Holly.

Mrs Kervell, 30, from Combwich, near Bridgwater in Somerset, said her 
daughters screamed as they watched Holly being ?savaged?.

She said: ?One minute we were admiring the beautiful hounds then we suddenly 
realised they were sniffing around our garden for something.

?The hounds went out of view for a moment, then I realised they had hold of 
something. I could see it was Holly. I told the girls to go into the dining 
room but they wouldn?t listen. They saw everything and were screaming and 
screaming.?

Mrs Kervell, who describes herself as an animal lover and has two dogs of her 
own, said the hounds were still ?sniffing around? when she went outside to 
retrieve the remains of her pet.

?I went outside with a towel to get the body, which had been savaged, and the 
dogs were still there. The hunt master had obviously lost control of them. I 
had to gently push them away,? she said.

The incident, which happened on Christmas Eve, ?ruined? the family?s 
Christmas, Mrs Kervell said.

She added that she had always thought fox hunting was ?barbaric?, but had 
never thought it would affect her or her family.

?I live in the countryside and accept that hunting goes on but I would rather 
not think about it,? she said.

?I never thought they would come into my garden and affect my family. We are 
all devastated.?</docText>

        <docText>Just like humans, all animals need love and attention and good care 
to grow up healthy and well adjusted. That was the message of this week's 
guest Treible lecturer, Dr. Kimberly Kal-Downs.
Speaking to an intimate group of animal lovers, Kal-Downs, who is a 
veterinarian at Liberty Research in Waverly, gave suggestions and hints on how to keep 
family pets healthy and happy.
Most of the questions raised at the lecture focused on domesticated animals 
and pets. Kal-Downs emphasized the need for good shelter, regular veterinary 
check-ups, and above all, maintaining a consistently good dietary regime. Taking 
care of an animal is mostly common sense, but constant vigilance and 
attention to the animal is essential.
"Many of the health problems faced by our animals are induced by a bad diet," 
explained Kal-Downs, cautioning people to refrain from giving human food to 
animals. "You must watch for signs of health."
Indications of bad health come in many forms. Some of the ways to tell are in 
the animal's behavior, posture, the sheen of their coat and their interest 
level in normal daily activities. If your dog or cat appears to be healthy and 
shows an interest in eating and playing, chances are "that's a pretty good 
sign" of normal animal health.
If the animal is feeling under the weather, the change in their behavior is 
noticeable. Instead of being active, the animals will usually be drawn into 
themselves and refrain from normal behavior. In some cases, this is the direct 
result of diet. Kal-Downs pointed out that today, there are many different 
dietary supplements for animals. That includes animal feeds that are designed for 
specific weight and age groups. Again, as with humans, animals can sometimes be 
placed on a diet.</docText>

The DNA proves that the Washington State Holstein found to have bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in December definitely came
from a Canadian herd. You can almost hear the relieved sighs of the
American cattle industry, joined by the sighs of grain farmers and
exporters and meatpackers and the U.S.D.A. itself. In the world of
bureaucratic borders, this fact of origin makes a vital difference. It
will probably allow the United States to retain its status as a non-B.S.E.
nation, and that in turn will allow us to pry open the borders that
slammed shut, stranding shiploads of frozen meat and causing cattle prices
to drop sharply, almost as soon as that one case was discovered.

But in the world of global meat, the DNA doesn't make a bit of difference.
Moving cattle, meat and meat byproducts across borders is one of the
things our agricultural system does extremely well. That becomes obvious
only when the system stops, and it stops only when a disease looms,
whether it's a slow plague like mad cow disease, which takes several years
to incubate, or a fast plague like hoof and mouth disease, which ravaged
British farming just as it was beginning to recover from the effects of
mad cow disease.

Industrial agriculture is indeed industrial. It is designed to move parts
along a conveyor belt, no matter where the parts come from. And if one of
the parts proves to be fatally defective ? a dairy cow with the staggers,
for instance ? then shutting down the conveyor nearly always comes far too
late.</docText>

Jolanta ?Jola? Hernik of Poznan, Poland chose to volunteer at Mission: Wolf, 
a sanctuary for captive wolves and wolf-dog crosses located in the south east 
corner of Custer County, because she wanted to work with people who are 
driven by their ideals, not money. Being close to nature and working with animals 
were also part of her motivation to take on a six-month internship at Mission: 
Wolf. She has found these things and more. The 26 year old Hernik arrived at 
the remote 449 acre refuge on Dec. 9 and already she?s working hard feeding and 
caring for 41 wolves along side Mission: Wolf Director Kent Weber and 
long-term residents Kathy Bennett and Abby Nelson. It is arduous work. They manually 
haul water and many pounds of meat up treacherous snow-covered paths; then 
toss chunks of meat weighing as much as 40 pounds over the tall fences of the 
wolf enclosures. Farmers who have a horse or cow that dies often donate the meat 
for the wolves and roadkill deer can also be used. All need to be picked up 
and transported to the facility, butchered and carefully portioned out so each 
wolf receives the appropriate amount of nutrition. Hernik has helped butcher a 
horse using an axe; something, she says, a city girl like herself has never 
dealt with. She says it was hard for her because she loves horses. Making a fire 
to stay warm, getting used to living without running water and sharing her 
space with mice are also new to her. Maintenance and upgrades at the solar and 
wind powered facility require lots of labor, so repairing fences, helping with 
the construction of a new kitchen and plenty of office work have been part of 
Hernik?s experience as well.</docText>

But the light also makes red zebra GloFish -- A fluorescent glow gives the 
3-inch fish its claim to fame.

like the ones swimming in a local pet store's aquarium -- vulnerable to 
predators. That vulnerability, along with concerns about possible unforeseen 
effects on the environment, has placed the fish at the center of a nationwide ethics 
debate.

The fish, which has been genetically altered so it can absorb and re-emit 
light, have prompted some states to examine the future of genetically altered 
animals.

"I don't want to use the term wake-up call, but it has focused some state 
agencies' (attention) on the fact that this is possible," said Bill Foreman, a 
fisheries resource technician at the Inland Fisheries Division of the state 
Department of Environmental Protection. "We will be re-examining this issue and 
discussing it both within the agency and other state agencies."

GloFish are tropical freshwater fish that would not survive in New England's 
climate, so there is not much concern about them being released and affecting 
the local ecosystem, Foreman said. But because GloFish were bred from fish 
into which a fluorescent gene had been inserted, they raise questions about 
whether pets should be genetically altered, he said.</docText>

Last year a ginger cat with one eye was found in a box which had a brick on 
top of it in Cambridge Drive, Ipswich. The cat was claimed by its owner after 
it was dumped by someone else.

Ms Kettle said: "Rudolph could have been put there by kids or neighbours who 
don't like cats. 

"As Rudolph is so easy going it would not have been difficult to put him in a 
box and carry him away.

"People don't stop and think ahead. Five minutes of fun it could have ended a 
cat's life."

Cats are sometimes abandoned over Christmas because owners feel their pet is 
in the way when family visit. Another reason is when owners favour a kitten 
over an adult cat.

People are urged to think long term by taking on the responsibility of a pet. 
They should look at whether they can afford to pay for food and vet bills, 
and whether they have time to devote to it.

Rudolph is pure black with no markings and is thought to be three to four 
years old.</docText>

Paul Watson is as close as you can get to a 21st-century pirate of the
high seas.

As the self-proclaimed "captain" and founder of Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society, he has rammed ships, sunk them and been jailed by foreign
nations, all in the name of saving the lives of marine animals. Watson is
now trying to take over the national Sierra Club to further his cause.

He makes no apologies. He claims that the 10 ships his group sank between
1979 and 1998 were illegally hunting for whales. 
...
"The best way to understand Sea Shepherd is to view it as a more radical
Greenpeace," said Rik Scarce, author of the book "Eco-Warriors:
Understanding the Radical Environmental Movement."
...
The Center for Consumer Freedom, a group that promotes food choices,
supported by such restaurants and food companies as Philip Morris, notes
that notorious animal-rights activists, such as the Animal Liberation
Front's Rodney Coronado, got their start with Sea Shepherd. Coronado was
convicted of setting fire to an animal research laboratory.

For his part, Watson, 53, sees himself as a savior of the seas, not an
eco-terrorist.

And he insists he doesn't support the use of violence, at least according
to his own definition of the word. To Watson, violence constitutes
deliberate harm to a living being, not harm to property. 
...
So some Sierra Club members plan to be there Sunday, when Watson speaks at
the "high-tea" fund-raiser at a private home in La Jolla. Actors Richard
Dean Anderson and Linda Blair are among the Sea Shepherd supporters
expected to attend, said Lambert, the organizer.

Carol Flaig of Junction City took the family cat to be declawed in early 
December. She was one of the first pet owners in the area to use the new 
technology that makes trips to the veterinarian less painful.

"The first couple of days she was sleeping it off like they usually do," 
Flaig said. "After that she was already getting back into trouble."
For about a month, a carbon dioxide laser has been used for most types of 
surgeries needed by dogs, cats and other small animals at Marshfield Veterinary 
Service, 916 N. Central Ave., said Tammy Hofstad, small animal veterinarian.

Although the technology has been available in larger referral veterinary 
clinics, Marshfield Veterinary Service's CO2 laser is the first of its kind for 
local pets, Hofstad said. 
Before the vet clinic acquired the laser equipment, people were calling and 
asking for it, she said.

The laser is powerful enough for large animal surgeries, although only dogs, 
cats, ferrets, hamsters and other small animals will fit in the Marshfield

For four years, Star lived at the end of a length of rope tied to a tree, his 
body covered in fleas, and his ears tattered from fly bites. 
Whether it rained, thundered, snowed or sleeted, Star never got far from the 
tree or a small, filthy doghouse. 

 


He'd watch other dogs go by and stare silently. The owners finally abandoned 
the dog when they moved out, and he was picked up and adopted out by the 
Memphis Animal Shelter. 
Now the husky mix lives in a two-acre pasture with three other dogs and two 
horses. 
"It's hard to believe I've had this baby for over a year," said Kim Jones, 
who renamed him Dexter. "He has got to be the sweetest most appreciative boy 
I've ever seen. You never see him without a toy in tow. He is such a happy boy 
now." 
Most chained dogs don't get to live happily ever after, something that 
bothered Tammy Grimes. 
For six years she lived next door to a chained black Labrador retriever mix. 
She complained to a local humane group in her small town of Tipton, Pa. The 
owner moved the dog to a worse location, at the bottom of a hill. 
"Whenever it rained or snowed, the dog just stood in mud or wet," said 
Grimes. "It was terrible." 
She asked the owner for the dog, they called Worthless, but he always 
refused. 
"I felt so helpless and hopeless so I decided to take a stand and I hoped 
others would, too," said Grimes. 
She founded Dogs Deserve Better in August 2002. The advocacy group is 
dedicated to getting dogs off chains and into homes. 
"Their abuse is much more subtle, no less insidious," said Grimes. "They may 
not be in immediate danger of death. But death of the soul is still death to 
me." 
She managed to get the black dog from its owner and let it live in her house 
for six months until he died of heart failure. </docText>

The university lecture hall in Boston is strangely crowded for a Saturday
morning in summer. Inside 100 lawyers, nutritionists, academics and
public-health officials are lapping up a talk by Marion Nestle, a
nutrition professor from New York University. Nestle seems to be enjoying
herself too. On to the projector screen pops a photo of an Oreo
cookie-counting book, designed to teach toddlers to count. "It counts down
from 10 to one," says Nestle. "You start with 10 cookies and eat them one
by one. At about 50 calories a piece, that's at least 500 calories!"
Laughter from the lawyers.
...
Today, Nestle is the keynote speaker at the first annual conference on
"Legal Approaches to the Obesity Epidemic". Here at Northeastern
University in Boston is gathered a group that wants nothing less than to
change the way the $900bn-a-year US food industry operates - and,
ultimately, the way that America eats.
...
Banzhaf teaches a course in public-interest law dubbed "sue the bastards"
by his students. (He has no objection; his car's number plate reads SUE
BAST.) His course requires students to come up with ideas for
public-interest cases. In 2001, a group of students had developed a
complaint against McDonald's over its claim that it cooked its French
fries in 100 per cent vegetable oil. A vegan student in Banzhaf's class
had discovered that McDonald's pre-cooked them in beef extract. An
attorney brought the case on behalf of a group of Hindus, barred by their
religion from eating beef, and won an apology and a $10m donation to
charity from McDonald's. Banzhaf calls it the first successful "fat"
lawsuit, and thinks it could be a model.

With its huge oil portraits of beatific steers, The Broiler Steakhouse in
downtown Sacramento is a shrine to beef. In the kitchen, Chef Lalo
Valenzuela proudly lofts a 35-ounce porterhouse -- a marbled wonder and
the restaurant's biggest cut -- and considers the impact of the recent mad
cow scare on the public palate.

"Last weekend," he said, "we sold a half-dozen of these. We had one party
of 27, and 26 of them ordered New York steaks. Overall, we thought we'd
see more effect from mad cow, but so far it hasn't materialized."

Valenzuela's comment mirrors the observations of restaurant owners and
food economists nationwide, who find the American public isn't panicking
over the discovery last month of a mad-cow-infected Holstein in Washington
state. People are wary, they say, but not hysterical.
...
Mark Livener, 35, was walking out of Johnny Rockets, a 1950s-style diner
in Downtown Plaza, after sharing a burger with his 7-year-old son, Jake.
He said that making the next showing of "Lord of the Rings" was on his
mind, not mad cows.

"I took a bigger risk driving over here than eating that hamburger,"
Livener said as he and Jake rushed to the theater. "Why should I give up
meat over one sick cow?"
...
"The way meat is raised in this country is a horror show," said Paul
Cultrera, Sacramento Natural Foods Co-Op general manager. "A lot of our
customers for years have told us they are vegetarian because they don't
want to support the industrial meat machine."

Marion the Barbarian has the best nickname among the 
15 gray wolves.

Marion is docile with her human handlers. She is outgoing and loves to chew 
shoelaces. But she is a terror to the wolves around her. She has bitten every 
wolf and driven some from the pack. She spends large amounts of time pacing in 
her pen. She is the queen.

Male wolves fight for fun, but female wolves, especially super alpha females 
like Marion, fight for life-and-death, volunteer Rebecca Bailia-Sisk said.

She offered that tidbit to a group of wolf-loving tourists during a 45-minute 
walking tour at Wolf Park, a combination zoo-research center with hand-raised 
wolves that are socialized to humans.

The park is now closed for the season (it reopens May 1), but during these 
off-season months, visitors can attend the center's very popular 90-minute wolf 
howls/lectures on Saturday nights. It is chilling to hear the howls, yelps and 
moans up close. (There is, by the way, less howling in the summer.)

The 75-acre facility seems strangely out of place surrounded by cornfields 
and soybeans near Lafayette in the flat farmlands of northwest Indiana, 130 
miles southeast of Chicago.

The center--it gets 20,000 visitors a year--is generally considered one of 
the best wolf centers in the country, along with the International Wolf Center 
in Ely, Minn.

During the season (May 1-Nov. 30), Wolf Park's walking tour of a quarter-mile 
takes you along a gravel path to view the wolves, along with four foxes, 21 
bison and one coyote. But the wolves--ambassador animals--are the big 
attraction.

The park specializes in wolf behavioral research, especially reproductive and 
interpack social behavior. Each wolf pack has its own rank and social 
structure.

The still-wild wolves demonstrate standard behaviors with the aid of human 
interpreters as part of Wolf Park lectures on wolf social structure, 
communication, behavior, handling methods and wolf research.

In addition, the center offers an array of multiday workshops with serious 
wolf study and wolf photography.

        <docText>In 20 years of specialising in wild cuisine, chef He Dazhong said 
he has prepared at least 300 different types of exotic animals for the dining 
table.
He gave a brief recipe for the most common way of preparing civet cat: After 
the animal is killed and gutted, it is dipped into boiling water. The meat is 
fried in 200 deg C oil before stir-frying it with a special fragrant ye wei 
sauce which tastes slightly salty. If done right, civet cat has a unique 
fragrance and a 'dry, crunchy, fresh and sweet' taste, he said.
Customers are charged by the weight of the meat they order. At the Huang Pu 
Jiang Hotel, where chef He works, the dish can go for about 400 yuan (S$82) for 
1kg of civet cat meat.
Other popular ways of preparing wild cuisine include stewing or boiling the 
exotic animals for soup. Guangdong residents, especially in the rural areas, 
also prepare wild cuisine in their own homes.
Construction supervisor Chen Ming said he had his first taste of ye wei when 
he was seven years old.
He said game in general tastes best when caught in the wild, preferably 
boiled for soup. He has tucked into rodents, owls, even a cobra, though not civet 
cats.
Experts and ordinary residents alike say ye wei is rarely eaten, except 
during the winter months, when the exotic animals are thought to give a person's 
health a much-needed boost.
Chef He disagrees. He said: 'I don't think ye wei has any health benefits at 
all. The taste is unusual, but the effect, if any, is only psychological.'
Then why has he been in the trade for two decades? He answered: 'Because 
there is a demand.' -- Chua Chin Hon 

Vendors spend their time playing pool, knitting or complaining to visiting 
journalists how bad business is.
'I don't even have enough money for the trip back to my parents' home in 
Hunan,' said a stall helper.
Officials have seized thousands of civet cats and other exotic animals from 
markets such as Xinyuan, restaurants and breeding farms since China confirmed 
its first Sars case in six months last Monday.p Across town, in the northern 
outskirts of Guangzhou, the rows of up-market wild game restaurants have 
removed all signboards hawking exotic animals, or ye wei, as it is known here.</docText>

Ranchers will suffer lower cattle prices ``for some
time to come'' due to the first U.S. case of mad cow disease despite
America's unwavering appetite for hamburgers, steaks, ribs and roasts, the
head of the largest U.S. farm group said on Sunday.

The U.S. response to mad cow disease was expected to dominate the annual
meeting of the 5.5-million-member American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF)
here. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman will speak to the convention by
satellite on Monday. 
...
Wildeman said the Canadian system, which is run by the cattle industry,
was invaluable in tracking down herdmates of infected cows. Canada
reported its first native case of mad cow on May 20 and was the birthplace
of the U.S. case.

``It's a good thing that dairy cow (in Washington state) was born in
Canada. We'd never have found her,'' an Oregon farmer told Wildeman.

A consortium of federal, state and industry officials were drafting a U.S.
animal ID plan that would take its first step this summer: the issuance of
identification numbers for farms, ranches and feedlots. Assignment of
animal ID numbers would begin in early 2005.

With cattle ID, Wildeman said, ``we saved the slaughter, we think, of
10,000 cattle'' by accurately tracing animals in the mad cow investigations.

By comparison, U.S. officials ordered the slaughter of a herd of 450 bull
calves because they could not be sure which one was the offspring of the
infected cow in Washington state. </docText>

Jim Rickert was struggling to meet the demand for his organic beef even
before mad cow disease became front-page news.

Now, as consumers hear more about the disease and how it is spread, the
rancher is flooded with orders.

"The calls started coming right after the news got out," said Rickert,
general manager of Prather Ranch, one of California's largest organic and
grass-fed beef producers. "People seem more interested in what cattle are
eating."

It's been two weeks since a cow in Washington state was diagnosed with the
disease, and Rickert said demand keeps growing. The Prather Ranch Web site
warns that it could take a month to fill orders.

Mad cow can go undiagnosed for years, and it kills cattle and people. It
spreads as cattle eat their diced peers in feed mixes and calves are fed
bovine blood. The protein-rich feed can pass the disease from a dead cow
to a live one, and on to consumers.
...
Chickens, which aren't susceptible to the disease, are fed protein meal
that includes cattle parts. The concern is that poultry litter --
including undigested protein meal, feathers and manure -- is fed to
conventionally raised cattle. Pet food, which can include bovine meat and
bone meal, also is fed to cattle.

Organic cattle are not allowed to consume either type of feed.

The two standards are sparking interest in organic beef, according to
Rickert, because his animals eat a vegetarian diet.
...
"I've been eating organic beef, so I'm not eating hormones or pesticides,"
said Carl Sacco, a 45-year-old Modestan and co-owner of Cornucopia Natural
Foods. "Now, with mad cow, I'm convinced it's the way to eat."</docText>

If you're as alarmed as I am about Washington's mad-cow case, then you
know precisely why the disease must be stamped out without an instant's
hesitation:

To shut the gobs of insufferable vegetarians here. Especially the ones who
wear leather.

One of mad cow's most horrifying symptoms is to make these people even
more self-righteous than usual. In a just ecosystem, they would begin to
stagger after eating veggie burgers with those fake grill marks. Silly Cow
Disease. (Incidentally, I plan to have my next New York strip cut into the
shape of a zucchini.)

Take note of my bovine field research: During the WTO riots, I found
myself interviewing one of the lead protesters in their headquarters. He
seemed ill at ease, so I tried an ice-breaker. "Pez?" I said, holding out
the dispenser.

He gawked at it. "Is it vegan?"

"No, but this is," I said, and launched the ninny across the room with a
swift foot to his sunken chest. 
...
Tasty irony here. Cows are vegetarians who generally mind their own
business, and never pick an argument over whether the guy they're dating
would store his meat in their refrigerator if they were married. They get
sick when evil ranchers turn them into carnivores ? and cannibals ? by
feeding them nasty remains of cattle and other livestock. It's all very
impolite.
...
Meanwhile, McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's promptly issued statements
to reassure consumers that their beef is safe from mad cow ? and the
Hamburglar has always walked that way. Fast food will only clog your
arteries, make you balloon into Ruben Studdard and then implode your
heart. But your brain is perfectly McSafe</docText>

Perched motionless on a rock across the street from the 
Paiute Tribal Headquarters in Cedar City, a Utah prairie dog late last month 
spied on officials arriving to discuss whether the threatened species is 
compatible with golfers. 
    The problem lies in the prairie dogs' penchant for panoramic views and 
need for ample water and food -- habitat provided by the well-groomed fairways 
and greens of the Cedar City-owned Ridgeway Golf Course, located adjacent to 
tribal land. 
    "The golf course is a 'Mazatlan' for prairie dogs," says Rick Holman, the 
city's adminis- trative-services director. "In spring and summer, they just 
lie down, stretched out on their bellies, eating the grass." 
    While still short of the colossal problem caused by the burrowing gopher 
menace portrayed in the 1980 movie "Caddyshack," a matrix of tunnels dug 
beneath the golf course by the burrowing prairie dogs is creating maintenance 
problems and safety concerns.

Curtis Cloutier runs what you might think of as a halfway house for dogs. 
It's not that the dogs who wind up in his temporary care are coming out of 
prison or anything like that, but being retired racing greyhounds fresh off the 
track, they're used to a regimented life with lots of rules and regulations. 

 


Dinner comes at a certain time, they get out of their kennels to exercise at 
a certain time, lights out comes at a certain time. And the distractions that 
fill a pet dog's day - cats, chew toys, mail carriers - well, there ARE no 
such distractions at the track. Track life is very no-nonsense. 
Yet these dogs may be no more than 3 to 5 years old. They still can have a 
long career as a pet ahead of them, but they've got to put their old life behind 
them first. </docText>

Beef cattle and 
dairy cattle represent two different types of animal, but their fates are 
identical. What most Americans do not realize is that nearly every dairy cow 
eventually becomes either hamburger or the cheaper variety of steak when her 
profitability drops. Holsteins are frequently culled for slaughter when they are 
between 5 and 6 years old. When you figure that a Holstein first gives milk when 
about 2 years old, that means a productive life on the dairy farm of about three 
years. In that brief life span, everything is done to maximize yield, 
including the regular use of antibiotics and the feeding of high-protein concentrates 
of the kind that used to contain meat and blood meal from other Holsteins, a 
practice that has since been banned.

After poultry and pigs, the dairy industry has become one of the most 
concentrated forms of agriculture in America. The old mental picture of a herd of 
Holsteins standing hock-deep in pasture bears no relation to the way milk is 
produced in much of America. Some herds, especially in the West and Southwest, 
number in the thousands, which means the animals spend their lives in barns on 
cement where they are milked automatically, in some cases on huge rotating 
platforms that look like something out of science fiction.

Meanwhile back at the corporate cattle ranch, rumors of mad cow disease
are circulating among the cattle. One group of four seem to be ruminating
upon serious matters. Let's listen while they chew the cud.

Daisy: Did you hear that poor Melvin went down and, instead of burying the
poor slob, those ranchers just shipped him off to the slaughterhouse?

Gabby: Yup, I heard talk of a few others in that condition that are on
their way to the meat market. But what happened to Melvin to make him so
sick that he couldn't even stand on his own anymore?
...
Daisy:  But why have some of us been getting sick with the BS?

Doc: That's BSE, Daisy. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. It's a
degenerative brain disease that can be transferred through the blood,
tissues, and organs. Humans get an equivalent of it, called Creutzfeldt
Jakob disease, from eating diseased meat. And there are other
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE's) in the whole food chain.
Some human doctors think there are even connections to diseases like
Alzheimer's.
...
Daisy:  Now wait, Doc. You're soundin like one of those turncoat
vegetarians. I mean what will become of us if humans won't hunger for our
meat.

Doc: Look, Daisy, it's estimated that as much as 1/4 of the land mass on
earth is devoted to cattle raising. And all of the shit and urine, pardon
my French, is contibuting to massive pollution. Why we're soiling our own
nests, so to speak. I think we've become a plague that humans invented out
of greed and protein obsession. So, we need to find some balance in all of
this.
...
For those who may want to ruminate on these matters, try reading Jeremy
Rifkin's Beyond Beef; Howard Lyman's Mad Cowboy; Sheldon Rampton and John
Stauber's Mad Cow USA; and Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation.

While preparing dinner one night last February, Supriya Kelkar didn?t
think twice before tearing open a package of Lipton SideKicks Broccoli and
White Cheddar Pasta mix.

Kelkar, a vegetarian, had read the package?s label in the supermarket
earlier. Among the ingredients listed on the package were pasta, salt,
cornstarch, cheddar and blue cheese, whey, broccoli, MSG, spices,
autolyzed yeast extract, maltodextrin, and natural flavors.

What came next shocked Kelkar.

?I had a taste of the pasta, and I immediately sensed something ?meaty,??
she told India-West.

So she called the 800 number of Lipton?s customer service to ask if the
product contained meat as one of its ?natural flavors.? She was told by a
representative that it was safe to assume that it did. Kelkar, 23, a
vegetarian since her teens, decided to write a letter to complain.
...
Tejas Mehta, a CPA living in Anaheim, Calif., was a regular customer at a
Marie Callender?s restaurant there. ?I used to go there regularly for
Lions Club meetings,? he recalled, ?and I used to eat the same Fettucini
Alfredo due to the lack of vegetarian choices.?

He asked a waitress to check that the dish was vegetarian, and she
?specifically confirmed? that it was, he said. Mehta, an adherent to the
strictly vegetarian Jain religion, had heard from an acquaintance that
some restaurants added chicken stock to their Alfredo sauce to keep it
moist, so he asked the waitress to doublecheck. His fears were confirmed
when she returned from the kitchen. ?It had been non-vegetarian all
along,? he told India-West.
...
A 2003 national Harris Interactive survey question sponsored by the
Vegetarian Resource Group concluded that about six percent of the United
States population never eats meat (which translates to about 5.7 million
people), while a Time magazine poll last year set the number at closer to
10 million. ?A look at the increased number of vegetarian products now
available is evidence that the interest in vegetarian foods has exploded
in the last few years,? states the VRG?s report, which is posted on their
Web site, www.vrg.org.
...
Efforts to legislate the identification of meat in products have not made
much progress; in 1999 Veggie Lawyers, a group of law students at George
Washington University, petitioned the FDA to change their regulations and
persuaded hundreds of citizens to write to the FDA in support; their
campaign fizzled out in mid-2001.

But one lawmaker has renewed efforts to identify meat on product labels in
an attempt to help not just vegetarians, but also consumers with allergies.

Nita M. Lowey, a Democratic Congresswoman from New York?s 18th district,
introduced H.R. 467, also known as the ?Food Ingredient Right to Know
Act,? in the House of Representatives Jan. 29, 2003.
...
A spokesman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the most
visible vegetarian advocacy group in the United States, said the group
deliberately does not issue a vegetarian label for foods. ?For PETA, it?s
not about dogma,? Bruce Friedrich, director of vegan outreach, told
India-West. ?We consider it of utmost importance to save the animals. To
focus on infinitesimal ingredients misses a few key points. We have
enormous respect for religious and dietary restrictions, but they tend to
place personal purity ahead of saving animals. That hurts animals.?

EarthSave, an organization founded in 1988 by one of America?s most famous
and influential vegetarians, bestselling author John Robbins (?Diet for a
New America,? ?Food Revolution?), is enthusiastic about a labeling
program. ?We?d absolutely encourage a label,? said EarthSave executive
director Caryn Hartglass. ?People have been talking about a label for a
long time. We certainly need one. But it needs significant interest from
the public.? She invites India-West readers to contact the organization to
show support for a labeling campaign (see sidebar). 
...
According to dietician Geeta Sikand, ?The industry is consumer driven and
in my opinion will respond to the consumers? needs. If consumers demand
for a label that states, ?contains no meat products? or ?contains no
animal products,? I believe the industry will respond. Vegetarians have a
right to know what is in the food they eat.?</docText>

Just the name "mad cow" disease is enough to inspire alarm, and its 
scientific appellation isn't any more comforting: bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy. Humans who eat infected meat may suffer from a form of the 
illness called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a brain-wasting affliction 
that, as David Plotz memorably put it several years ago, "murders by driving 
its young victims insane, then melting their brains." The illness is 
horrible, made even creepier by its long incubation (five years or more) and 
the lack of any cure. It was all but inevitable that the discovery just 
before Christmas of a single cow in my home state, Washington, that tested 
positive for BSE would send the nation into panic mode.

But as a few journalists have pointed out, the U.S. is hardly on the verge 
of an epidemic, and the odds are good that over the next 10 years hardly a 
soul will contract the cow-transmitted form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Even in 
Great Britain, where thousands of BSE-affected cattle entered the food 
supply eight years ago, only about 140 people have died from it. That's too 
many, of course, but it's a minuscule number compared to flu-related deaths 
(3,000 to 4,000 a year in England) or fatal auto accidents (about 3,500 
annually). Here in the United States, food-borne illnesses of all types 
cause 5,000 deaths a year&#x2014;a number not likely to change a whit due to mad 
cow.

In fact, mad cow disease in the United States may be the best thing to 
happen to the U.S. food industry and consumers since the invention of 
refrigeration. It's entirely possible that as a result of the current panic, 
in 10 years we'll not only look back and find next to no cases of mad cow in 
humans, but also look around at a better, healthier food supply. Perhaps 
we'll even have whittled down that appalling deaths-from-bad-food figure.

Reflections of a mad cowboy  
If you're as alarmed as I am about Washington's mad-cow case, then you know 
precisely why the disease must be stamped out without an instant's 
hesitation: To shut the gobs of insufferable vegetarians here. Especially 
the ones who wear leather. One of mad cow's most horrifying symptoms is to 
make these people even more self-righteous than usual. In a just ecosystem, 
they would begin to stagger after eating veggie burgers with those fake 
grill marks. Silly Cow Disease. (Incidentally, I plan to have my next New 
York strip cut into the shape of a zucchini.) Take note of my bovine field 
research: During the WTO riots, I found myself interviewing one of the lead 
protesters in their headquarters. He seemed ill at ease, so I tried an 
ice-breaker. "Pez?" I said, holding out the dispenser.

As the United States confronts fears of mad cow disease in
the beef supply, Patrick and Alison tend to their daughter, gently wiping
the drool from her mouth and talking to her in familiar soft tones.

It's hard to imagine Charlene as she was at age 23 and younger. Those
years were filled with a talkative exuberance, since stolen by variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or the human version of mad cow disease.
...
Patrick and Alison are originally from England, where they suspect
Charlene ate contaminated beef sometime before 1992. She is one of 129
cases reported in the United Kingdom from October 1996 to November 2002,
according to the World Health Organization.
...
During the weekend, the U.S. government announced that it would give DNA
tests to an infected Washington state cow to determine if it originated
from Canada. If so, the United States could seek a clearance stamp from
the WHO. That would classify the nation free of mad cow since the disease
was found in imported cattle and authorities acted to eradicate it.

Beef industry advocates champion the move as a way to save the millions of
dollars it has lost in the past few weeks because foreign nations have
banned U.S. beef.

Consumer advocates, and Charlene's parents, consider it an outrage.

"We should be testing every cow. If one person gets it here, that's one
too many," said Patrick, who asked that The Herald not print the family's
last name. 
...
"We just want people to be really careful. Consider what they are eating
and how safe it is," Patrick said. "We know there are few people who get
this disease, but the worst thing is to see even one more family go
through this."

USDA Secretary Ann Veneman, last week, listed a national animal
identification program as a major USDA policy priority for mad cow disease
prevention.

USDA has worked with federal and state governments, and with the
food-animal industry for the past 18 months toward the adoption of a
verifiable nationwide animal identification system, says Veneman. The
point is to help enhance the speed and accuracy of the United States?
response to disease outbreaks across many different animal species. "I
have asked USDA's Chief Information Officer to expedite the development of
the technology architecture to implement this (identification) system as a
top priority," she adds. 
...
Implementation of USAIP is scheduled to occur in three phases:

    *
      Phase I, involves premises identification, and is set to begin by
July. This phase would require establishing standardized premises
identification numbers for all U.S. production operations, markets,
assembly points, exhibitions and processing plants.
    *
      Phase II, would enable individual animal or group/lot identification
for interstate and intrastate commerce.
    *
      Phase III, involves retrofitting remaining processing plants and
markets and other industry segments with appropriate technology to enhance
traceability of animals throughout the livestock marketing system.

If the Bush Administration gives priority to the USAIP, bureaucratic
obstacles will be fewer, Slack predicts. "The other big question is money.
Who's going to pay for it? Secretary Veneman says this is needed to
protect public health. It's logical that tax dollars be spent to set up a
world class system," he contends.</docText>

        <docText>Loran Balvanz has figured out how to make a silk purse from a sow's 
rear.
Global Resource Recovery Organization, headquartered on State Road 70, has 
entered into an agreement with Iowa-based United Suppliers Inc. to build a 
$650,000 swine confinement facility in Hardin County, Iowa, that will be like no 
other. Swine waste will be turned into a value-added product that can be sold 
for a profit: high-quality organic fertilizer. The goal is to create a better 
environment for animals and neighbors.
The technology has applications for Florida dairy farmers, paper mills and 
municipalities dealing with sludge disposal issues, Balvanz said.
Balvanz's achievement is no laughing matter, but among Iowa's swine farmers, 
the jokes abound. They have to deal with the stench of swine manure, a smell 
that causes feuds between neighbors and permeates clothing and the skin.
"You wouldn't last two seconds in there," Balvanz said.
The smell of waste from dairy farms on hot summer days is familiar to 
residents living in East Manatee along Upper Manatee River Road. His new technology 
has the potential to cut down those problems.
Balvanz's Tempest Drying System will reduce the odor problems by more than 50 
percent and eliminate the need for lagoons and under-building storage of </docText>

Musher Bruce Milne isn't too worried about not being able to eat beef for
half of the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race as a result of fallout
over a Canadian ban on beef products.

After all, it's a well-known fact that Milne is a junk-food addict who
survives mostly on candy bars during the grueling 1,000-mile race from
Fairbanks to Whitehorse, Yukon.

Rather, it's his dogs that Milne is concerned about. Sled dogs burn up to
10,000 calories a day running the Quest and mushers like to have a variety
of choices for their canine athletes to replenish that energy. Beef ranks
near the top of most mushers'--and dogs'--lists of favorite foods.

"I think you could run the entire race on dry dog food if your goal is
just to finish," said Milne, who has completed the race three times. "If
your goal is to run your dogs to the top of their limits, then you've got
to have all the nutritional options at your disposal." 
...
Even if mushers end up being able to use beef for their dogs, mushers
won't be able to send any personal food into Canada that contains beef
products, said Rich, who advised mushers to avoid beef in their personal
food supplies.

That doesn't bother Milne, who subsists mostly on Almond Joy candy bars
during the race.

"I did expand my diet this year," he said. "I bought some Reese's Peanut
Butter Cups."

Neither is West, who is "almost" a vegetarian, concerned about not being
able to eat beef when she's mushing through Canada.

"I mostly eat Power Bars and Gatorade anyway," she said.

Ground beef is suspect, farmed salmon has PCBs. Veal fell from grace in 
the'70s, Atlantic swordfish is a no-no, tuna has mercury. 
We're told to avoid pork raised on factory farms, trawl-harvested shrimp, 
hormone-laced milk. 
Even the blandest of alternatives -- tofu -- comes from genetically modified 
soybeans. 
And let's not get started on bottled water. 
A conscientious eater can be forgiven for feeling that a simple trip to the 
supermarket is fraught with peril. Last month's disclosures about mad cow 
disease had barely faded from the front pages when scientists announced Thursday 
that farmed salmon should be eaten no more than six times a year. 
What's next? 
"When it comes to food, ignorance is not bliss," said Michael Straus, 
president of Straus Communications, a San Francisco-based consulting firm 
specializing in organic products and environmental issues. 
"The food system is complicated and not as straightforward. ... When you go 
to a fast-food restaurant and buy a burger, there's a lot going on, and very 
few people want to know until there's a problem." 
Federal food and agriculture agencies -- and many scientists -- insist the 
food on our plates is safe, be it an organic tomato, a genetically modified corn 
tortilla, a Tyson chicken breast or a Niman Ranch lamb chop. 
But then they note the fine print: Mercury levels in tuna are borderline 
enough that scientists suggest pregnant and nursing mothers limit consumption. </docText>

        <docText>A small black and white terrier mix spent five days caged up outdoors in 20

The full-grown dog with no name would have been put to sleep in a couple more 
days if Diana Blackwell of the St. Francois Society hadn't picked her out of 
the bunch of dogs there.
The animals there have just seven days at the Park Hills pound before they 
are put to sleep by a veterinarian. But some pounds in the area give animals 
even less time than that.
Blackwell rescued the dog from the pound Monday and gave her a temporary home 
with Tamara Madison of Park Hills.
Madison, like 12 others in St. Francois County, is a foster parent for 
animals who have been saved by Blackwell and will be taken up to PetsMart stores in 
St. Louis for adoption.
Blackwell, and a few volunteers like her, rescue stray animals from pounds

        <docText>PERIODICALLY, some form of cheating rises to the surface to blemish the sport 
of horse racing. Few methods have been as blatantly abusive to the horse as 
blood doping with epoetin alfa, a synthetic form of the body?s natural 
erythropoietin, which can be fatal when given to a healthy horse. Epoetin alfa is 
considered a life-saving drug for humans with severe anemia and is better known by 
the trademarks Epogen and Procrit. 
Natural erythropoietin is a protein produced by the kidneys that circulates 
through the bloodstream to the bone marrow, where it stimulates production of 
red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. 
Muscles require oxygen to function properly. When muscles are used to such an 
extent that the cardiovascular system cannot keep up with the needed supply 
of oxygen, a waste product, lactic acid, is produced that causes muscle 
fatigue-the burning you feel when a muscle tires. The greater the amount of 
circulating red blood cells in the body, the greater is the body?s capacity to deliver 
the needed oxygen; therefore, as long as the oxygen supply is able to keep up 
with oxygen demand, muscles do not tire. </docText>

        <docText>When communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was shot 
dead Christmas Day in 1989, it could have been good news for the bears -- he 
had shot hundreds of them. And now the government finds so many bears around 
that hunters are being asked to shoot them again. 

The government announced last week that it would allow hunters to shoot 300 
of Romania's estimated 5,300 bears this year. 

Local environmentalists oppose the move. They say the bear population has 
been overestimated. 

?A bear usually covers between 15 to 20 kilometres in a single night and 
could be counted up to three times by different forest wardens,? says Laszlo 
Szabo- Szeley, president of the environmental group Aves. 

Szeley believes that the brown bear population of Romania has fallen 60 
percent over the last three to four years. The bears are being hunted down already, 
he says. ?It's probably partial or complete extinction of this species in the 
next decade.? 

Aves has launched a campaign to save the Carpathian brown bear. But 
environmentalists face strong opposition from officials. 

Hunting was the privilege of the elite in communist times, and the situation 
is not very different now. Prime Minister Adrian Nastase is also president of 
a hunters' association. Agriculture minister Ilie Sarbu who handles 
environmental matters shot himself in the thigh in a hunting accident Dec. 27. 

Romania is drawing hunters from all around. Over recent years an increasing 
number have come from Germany, Spain, Italy and Austria in expensive group 
tours to hunt stags, brown bears and wolves. Romania is one of the last European 
countries with plenty of what hunters call game. 

The country earned more than six million dollars from hunting expeditions 
last year, officials say. Foreign hunters will spend thousands of dollars to 
shoot a bear. 

?We expect at least the same earnings in 2004 because Romania is an 
interesting hunting place for those who want to bag something really exotic,? says 
Arpad Sarkanz who owns a company providing hunting services. </docText>

Americans and Western Europeans have had a lock on unsustainable 
over-consumption for decades. But now developing countries are catching up rapidly, to the 
detriment of the environment, health, and happiness, according to the 
Worldwatch Institute in its annual report, State of the World 2004. 
Perfectly timed after the excesses of the holiday season, the report put out 
by the Washington, D.C.-based research organization focuses this year on 
consumerism run amuck. 
Approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide now belong to the "consumer class"?
the group of people characterized by diets of highly processed food, desire 
for bigger houses, more and bigger cars, higher levels of debt, and lifestyles 
devoted to the accumulation of non-essential goods. 
  

 
The world is consuming goods and services at an unsustainable pace, with 
serious consequences for the well-being of people and the planet, reports the 
Worldwatch Institute in its annual report, State of the World 2004. Around 1.7 
billion people worldwide?more than a quarter of humanity?have entered the 
"consumer class," adopting the diets, transportation systems, and lifestyles that 
were limited to the rich nations of Europe, North America, and Japan during most 
of the last century. In China alone, 240 million people have joined the ranks 
of consumers?a number that will soon surpass that in the United States.

As homes are built higher and higher on the bench areas along the Front and 
elsewhere in Utah, the natural living environment of such animals as moose, 
deer and mountain lions is compromised. They were here first, and, yes, the 
foothills are part of their natural habitat. They tend to spend summers higher in 
the mountains and move to lower elevations in winter where feed is more 
abundant. 
    At least, that's the way their normal migration habits were before 
asphalt, concrete, houses and all things human covered the terrain. Now what forage 
is found by moose or deer when they are adventurous enough -- or hungry enough 
-- often consists of the ornamental bushes and trees in the yards of the 
interlopers who have moved in on their territory. 
    The cow moose was tranquilized and removed to higher ground after 
homeowners called the state Division of Wildlife Resources. An aged and emaciated 
mountain lion that killed a dog near Holladay Boulevard on Saturday was 
tranquilized and eventually put down after it was determined she was unhealthy and 
probably would not live much longer. Two deer that were injured during a foray 
into the east benches of Davis County last week also had to be euthanized. 
The same is happening elsewhere. In California, a mountain biker was killed 
and another badly mauled by a mountain lion last week. </docText>

    More than 100 monkeys were involved in experiments at the University of 
Utah between October 1998 and February 2003. Some primates were as young as 6 
months old. 
    But good luck finding out what was done to them. 
    The school's attorney says that information, and the researchers who 
gather it, should be protected -- from public disclosure, from curious competitors 
and from people such as Jeremy Beckham. 
    Beckham, 18, a freshman and budding biologist is, nonetheless, upset 
about animal testing. Taxpayers would be, too, Beckham insists, if they knew what 
was taking place in laboratories funded with federal grants and state money, 
like those at the U. 
    Last fall, Beckham filed an open-records request for research protocols 
containing blow-by-blow descriptions of experiments involving primates, 
including what anesthesia is used on the animals, whether they are restrained, and 
what kind of post-operative care they receive. 
    Beckham plans to publish the information on his Web site. The ultimate 
goal, he says, is to generate enough public outrage that the school ends 
experimentation on baboons, macaques, marmosets and other monkeys. In October, he 
founded the Utah Primate Freedom Project. The Web site describes it as "a 
collection of concerned university students, alumni and laypersons," but that's a bit 
overstated. 
    "Right now, it's me and a couple of friends," Beckham says. 
    That's apparently enough to make the university nervous.</docText>

Below the drumbeat of reassurances from government and the cattle industry
that the meat supply remains safe despite this one case of mad cow
disease, a small universe of scientists working on a family of related
illnesses is finding disturbing evidence to the contrary.

Several studies, including research at a government laboratory in Montana,
continue to spark questions about human susceptibility not only to mad
cow, but also to sister diseases such as chronic wasting disease, which
mainly affects deer and elk, and scrapie, which infects sheep. 
...
Most scientists believe the relatively small number of known human cases,
called Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, strongly indicates this disease --
whatever its cause or origin -- is rare and difficult to transmit. There
is also no evidence yet that scrapie in sheep or chronic wasting disease
in deer has ever been passed to humans.

But some scientists say it's possible that chronic wasting, endemic in
Colorado's wild deer and elk, has sickened and proved fatal to humans.
These experts challenging the standard view note that doctors haven't --
or can't -- recognize signs of these other forms of the disease during an
autopsy. 
...
It's long been believed, for example, that only one of the two versions of
human CJD can be linked to eating meat contaminated with mad cow disease.
The other version, known as sporadic or classical CJD, has long been
thought to occur randomly in about one in every million people, a
distinctive illness with no link to meat from an infected animal.

But a few studies in the past three years have challenged that view,
suggesting that classical CJD, might, in some cases, also result from
eating contaminated meat.

Scientists in Great Britain injected tissue from a cow with mad cow
disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalapothy, into mice whose
brains were genetically engineered with human genes. One set of mice fell
sick with the human form of mad cow, or new variant CJD. 
...
"Given the new research showing that infected beef may be responsible for
some (classical) CJD, thousands of Americans may already be dying because
of mad cow disease every year," wrote Dr. Michael Greger, a physician and
vegan advocate.</docText>

Most people don't know this, but the National Western Stock Show is also a
convention of various species of livestock. During visiting hours, the
cattle, sheep and swine just stand around looking pretty, but in the wee
hours of the morning, they assemble to discuss current issues and how they
might best respond.

Few people have been privileged to observe these deliberations, but over
the years, I've made some good connections - among them, a grumpy old
Hereford range bull who smuggled me in to the American Bovine Congress in
a small building off Washington Street on Sunday night.

About two dozen cattle, representing all the well-known breeds and a few
that aren't, were present when the chairsteer, a Texas Longhorn whose moo
had a twangy drawl, called the meeting to order and explained the agenda:
"First, we have to determine whether there is an outbreak of Mad Human
Disease in the United States. Then, if there is, we must decide how to
respond to it. So, if anyone has any evidence one way or another, take the
floor."
...
"But what about PETA? Those crazy humans want to take away that good life
of yours. They say you're being abused and tortured."

The Bucking Bull admitted that it was one of his great pleasures to break
a human leg or neck every so often, so he couldn't see how that was abuse.
Thus he agreed that PETA could be a symptom of Mad Human Disease.

Tribune reader Michael Welch recently took the paper to task for running a
story about the Democratic presidential hopefuls that, in his words,
"presented mostly facile tidbits about personal lives and individual
style, while barely exploring candidates' positions on substantive issues."

Welch also complained the story focused on U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich's
vegan diet while ignoring his position in support of a Canadian-style,
single-payer health care system.

Simmer down, Mr. Welch. I promise you that before the Wisconsin primary
Feb. 17, the Tribune will publish many substantive issue-oriented stories
about the candidates.

I also want to pick a bone with Mr. Welch for his statement that "anyone
voting for or against a candidate based upon dietary preferences would
obviously be a fool!"

You wouldn't want to judge every candidate based solely on his or her
eating habits. But in some cases, diet might say more about a politician
than a Big Mac-high stack of position papers.

Kucinich's vegan diet ? which means he doesn't eat animal products,
including milk and eggs ? says a great deal about the candidate, his world
view and his commitment to the environment. Not all voters might agree
with those views, but nobody can argue that Kucinich doesn't live ? and
eat ? his values. How many politicians can you say that about these days?

It's tough to get close to patas monkeys. Wily and skittish, they bolt at the 
sight of humans. The leggy monkeys, clocked at 34 miles an hour (55 
kilometers an hour), easily eluded primatologist Lynne Isbell when she arrived in Kenya 
in 1992. "I thought I could keep up on a horse or a bicycle, but trees got in 
the way," she says. After six months of patient tracking on foot, Isbell was 
finally able to sit within yards of one patas group that lived on the Laikipia 
Plateau. And so began a ten-year mission?the longest continuous field study 
of little-known Erythrocebus patas. 

As if on a high-speed biological clock, patas monkeys live fast, reproducing 
at the earliest age of any Old World monkey. Female patas reach sexual 
maturity at age two-and-a-half and give birth at three. Babies can survive alone at 
just six months, though they'll nurse for up to a year. Meanwhile, mothers mate 
and give birth again, every year. So a patas could be pregnant, nursing a 
baby, and shepherding a frisky juvenile all at the same time. 

As mothers, patas range from doting to cavalier, says Isbell. They routinely 
hand off very young infants to other females, who babysit while the mother 
forages. But if an uninvited female comes too close to a baby, the mother will 
open her mouth, a silent threat meaning "keep away." </docText>

        <docText>By now, pretty much everyone in the United States has heard of
the Holstein from Mabton, Wash., found to be infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as ?mad cow disease.? What
people may not know is how this disease that devastated the British beef
industry in the ?90s has been allowed to spread to Washington state.

After all, don?t we have governmental agencies set up to protect our food,
such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)? Yes, we do have these agencies, but anyone who has
wondered what ill-effects the push for ?less government? has gotten us
need look no further. 
...
Presidential contender Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), who, incidentally,
is a vegetarian, has devoted a web page to mad cow disease which states,
?Last year, the USDA tested only 19,990 cattle believed to be at risk for
mad cow disease, out of a population of about 96 million or 1 out of every
5,000 cattle. By contrast, in Europe every single animal above a given age
gets tested for this fatal brain-wasting disease (one out of every four
cattle).?

Kucinich proposes seven new steps to help make meat safer: Prohibit meat
from downer cattle from entering the human food supply; test all downer
cattle (estimates range from 190,000 to 970,000 animals) using modern
rapid quick tests; establish a mandatory trace back system for all
bovines; require mandatory recall of food products infected; prohibit the
feeding of the remains of any mammal to any animals that humans eat;
tighten the law on dietary supplements, which currently allows supplements
to contain central nervous system tissue; and require doctors and
hospitals to report all cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob (mad cow) to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

All of these measures would enhance public health but would also cut into
the meatpacking industry?s fat corporate profits. Hence the resistance. </docText>

        <docText>From a $50 million arson at a San Diego condominium to four 
chickens liberated from a California egg farm, radical environmental groups 
had a busy year - but with a difference. 
While the Pacific Northwest was their focus for years, they now seem to have 
virtually abandoned the region, spreading their violent political action 
through the rest of the country, according to a list of actions released Wednesday 
by the groups. 
The FBI considers the two largest groups, the Animal Liberation Front and the 
Earth Liberation Front, to be terrorist organizations. 
"All I can tell you is that they are moving out around the country," said 
Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman in Washington, D.C. 
In an e-mail sent to news media, the radical groups listed actions from Maine 
to California and from Louisiana to Alaska. 
The groups claimed responsibility for 75 actions in 2003. Only one - 10,000 
mink freed from a fur farm in Sultan, Wash., by the Animal Liberation Front - 
was in the Pacific Northwest. No ELF actions were near the Northwest forests 
where the group had flourished since it was founded. Until last year the fronts 
struck often against logging operations, Forest Service facilities, fur farms, 
slaughterhouses and other targets in the region.</docText>

Winter in the north-east of Scotland can get very cold indeed. The sea breeze 
coupled with a near Arctic frost often makes you wish that you had a warm and 
toasty layer of fur to keep you that little bit warmer. 
I was still extremely surprised, however, when on Hogmanay a friend of mine 
turned up to meet our group wearing a 1950s style three-quarter length 
rabbit-lined leather coat with warm and luxurious fur trimmings adorning the collar 
and cuffs, abundantly suitable for the cold of the outdoor party we were heading 
for.

Throughout the evening, this rather spectacular item caused a lot of comment, 
from admiration to disgust, but the fact that it was being worn at all was an 
indication of changing attitudes towards fur as a fashion statement. 
For many years wearing fur has been the kind of sartorial political 
incorrectness that would see celebrities blacklisted from fashion pages across the 
land. The use of fur in fashion is an emotive issue in a way that leather is not: 
comparatively few people would think twice about purchasing leather shoes, 
coats and other accessories yet many find the notion of wearing fur quite 
repellent.

of Hamilton County shows no dissatisfaction among officials in communities 
served by the animal shelter.
"The ones I've talked with have had no problem or rejections," said Fred 
Swift, administrative assistant to the Hamilton County Commissioners.
Swift has been directed by the commissioners to determine whether the 
nonprofit agency is meeting terms of its contract to shelter stray and unwanted pets 
brought in by animal control officers.
The directive came Monday, as commissioners addressed the shelter's contract 
for 2004 and a complaint of mismanagement by the organization's former public 
relations coordinator.
Commissioners agreed to sign the contract, which could pay up to $293,000 
this year, but they also sought assurances that the agency had met its 
obligations.</docText>

        <docText>It was the kind of day where you don't take your gloves off too long or you 
will start to lose feeling in your fingers, but the bison didn't seem to mind. 
Standing just inside the glass door to the gift shop, Paul Ciaglo pointed past 
the pen where his bison were huddled to a hayfield across a depression. 
Barren now in winter, the 18-acre lot is where he and his brother Fred hope a new 
Lowe's home improvement store will be built. But first, voters in Hadley will 
have to agree to redraw the current business zone, which only extends 500 feet 
back from Route 9. 
It's by no means a foregone conclusion. The past six months have seen Hadley 
residents voice questions about the need for more "big box" retailers on 
traffic-clogged Route 9. Two previous town meetings have blocked the rezoning 
effort, which needs a two-thirds majority to pass. But the Ciaglos hope that the 
third time -- this Saturday, Jan. 17 -- will be the charm. More is on the line 
for them than just money. When they inked a deal with Paradigm Development 
Inc., they promised the developer retail-ready land one way or the other. So if 
the rezone effort fails, they will sell the whole farm. 
As Paul Ciaglo looked out at his young herd, he explained that bison can live 
for 30 years or more. The farm currently holds about 65 head of bison. While 
he said 10 to 15 bison are slaughtered a year for the meat, breeding stock are 
retained. The oldest bison on the farm right now is about 10 years old.</docText>

        <docText>Pike County Sheriff Larry Travis doesn't expect to file charges 
against the owner of 52 horses he seized late last week after complaints of 
neglect. 
Travis seized the animals and the Long Fork Road barn in which they are 
housed Friday with the cooperation of the owner, Columbus resident Ivan Orozco, who 
declined to comment for this report. 
In mid-December, area animal rights workers brought the horses to Travis' 
attention, who said he checked up on the animals about every other day. 
Veterinarian Kristen Rohde, founder of the group Ohio Horse Rescue, told 
county commissioners Jan. 5 she had found the horses to be severely underfed, with 
only a 1 1/2 bales of hay for the entire herd to share, with one dead in its 
stall and another following closely behind. She took the most severely ill 
horse to care for it herself with the owner's consent in mid-December and could 
not be reached for further comment or the condition of the horse. 
"The original complaint, it was my understanding, that 50 of these horses are 
starving, and that's just not the case," said County Prosecutor Rob Junk. He 
said it seems there was no intent to cause harm to the animals, but that it 
was a matter of inexperience with caring for horses. 
"Looking at that, there wasn't any intent for anybody to hurt or starve any 
animal or anything like that, but especially based on these people's 
cooperation on this, we aren't looking at any charges now," he said. </docText>

        <docText>Lacie Hulbert (left) and Carlee Marble, both freshmen at La Conner High 
School, contemplate school lunch without beef. La Conner schools have put 
their beef products on hold until they can double-check that none of the 
meat is connected with a mad cow case in Central Washington. On the menu 
Tuesday was grilled cheese and tomato soup.
There's no cow in school chow

La Conner High School students have a major beef about the lack of beef on 
their school menu for the last week and a half.

But while students may be getting mad, school administrators want to be 
extra sure no one is getting mad cow disease.

"I want my nachos to be macho again," said Josh Van Hine, a 17-year-old 
senior.

Sitting across from Van Hine in the La Conner cafeteria, Cameron Vest, 16, 
said he thought the lack of beef was having an adverse affect on his health.

"We need our beef," Vest said, as he took a less-than-satisfying bite into a 
grilled cheese sandwich. "I think I'm having beef withdrawal."

La Conner Superintendent Tim Bruce, after hearing concerns from some 
parents, made the decision to put a hold on district beef when students 
returned from the Christmas holidays.
That first day after break, beef burritos were on the menu. Bruce said he 
wanted to be "extra cautious" in light of the mad cow scare that erupted 
over the holidays when the first U.S. case of the bovine brain disease was 
discovered in a Washington-raised cow.

"We're going to wait two or three weeks to make sure we've got all of our 
information and that all the meat we have in the freezer is in good 
standing," Bruce said. "We just wanted to be extra cautious."

Local cattle ranchers say the school district's reaction is unwarranted.</docText>

Recently a deer tried to cross in front of my car just over the hill south
of Irish Hills golf course. It didn?t make it.

All I saw was the flash of a deer head against the right front fender,
then the sound as the animal hit the right side of my car. The right side
mirror was damaged, there was a large dent in the right front door, and
molding pulled loose and bent sheet metal around the right rear wheel
opening. It didn?t look like that much damage, but the tab came to $2,448.

Before the settlers ravaged what is now Ohio, the land was 85 percent
forest, most of it densely covered, a forest that contained a wide variety
of wildlife. The wildlife was a carefully balanced ecosystem that evolved
over eons and kept the population of animals and game birds in check. Part
of that system were cougar and lynx, which were very efficient predators
at keeping the deer population in check.
...
As I said, there are simply too many deer in the county. So what?s the
next move, if any? Well, extending the hunting season and increasing the
number of deer allowed each hunter would bring down the population. But
would that bring the census down to a reasonable level?

Probably not, in my opinion. Thinning out the herd would seem to be an
alternative. But try getting that past the animal rights activists, or
even the governor. Maybe we could get the Ohio Legislature in on this ?
make it illegal for a deer to run into a car.</docText>

A person gets the "mad cow" disease by eating the infected tissue of a
slaughtered animal. Abnormal proteins in the cow's flesh distort normal
proteins in the human brain and nervous system. The disease begins making
small holes throughout the human brain, causing an infected person to
first suffer hallucinations, followed by blindness and epilepsy and
eventually suffer total loss of faculties. The infected person will then die.
...
Animal rights groups, concerned citizen organizations and some lawmakers
have begun to step up pressure on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to implement stricter cattle-monitoring procedures such as those in place
in Japan, where every cow to be slaughtered is tested for disease, and
animals are not fed the remains of others-the main way "mad cow" is spread
among livestock. 
...
Officials at the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) recently released a
statement saying that commissaries did not receive any beef from the herds
now under quarantine.

"No beef in any of our 275 commissaries worldwide has been involved in a
USDA recall," said Col. Mark Wolken, chief of public health, safety and
security for DeCA. "The USDA has stated that the U.S. beef supply is safe
and that the beef recall resulted from an abundance of caution, not fear
that the meat is infected. Should the USDA make a determination that there
is danger, DeCA would be the first to react to protect the health of our
customers," he said. </docText>

        <docText>yoming legislators reacted in anger and frustration Thursday as they told 
visiting federal officials the state?s wolf management plan was being held 
hostage to cater to special interest groups. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service notified the Wyoming government on Tuesday 
that wolves would not be removed from the Endangered Species Act list until 
Wyoming amends its current wolf management plan. 
The federal government wants the classification of wolves changed from ?
predatory animals? to ?trophy game.? 
But treating wolves like predators is at the heart of Wyoming?s current plan, 
which allows residents in most of the state to kill wolves on sight. 
Only wolves in northwest Wyoming would be classified as trophy animals, 
subject to the same hunting regulations that apply to mountain lions and bears ? a 
hunting license would be needed. 
The federal government wants the same definition to now extend to the rest of 
the state.</docText>

The good news is that cats are living longer and longer. Ten years ago a cat 
would have been considered geriatric at 10-12 years old. Nowadays, veterinary 
surgeons commonly treat cats of 16 years and even up to 22-23 years. 

Vaccination: The main diseases we vaccinate cats against are Cat flu, Feline 
Enteritis and Feline Leukaemia. As your cat reaches old age it may no longer 
be at risk of getting Feline Enteritis and Feline Leukaemia, but I would 
strongly recommend annual vaccination against Cat flu. Cat flu is very much a 
disease of the young and ageing cat. Like elderly people if an old cat gets a dose 
of flu it can become extremely debilitated and require intensive nursing and 
sometimes intravenous fluids.

Fleas: Old age does not stop the fleas so carry on with regular flea control. 
Most modern flea products act against insects only and are relatively safe 
for the elderly cat. Discuss the safest form of flea control with your vet.

        <docText>Paris has the boulevards. Rome has the fountains. But here, well, 
they've got the pigs. 
Lots of pigs. Big ones. Wild ones. They don't call them pigs, of course. 
Here, they're called Wildschwein, which translates to wild pigs, or wild boars. 
And they're all over the news these days. 
Look in Der Tagesspiegel and there's a picture of a momma boar, OK, a sow, 
suckling five piglets. She's resting against the passenger side wheel of a 
sedan, which is parked in front of an apartment building. A few days ago, in 
southwestern Berlin, a 54-year-old man encountered a boar, of all places, hiding 
under his dining room table. The boar bit him when he tried to shoo it away. 
Boars are not cute creatures. Typically weighing between 200 and 300 pounds, 
they can be aggressive, using their five-inch tusks as weapons ? especially 
females with litters. 
Berliners like to say their boars rarely attack, and many residents put out 
food for them or don't complain as they root through a city park or private 
garden. Some note that the boars line up outside doors, like pets, waiting for 
their meals. 
That has meant closer encounters with human residents. In recent months, 
they've been spotted in the center of what was old East Berlin, Alexanderplatz. 
"There were two of them, hunting for food," said Marc Franusch of the Berlin 
forest administration. "They had some people worried." </docText>

        <docText>When we lived in Japan, they had this delicacy called fugu ? puffer fish.
Only a licensed chef could make this dish, because a slip of the knife
rendered it more toxic than cyanide. If it?s prepared correctly, diners
feel euphoric after eating fugu. If not, diners get dizzy, their mouths
tingle, they can?t breathe and then they die.

Dangerous. But people still ate it. I didn?t. But other people did. 
...
On Dec. 23, one American cow tested positive for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy ? mad cow disease. The USDA recalled the entire day?s meat
production from that company. Eating meat from mad cows may cause humans
to develop an illness that causes depression, psychosis and immobility
before death.

Scary. But people still ate it. I didn?t. But other people 
 

Wait a minute.

Let?s think about this. 
...
Because I?m not likely to give up my burger any time soon ? even if it is
poisonous. I?m likely to take up living on the edge. Likely to start
making my own ground chuck. Likely to start up a dangerous little
Hamburger Club on the edge of town ? with hot jazz seeping into the alley.
One where you?d have to recite the ingredients of a Big Mac to get in.

With my new, edgy, illegal, burger-driven lifestyle, I?m likely to be
deported to a country where they don?t even have the USDA. Just for spite,
I?ll set up an Americatown for expatriated burger-eating Americans.
Patrons will sit at stools made of pickle tubs. Old Glory will swathe the
walls. Little tubs of cholesterol will burn in dishes on the table. And
the people of the world will come a-knockin? at my door.

        <docText>Few could escape the shocking revelation over the festive period that one of 
the Queen's corgis was mauled by one of Princess Anne's terriers. As gloom 
descended over Sandringham, much of the nation responded to the story with an 
unseemly schadenfreude. 
A reader in The Guardian paid tribute to Dotty and Florence, "who have made 
everyone's Christmas so entertaining." The great British love of pets is 
tempered by a disdain for sentimentality: the darkest sin of the postmodern age. No 
wonder the Dotty episode -- with its batty owners and mad, bad, dangerous and 
much cosseted dogs, caused such glee.

Q. We have two mixed-breed dogs in a large, fenced-in area. Right now the 
area is grass, which they like to dig holes in every now and then. With all of 
the running back and forth it gets ruts, and when it rains it all turns to mud.
What is the best material to build a dog run out of? I don't want their paws 
to get hurt, yet I'd like to keep it from getting all muddy. 
A. Compacted dirt or clay with a 4-inch layer of sand covered by a 3- to 
4-inch layer of pea gravel held in place with a low wall of bricks or railroad 
ties makes for a suitable ground cover that drains and dries easily. 
Alternatively, smooth cement or patio-style wood slats, set no more than 1/3-inch apart 
over a layer of sand and rock chips, would be a good, albeit more permanent, 
alternative. Part of the run should ideally be covered to give shade and shelter, 
or you should provide a box-type kennel.</docText>

In a small corner of Kenya, where banditry and poaching were once rife, a 
unique conservation project supported by Tusk Trust has brought hope and security 
to humans and animals alike. W F Deedes reports

Africa's darkness is often lit by candles we don't see. This is a candle, I 
thought, as Ian Craig drove us through the Sarara valley in northern Kenya, one 
of the wildlife conservation areas in the region that he has inspired. It was 
such a beautiful African evening, sunny, silent, still. Not a leaf stirring.
 
Wildlife haven: W F Deedes makes friends with a cheetah
"It's been quiet here for five years," says Craig. Before that, the bandits 
had taken charge. "Gangs of 20 or more," he reflects, as we drive past two 
giraffes that eye us calmly.
"They know they're safe," I murmur.
"They're learning that they're safe," amends Ian.
"The bandits," he resumes, "rendered human and animal life intolerable. 
Foreign invaders made this area impossible. They stole cattle, killed elephants for 
their ivory - and anyone who got in the way. They had no hesitation in 
killing policemen. They were very aggressive."</docText>

To the Editor: 01/09/2004



I would like to respond to a letter that appeared in your Nov. 21 edition 
entitled, "Trapping may be legal, but is it moral?"

Like many articles condemning hunting, trapping and even fishing, it is over 
dramatized and under factualized. The author correctly states that leg hold 
traps are legal on private land, and I bet the owner is having a problem with 
the loss of livestock due to predators. The main predators that threaten 
livestock in Rhode Island are foxes and coyotes, neither of which could be caught in 
a conibear, or quick-kill traps as they are often called. They are far too 
wary.

The author has lost pet cats, and I truly do sympathize with the loss of a 
pet, they are like members of the family. However, I wonder if she is aware of 
the fact that all of those missing pet posters she see are largely the result 
of coyote attacks, far more than those caught in traps, legholds or otherwise. 
Additionally, if she is such an animal lover, why are her pets free to roam in 
such a dangerous environment as opposed to the safety of her own property?

I have, in the past, driven behind a fish farm lorry for half an hour along 
the long slow roads of the Outer Hebrides. European money has improved 
stretches of them. You suddenly find yourself on a double-width, unnaturally 
expensive-looking surface, with unnecessarily large gravelled verges, and you give 
thanks to Brussels for its structural funds and its love affair with the poor 
outer margins of the Continent, before returning to the narrow, indigenous strip 
of tarmac, somehow paid for in the distant past by the Western Isles council.
That is one of the moments when the reality of modern fish-farming hits home. 
The old road is not the lovely, moneyed euro carpet. It is bumpy and, at each 
bump, the large plastic containers on the lorry in front of you are given a 
little jerk. They contain dead, mature salmon, being driven from the farm to 
the processing plant. But the fish are swimming in their own blood and, at each 
bump, the blood slops out of the containers, on to the back of the lorry, and 
sprays the car behind.
You have to keep your wipers going to see through the blood. The whole front 
of your car is sticky with it afterwards. It is like a horror film, weirdly 
overstated in its crudity. These blood-bumps are like the evidence of a body in 
the boot, a horrible slopping-out of a hidden fact.
Why is this so disgusting? Partly, I think, it is a question of deceit. Go 
into your average supermarket and look at the images with which salmon is sold: 
fresh, Scottish, beautiful and, above all, clean. You won't find any pictures 
of windscreens coated in blood, nor, as I have seen, of salmon still alive and 
thrashing in containers filled to the brim with their own and other fish's 
blood. Perhaps only in eggs and chickens is there a greater gulf between the 
realities of production and the deceptions of the chill cabinet.</docText>

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) appears to be trying to 
sneak one by us again. Seems the no-fishing Marine Protected Areas (MPA) idea 
just won?t die?even though a number of top researchers have professed that 
MPAs do nothing to really advance fish stocks. That is, with one 
exception--establishing a boundary or boundaries that commercial bottom fishers will work 
nonstop. 
SAFMC will hold nine ?informational? public hearings starting January 19 ?to 
collect input from area fishermen (this includes recreational, family-level 
anglers) that may be impacted by the designation of MPAs in federal waters.? 
Rules being considered for these deepwater MPAs include no bottom fishing for 
several species?snowy grouper, speckled hind and golden tilefish. At this 
time, surface trolling for pelagic gamefish such as dolphin, tuna and sailfish 
will still be allowed. </docText>

        <docText>Lea Jaunakais' office looks a bit like Animal Planet. 
Her walls, desk and cabinets are adorned with photos of lions, leopards, 
jaguars, pythons and other wild creatures.
But her heart belongs to a striped beast with paws that can reach the size of 
a human head.
"Ever since I was a child, I've had this love and infatuation with tigers," 
said Jaunakais, 27, whose day job is serving as vice president of her family's 
Rock Hill company, Industrial Test Systems.
Her weekends are spent caring for tigers at the Metrolina Zoo in Rowan 
County, N.C., northeast of Charlotte.
She's in charge of three young tigers: Avalon and Brandy, both orange 
Bengals, and Diamond, a white Bengal. Her duties include training and feeding the 
animals and cleaning their cages. She's also helping build a spacious tiger 
enclosure with a waterfall, pool and trees native to the creatures' natural habitat.
"I want to be a major part of the preservation of the tiger," she said. Her 
goal: to let the animals live comfortably in captivity. It pains her to visit 
places where the majestic creatures are cooped up in tiny cages with cement 
floors.
There are fewer than 3,000 wild tigers worldwide, versus almost 12,000 in 
captivity in the United States. Nearly all captive tigers have been bred in 
captivity. It is illegal to capture a wild one. In some poor countries, however, 
people kill tigers to sell their teeth, claws and coat.</docText>

The Penn researchers have used gene therapy on these mice to produce 
increased levels of IGF-1, or insulinlike growth factor-1, a protein that promotes 
muscle growth and repair. They have done this with mice before birth and with 
mice at four weeks of age. A result has been a sort of rodent fountain of youth. 
The mice show greater than normal muscle size and strength and do not lose it 
as they age. Rats altered in the same fashion and then put into physical 
training -- they climb little ladders with weights strapped to their backs -- have 
experienced a 35 percent strength gain in the targeted muscles and have not 
lost any of it ''detraining,'' as a human being will when he quits going to the

        <docText> Christina Haire and her family, who were burned out of their 
Effort home in December, have disappeared like smoke, according to Stacy Keeney 
of Creature Comforts in Saylorsburg. 
Creature Comforts, a veterinary clinic, took in the Haire family's three pit 
bulls on Dec. 10. The family was staying at the Pocono View Inn in Sciota 
after their home burned to the ground.
Haire, her husband George, and son William Harris, 15, watched their home of 
a year and half burn.
Various community agencies and individuals assisted the Haires with food, 
clothing, and shelter. Creature Comforts, though it had no previous relationship 
with the family, took in the dogs.
Now, Creature Comforts wants to know if they want two of the dogs back.
"At this point, they seem to have abandoned their dogs here," Keeney said.
Keeney said that the family showed interest in the well-being of the dogs and 
even came and picked up the oldest of the three dogs, Lukie, on Jan. 5. 
"They called and checked on these animals," Keeney said.</docText>

        <docText>In a letter written to Department 
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Secretary Tommy Thompson, the American 
Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) has called for an immediate halt on studies 
involving xenotransplantation, the transplanting of organs, cells, and tissues 
from a member of one species into a member of another species. AAVS sent the 
letter to Secretary Thompson in response to a paper published on Jan. 8, 2004, in 
the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal.
The study found that pigs, who had been injected with human stem cells while 
in utero, exhibit pig (porcine), human, and hybrid (porcine/human) cells in 
their organs and blood. This is the first time that cell fusion has been 
observed in live animals. According to the study's authors, Ogle, et al., "the 
hybrids contain the porcine endogenous retrovirus and are able to transmit the virus 
to uninfected human cells." This retrovirus is considered to be a distant 
relative Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV.</docText>

A single case of Mad Cow disease on a dairy farm in the United States last
month has sent shock waves through the nation's $175 billion beef
industry. But as journalist and veterinarian Mark Jermone Walters claims
in his book Six Modern Plagues: and How we Are Causing Them Mad Cow is
just part of a wave of new global infections. Since the Washington state
mad cow incident was first reported last month, 36 countries have banned
the import of U.S. beef and a study by the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association reports a 15 percent drop in cattle prices, a significant
shock to the U.S. farm economy.

A CNN-Time poll released last week says 27 percent of Americans have
either reduced their consumption of beef or stopped eating it altogether.
...
"And so you find this whole range of new infections, from old to new that
is reconfiguring itself. It is mutating," said Mr. Walters. "There is some
reason that this is all happening together. And the reason is that we have
made radical changes in the environment and thereby put humans in the way
of diseases that evolutionarily did not tend to mess [bother] us very much."

Mr. Walters says in his introduction to the book that the larger story is
not simply that humans and other animals are falling victims to new
diseases, but that humans and animals are causing these diseases or making
them worse.
...
Mark Jerome Walters, author of Six Modern Plagues: And How We Are Causing
Them. He says, "human health does not belong to us alone. Nor,
unfortunately," he adds, "do the plagues we are all now experiencing."</docText>

When the news broke on December 23 that a cow infected with bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a.k.a. mad cow disease, had been discovered 
in Washington state, meat producers and merchants moved into crisis-control 
mode. The disease, which literally eats holes in its victims&#x2019; brains, has 
infected some 180,000 cattle in Britain and is blamed for the deaths of 
nearly 150 people there. The American meat industry needed to convince the 
public that its beef was still safe to eat &#x2014; especially since dozens of 
countries had immediately banned imports of the stuff.

Washington lobbyists with the cattle industry&#x2019;s main political advocacy 
group, the National Cattlemen&#x2019;s Beef Association (NCBA), fanned out to 
contact members of Congress and Agriculture Department officials &#x2014; many of 
them at home for the holidays &#x2014; to strategize a response. Association 
spokespeople were deployed in all 50 states to make the case to the media 
that the public was in no danger. A special Web site focusing on BSE &#x2014; 
created years ago for just such a crisis &#x2014; went up on the NCBA&#x2019;s official 
site, beef.org, according to spokeswoman Michele Peterson. Perturbed by all 
the images on TV of obviously sick cows taken during BSE outbreaks in 
Britain, the association hired its own crews to film sleek American cattle 
grazing contentedly in lush pastures, then sent the footage to the national 
networks, cable news shows and local stations.

&#x201c;This is all really a nonissue,&#x201d; insists Dan Murphy, a spokesman for the 
American Meat Institute, the meatpacking industry&#x2019;s trade group, which has 
also been busy downplaying public fears. &#x201c;There is no threat to public 
health. Beef is safe. The flames have been fanned by misguided media 
coverage, and by activists with agendas &#x2014; the kind of people who want to 
turn us all into vegetarians or denounce corporate globalization and the WTO 
or whatever.&#x201d;

Beef is a $70 billion business in this country, and the people who run it 
are no slouches. Their skill at working both public opinion and politicians 
would make the NRA proud. But the industry&#x2019;s many critics say it often uses 
its clout to stifle detractors and thwart regulations aimed at making its 
products safer &#x2014; all in the interest of keeping the fat in its profits.

Beef producers can be notoriously intolerant of &#x201c;activists with agendas&#x201d; &#x2014; 
as Howard Lyman learned. Lyman, a 65-year-old former rancher turned vegan 
activist, appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1996 and predicted that mad 
cow disease would eventually break out in the U.S., thanks to the cattle 
industry&#x2019;s practice of feeding potentially infected rendered cow parts back 
to other cows. An appalled Oprah promised she would never eat another 
hamburger. That prompted a group of Texas cattlemen to sue her and Lyman 
under a state law making it illegal to criticize food products without a 
basis in &#x201c;reliable scientific inquiry.&#x201d; Texas is one of 13 states that has 
passed similar &#x201c;food libel&#x201d; laws since the early 1990s &#x2014; constitutionally 
questionable statutes that meat interests helped push.

&#x201c;These laws are meant to stifle dissent,&#x201d; says Lyman, who won his case after 
years of litigation. &#x201c;These people have a lot of money invested in 
controlling the media.&#x201d;

The meat industry isn&#x2019;t focused only on influencing public perception; it 
also uses its substantial political power, working the halls of Congress and 
the White House to beat back unwelcome rules and regulations.</docText>

They should have called her Angel, but instead she was given a name more 
reflective of her masters' despicable character, abusive behaviour and 
unconscionable betrayal. 
I don't possess any information about Judith's life before she mistakenly 
arrived at this house of horrors, but I know indisputably that her story holds 
true for innumerable dogs at this very moment. I never met Judith, but her 
tragic beginning implores me to give her a voice, while her heart wrenching image 
propels me to continue advocating on behalf of innocent animals awaiting 
justice. 
Try, if you can, to imagine where you were ten years ago. Remember your 
surroundings, daily activities, ongoing interactions and aspirations. Consider how 
many days and hours you have passed in this decade filled with countless 
experiences and unforgettable memories. 
Now envision yourself restrained by a cold, steel chain bound to your neck 
condemning you to an uninhabitable wooden dog house for ten torturous years. 
This was the life of Judith . . . and of many others like her. </docText>

(Univera, which derives soaps, cosmetics and dietary supplements from aloe 
vera, received no special tax breaks to move to Lacey. It plans to start with 40 
employees -- some from the Colorado base, some new hires from South Sound -- 
in a temporary Hawks Prairie building by July and expand to 150 on a bigger 
37-acre campus nearby within three years.) 
 
As the courting process continued, Shin said, company officials grew more 
enchanted with how eager South Sound economic development officials were to 
recruit Univera. 
"After a time, they said this is a clean, friendly, pro-business state," Shin 
said. 
In its work, Univera does some product testing on mice, said Derek Hall, its 
chief operating officer. For example, the company tests weight-loss and 
diabetic products on mice, he said. 
"We do test on mice to make sure we don't kill somebody," Hall said. "We 
don't do testing on any other animals." 
Hall said the belief that Washington was more interested in recruiting 
Univera than Oregon and California ultimately led to Lacey's being the winning 
location. 
"You go where you feel you're wanted," he said.</docText>

Elk hunting in Montana is going to hell. Wolves are eating all our elk. 
Sportsmen are now facing up to the "idiocy of introducing an indiscriminate killer 
among populations of carefully managed elk, deer, mountain sheep, moose and 
livestock." All this according to the latest edition of the influential 
"American Hunter," a national magazine published by the National Rifle Association.

The lengthy article goes into great detail, quoting "experts" about the fact 
that "the ecosystem north of Yellowstone National Park has been, for all 
practical purposes, sterilized of wildlife" and lamenting that the "severe decline" 
of elk populations were completely predictable. Government biologists, we're 
informed, won't admit the extent of the problem. "Determining levels of wolf 
predation on elk and other big game is not an exact science," after all.</docText>

        <docText>The long, stringy fingers of hydrilla that entwine props, gobble up 
baits, and clog the boat roads, making them virtually impassable, has beaten a 
hasty retreat thanks to the bitterly cold temperatures. 

A quick survey of Iatt Lake, a pristine 7,100-acre lake, belies the fact this 
lake, located in Grant Parish, has a tremendous grass problem. It's a problem 
that is slowly turning a fine fishing lake into a giant puddle of water. 

While there is no visible sight of the alligator weed or hydrilla, the 
obnoxious weed lies just inches below the surface, out of sight, waiting for 
spring-like temperatures that will allow it to multiply and spread. 

"It is as bad as I have seen it," said Wendell Young, who has a camp on the 
lake. "I'm 65 years old and I have been fishing this lake since I got out of 
the Marine Corps in 1960. I can't recall it ever being worse." </docText>

Playhouse on the Square is looking for a dog with a bit of the Bard in his 
bark. 
The theater is casting a canine in its production of "The Wizard of Oz." 
The dog needs to be 15 pounds or less; easy to tote! It needs to be unafraid 
of a crowd, easygoing around people, respond to basic commands and, most 
important, follow Dorothy, preferably without a leash. 
"We're having an open casting call," said Courtney Oliver, public relations 
manager for the theater. "Acting experience isn't necessary." 
But it would help. 
Nothing can steal the spotlight faster than a willful animal or small child 
who ventures off on a tangent. 
Oliver said resumes and photographs aren't necessary unless pet owners want 
to present one to amuse the theater staff. 
The original Toto was played in the classic 1939 movie by a Cairn terrier 
named Terry. Terry appeared in 11 movies, usually cast as an unnamed character 
with the credit "dog." </docText>

Nonresident elk hunters spent nearly $20 million dollars in southwest Montana 
in 2002, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to 
the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

"That's the direct expenditures, for things like gas, food, lodging, 
outfitter fees," said Rob Brooks, director of FWP's responsive management unit in 
Helena. "It does not include license fees or durable goods -- guns, packs, those 
kinds of things."
And it doesn't include the so-called multiplier effect, the idea that money 
ripples through the economy, being spent several times and widely boosting 
prosperity.

"A hunter spends a dollar down there at Bob Ward's in Bozeman, that pays for 
lights, salaries," Brooks said. "The salaries, those employees go out and 
spend that money again.

"It's about two to three times depending on the industry," Brooks said, so 
the hunter spending could mean a $40- to $50-million boost for the economy in 
places like Ennis, Bozeman and Gardiner.</docText>

animals will live on. 
"She died in her favourite spot in her favourite bit of woods," said Jenny

Ms. Ryon discovered the 11-year-old wolf's death on Dec. 22.

few weeks by animal lovers who raised money and cared for the wolves.

If every dog has his day, Doc has had his and then some.
News of the dog's saga of abuse and perseverance sparked outrage and requests 
to adopt the Wisconsin pooch.
It also has prompted a flood of calls to the Pierce County district attorney, 
a surge in adoptions at the Humane Society of Pierce-St. Croix and questions 
about why we care so much about what happens to a 6-month-old black 
Labrador-Dalmatian mix.
"We've had other animal abuse cases, but I don't ever recall anything getting 
this kind of attention," said Pierce County Sheriff Everett Muhlhausen.
Doc's stint in the limelight began earlier this month, when misdemeanor 
charges were filed against three Pierce County men accused of throwing the puppy 
out the window of a car traveling 80 mph last Halloween. The men then allegedly 
kicked the dog when they saw he had survived.</docText>

Thanks to successful breeding experiments at the Krabi Coastal Aquaculture 
Centre, seven species of anemone fish once on the verge of extinction are coming 
back to the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. 
Finding Nemo may have left local theatres, but in the southern sea, a legion 
of brightly-coloured anemone fish, or pla cartoon, only recently arrived. For 
more than a decade, the population of anemone fish in the ocean has been 
shrinking. Thanks to their cuteness, the fish make for popular pets and thus they 
are often harvested from the sea to be sold at fish markets.

These little Nemos are quite vulnerable to environmental changes, though. 
Many suffer from the lengthy transportation times, becoming weak and plagued by 
disease on their way to the market. Most die a few days after being kept in a 
fish tank. </docText>

A US fertility specialist flew into Britain yesterday to announce that he had 
transferred the first cloned embryo into a woman - but he refused to give a 
shred of evidence to back up his astonishing boast. 
With theatrical flair, Dr Panos Zavos, an IVF expert from Kentucky, told a 
packed press conference in London that he had created the first cloned 
pregnancy. He said that he had taken a skin cell from a man and fused it with the egg 
of a 35-year-old woman and that in two weeks' time they would know whether a 
full pregnancy was safely established. 
His announcement was greeted with laughter and disbelief. A scientist 
compared it to recent claims by the alien-loving Raelian sect, who say they have 
created cloned babies. 
No details were given to corroborate Zavos's claim. All he would say is that 
it happened outside Europe and the US and that it took place within the last 
fortnight. </docText>

A conflict dividing a shelter owner and some of her neighbors might prove 
that even good fences don't make make good neighbors when one side of the fence 
leads to million-dollar homes and the other contains 130 dogs of every

Property owners who live near Rory Walter's All Creatures Home for Animals in 
Baileys Harbor are claiming that her shelter has devalued their properties by 
creating an eyesore, a nuisance, a safety hazard and a public health problem. 
Walter, 53, said the concerns are unfounded and have been crafted to hide the 
real reasons for the claims: The neighbors who are complaining don't want to 
live next to an animal shelter, are intolerant of different lifestyles and 
will do whatever they can to get her out of there. </docText>

So many strays, so little time. And money. And volunteers. And space. 
Moore County is unusually rich in the number of animal lovers? groups and 
organizations devoted to helping unwanted animals. 
Some provide shelters and formal adoptions. Others operate out of their homes 
on a shoestring. And a few consist of cell telephone numbers and groups of 
volunteers who manage to get things done without a shelter. 
The most recent count shows no fewer than six active groups, ranging from the 
oldest and best known, Moore Humane Society, to the latest, Sandhills Animal 
Rescue League Inc. 
A couple of people run small shelters out of their homes ? such as Solutions 
for Animals, just over the county line in Hoke. Others lack shelters but 
actively raise money and help pay for spayings and neuterings, such as Animal 
Advocates in Pinehurst. 
?The public is confused as to which group does what, and they are not getting 
the support they need,? says Linda Hubbard of Southern Pines, volunteer 
coordinator for the Moore County Schools</docText>

        <docText>More than 450 game wardens, medical workers and volunteers 
wearing fiberglass protective vests and carrying nets, ropes and guns set out 
Wednesday to conduct a tiger census in the Sundarbans delta in eastern India.

The 6,000-square-mile delta, the world's largest mangrove forest, is divided 
roughly in half between India and Bangladesh. Twenty-three teams will pend 
about a week scouring the forest and collecting tiger footprints, traveling 
mostly by boat and doing their best to avoid attack.

"Tigers here are more aggressive because they have to live in a harsh habitat 
of water and mud," Predeep Vyas, field director of the Sundarbans tiger 
reserve, said in a phone interview. "We have to be very careful in doing the work."

The census is part of Project Tiger, a program the Indian government began in 
1973 to stem poaching, which had decimated the country's tiger population. 
Tigers are valued in the booming markets for ancient Chinese folk remedies made 
from animal parts: A tiger's penis is supposed to enhance sexual prowess, and 
its powdered bone is supposed to be useful in treating rheumatism.</docText>

        <docText>A public hearing has been scheduled on a proposed city 
animal-control law, but the plan already is drawing criticism, particularly for its 
three-dog limit per owner and its required registry of pit bull terriers. 
The public can have a say on the proposal at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 27 at City Hall, 
420 Broadway. 
Objection to the law has surfaced already: About two dozen people, most of 
them opposed to the ordinance, attended a recent Common Council committee 
session and asked Rhinebeck resident Mahlon Goer, a member of the American Dog Owner 
Association, to speak for them. 
Goer described the ordinance as "poorly written" and "poorly conceived." 
She said state laws prohibit municipalities from singling out specific breeds 
for legislative action. 
"A breed-specific law punishes law-abiding citizens and their good dogs and 
does nothing to address those people who don't license their dogs, don't leash 
their dogs or control their dogs," Goer said. "That is the basic objection to 
any law that singles out a breed."</docText>

        <docText>Law-enforcement agencies investigating the mutilation of two 
seals last summer say they have two prime suspects in the case - and possibly 
another mutilated seal. 
A reward fund for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators, 
established in November, has reached $7,850 and is still growing. 
In July and August last year, a harbor seal and a gray seal washed up on the 
shores of Hampton Beach. Both had been skinned and their male genitalia were 
removed. 
Last week, a third seal - also skinned - was found in the waters off Kittery, 
Maine, by a veterinarian. A necropsy is being performed at the New England 
Aquarium to determine if the case is related. 
A total of five seal carcasses have been discovered in the investigation into 
the poaching case. Only two could be positively identified to fit the crime. 
The other carcasses were too badly decomposed to be sure. 
Chris Shoppmeyer, a special agent for the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
said at the time that all five deaths were considered suspicious and that the 
work was that of a professional. 
"They were skinned, with no damage to internal organs," he said. "Whoever did 
this is skilled with a knife." 
Shoppmeyer said the genitalia have a high market value overseas, where they 
are considered to be an aphrodisiac. 
In a news conference on Friday afternoon, U.S. Attorney Tom Colantuono said 
his office is working closely with the other agencies involved to secure an 
arrest. 
"We have received some information from the public that has been helpful," he 
said. "The case has not been solved yet, so we are asking for additional 
public help." </docText>

It wasn't what you'd call an interview. Whoever was manning the keyboard
at the Earth Liberation Front Press Office refused to give his or her name
and insisted on communicating only by e-mail.

Still, it was worth a shot. The ELF released its Underground Direct Action
Totals for 2003 last week - and it turns out that one of the 75 acts of
eco-terrorism across the country occurred one autumn night right here on
the Portland peninsula.
...
It was far from the worst "direct action" taken last year by this
anonymous bowl of mixed nuts. The ELF's self-described "elves" claimed
credit for torching a $50 million, unfinished condominium complex in San
Diego last August, calling it "the largest act of environmental sabotage
in U.S. history."

Nor was it the most imaginative. Just after Thanksgiving, a splinter group
calling itself the "Vegan Dumpster Militia" left a pharmaceutical company
executive's house "covered in dumpstered food."
...
Final question: You say on your Web site that an ELF member could be
anyone - including "your partner." Is there something my wife isn't
telling me?

"The point is, you have no way of knowing who is involved," replied ELFPO.
"The ELF and other underground activists blend in on every level out of
necessity."

(Of course they do. Much as ELFPO and friends can't stand the American way
of life, it's a pretty comfy place to hide.)</docText>

My doctor's thin face came from behind my chart. "Why haven't you been 
renewing your estrogen patch?" I shivered in my blue paper clothes. 
"That scary study," I said. "You know, the one that proved hormone 
replacement therapy will kill me.'' 
In July 2002, a Women's Health Initiative study of Prempro, an estrogen- 
progestin combination taken by millions of menopausal women, was halted when it 
showed that the medication increased the risk of breast cancer, heart disease, 
stroke and pulmonary embolism. Later results showed that older users of the 
hormone had twice the rate of dementia as others. 
When it hit the headlines, the news scared everybody to death. "Forty- five 
percent of women stopped abruptly," says Risa Kagan, a gynecologist in the East 
Bay who often lectures on women's health. 
Then the news got even worse. Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, which 
comes in various combinations and strengths and is prescribed to women to replace 
the natural sex hormones that wane as they age, did not even improve quality 
of life in such areas as mood, memory, sleep or sex drive. "For the average 
woman there is no effect,'' Jennifer Hays, lead author of the study, said at the 
time. 
Sales of Prempro dropped by half. My HMO sent out a letter warning of the 
dangers of HRT. 
Millions of women went back to their hot flashes and sweaty sheets. It is not 
fun toughing menopause out without hormones, but the choice seemed clear: to 
suffer dull hair now or have just a few tufts clinging to your head after 
chemo. To endure the hot flashes now or wait 10 years and have one or both breasts 
lopped off. To, as my friend Meg Rosenfeld says, be "hot and alive or cool </docText>

Would you like to sit outside on a bitter cold day, with no coat and no 
house, just waiting for someone to come home and take care of you? Would you like 
to be hit? Do you want to go all day without food and water?

Neither does your dog, Monica Shaud, a cruelty investigator for the Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Patricia Barkow's second-grade 
class at the Deerfield Township Elementary School.

"Think of all the things you would not want done to you, the way you would 
want to be treated, and do that for your animal," Shaud told the children as 
Elvis, her shepherd-collie mix, sat quietly in front of the class. "They're just 
like us. They have feelings."

The children were willing listeners, as Shaud and fellow investigator Kelly 
Serbeck told them about their job. Many had seen the "Animal Cops" program on 
Animal Planet, and already had an idea. A good part of their work is educating 
people on how to take care of pets when they see dogs on too-short chains, 
sitting outside with no water or living in a yard full of trash.

The investigators also taught the children how to interact with a strange dog 
(let it sniff you first), signs that a dog isn't friendly (ears pointed back, 
growling, showing teeth) and the importance of spaying and neutering pets 
because there aren't enough good homes for the dogs and cats already born.</docText>

The bearded man wearing neck-to-ankle Carhartts coveralls and an Elburn Coop 
baseball cap rumbles through the small herd of bison from behind the wheel of 
a pickup truck. 
They shuffle away as his truck creaks forward. But they are used to Don 
Hanson and his routines, as used to him as bison can be. After all, he's been like 
a father to the Fermilab herd for 27 years. 
But when Hanson finally retreats to his retirement - "in the next few years" 
- on a 40-acre farm he's been readying in southern Illinois, he won't be 
taking even one along, nor looking to start a new a herd. 
Hanson plans to have dairy cattle and horses. 
The bison will stay at their 80-acre Fermilab pasture for the same reason he 
doesn't feed them by hand - or even identify them beyond the two-digit tags 
stapled to their ears. 
"They're so unpredictable, you don't have the luxury of getting close," 
Hanson said. "I want to be able to walk out there and pat them on the head and say, 
'How are you doing today?'?" 
For sure, Hanson, 56, didn't get into this job because he wanted to be a 
matador. 
The ranching life is a simple one. Sunshine. Cloud cover. Farm feed. Slow 
roaming. Pasture grazing. 
He's comfortable with the high-energy physics sitting a half-mile away in the 
alien-looking, 16-story Wilson Hall, itself inspired by a Gothic cathedral in 
Beauvais, France. 
Over on this side of the lab, Hanson and the bison in his care look perfectly 
at home roaming their stretch of prairie. No microscopic acceleration, no 
creating the future - just living history. 
"I like things a little dull," Hanson said. 
He's managed to find his Dullsville - and his paradise - in the unlikeliest 
of places. 
At first blush, Fermilab seems like an odd place to have bison - the correct 
term for what some called buffalo after French fur traders compared them to 
cattle, or boeuf. 
The first director of the U.S. Department of Energy facility, Robert Wilson, 
wanted to give residents and visitors the opportunity to see Americana with 
their own eyes. That led not only to the bison but also the ambitious 1,000-acre 
prairie restoration program on the 6,800-acre laboratory grounds. </docText>

Below the drumbeat of reassurances from government and the cattle industry
that mad cow disease poses no threat to public health, a small universe of
scientists working on a family of related illnesses are finding disturbing
evidence to the contrary.

Several little-publicized studies, as well as ongoing research at a
government laboratory in Montana, continue to spark questions about human
susceptibility not only to mad cow, but to sister diseases such as chronic
wasting disease that mainly affects deer and elk, and to scrapie, which
infects sheep. 
...
For that matter, some say, it's possible that CWD, endemic in Colorado's
wild deer and elk, has also sickened and proven fatal to humans, but
doctor's haven't - or can't - yet recognize signs of the disease during an
autopsy.

Little of this research, nor the wary comments of researchers toiling in
relative obscurity, reaches a broad public audience, leaving most people
to hear the oft-repeated promises of well-funded interest groups or
high-profile public officials.

Just last week, for example, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association
described mad cow disease solely as an animal and economic problem - not a
human health problem. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and Colorado's
own commissioner of agriculture have made similar pronouncements. 
...
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wasn't initially
interested in the cluster, but since the discovery of the case of mad cow
in Washington state the agency is taking another look at the case,
according to The Inquirer.

CJD may be underreported

Even so, experts caution that clusters can also be coincidences. Rare
diseases don't always end up geographically spread out. 
...
Misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's

If one considers that Alzheimer's disease kills some 50,000 Americans a
year, then the true number of CJD cases is probably more than the
conventional estimate of 200 to 300 cases a year, but more like 500 to
5,000 cases if one considers the range of misdiagnosed Alzheimer's cases. 
...
"Could BSE have been transmitted to people in the U.S. but gone
unrecognized because it looked like (classical) CJD?" Bosque said. "I
suppose it is possible, but there would be no obvious explanation for the
fact that (new variant) CJD has not been seen in the U.S."
...
Bosque, the Denver neurologist, said the ability for TSEs to hide inside
some animals and increase their infectivity is worrisome.

"It raises an additional level of concern, that these prions can persist
in animals, and increase, even though (the animals) don't appear sick,"
Bosque said. "For one thing, it shows you that screening for just
obviously sick animals may not be sufficient."

But currently, the United States focuses its testing almost solely on sick
or "downer" animals. Industry officials have said testing every cow for
mad cow disease as Japan does would be a waste of time and money. </docText>

Please help the animals at the Page County VA shelter not freeze to death.
  
Friends - the piece of crap shelter they have at Page County isn't keeping out the elements.  There is a constant draft from the outside part of the kennels into the inside part.  Further, when the kennels are hosed out, the water runs into the inside part of the kennel.  It's freezing since it's in the single digits in Page.  The dogs were literally hopping around this morning to keep from having to stand on the icy floors.
 
I got a call from Stacy at the shelter this morning.  She was in tears when she told me what was going on.  I've emailed the state vet and the County and if they don't do something tomorrow, we're going to need hundreds of phone calls and emails to both the County office and the state vet's office.  Actually, I know damn well that the County doesn't care.  PLEASE call the County office and ask them what they're doing to keep the animals from freezing to death up there.  Tell them that you've been told that the kennels are iced over.  If they get enough phone calls, they'll take us seriously.  Be polite but firm.  The number is .  It is crucial that you try to do this tomorrow, Monday, 1/12/04.  There is no County Administrator in place, so just leave your message with the Receptionist.  I know how they are up there, and if we don't force them to do something, they won't.
 
In the meantime, please look at Petfinder and let me know if you can take any dogs.

I really like your column! I'm just a little kitten, but I hope that someday 
I'm as smart as you are, and maybe I can help other kitties and their people, 
too. But I wonder....well, maybe it's just because I'm still a baby, but 
sometimes I get confused about who's who. You talk about your dog and your grammie 
and gramma-kitties and your mama and stuff, and I'd just like to get some idea 
of who's what, if you know what I mean. Were you ever kittens? Are you fixed? 
How did you get so smart? Maybe you can put up some pictures of yourselves so 
we can see who's writing the column. I bet you're really cute! *buries nose 
under tail shyly*
Sincerely,
Sin?ad: Buster, thank you so much for your compliments. We love to hear from 
kittens, and we're quite happy to answer your questions and show you some 
pictures. We'll ask Mama to include some photos when she puts our column up online.
Siouxsie: We were indeed kittens once. Tiny little kittens that fit in the 
palm of our Mama's hand. Mama took lots of pictures of us when we were babies, 
but unfortunately, she only scanned one. Still, it will give you an idea of 
what we looked like when we were babies.
Sin?ad: How did we get so smart? Darling, we asked lots of questions and 
learned about everything we could. Mama always reads books about cats and dogs and 
all kinds of things, so we learn a lot from her. After all, we cats are 
telepathic and can read our person's mind.

There once was a pet pig who sang to the moon and, best of all, escaped the
fate of her porcine peers. Piglet's story is Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's
powerful introduction to his exploration of the emotional lives of billions
of pigs, cows, chickens and other animals destined for slaughter and
rendering into meat.

In previous books, the bestselling author (When Elephants Weep, Dogs Never
Lie About Love) has examined the complex natures of animals we hunt,
exploit, abuse and, in the case of dogs and cats, share our lives with. In
his new book, he turns his attention to the most numerous category of 
animal
in the world. Over 40 billion chickens are killed worldwide each year, for
instance. "The suffering of almost all farm animals is unique, particular,
mostly beyond language to describe or explain," Masson writes. "If we give
it no thought, and yet eat them for our meals, are we not morally blind,
ethically dumb, and humanly remiss?"

The Pig Who Sang to the Moon is Masson's offering of intellectual food for
that thought, and his skill at serving it up produces an informative and
compelling narrative. He reveals the depth of the interior lives of farmed
animals, and highlights just how much they suffer from the brutality of
intensive farming and from being deprived of every expression of their 
basic
instincts and sensibilities. "Not what you are eating, but whom you are
eating is the question on my lips," Masson writes.

In discussing each kind of farmed animal, Masson harks back to the feral
ancestors it resembles. He also notes how similar they are to human beings
"in their ability to feel anxious, bored, sad, lonely or deliriously 
happy."
Pigs, whose transplanted heart valves can keep humans alive, are 
intelligent
creatures who wag their tails when happy and may die of terror on their way
to the slaughter they seem to sense is imminent. Their maternal instincts
are so strong that even sows confined to barren concrete stalls paw the
ground as if shaping straw into nests for their piglets.

But farmed pigs, according to Masson, are "fattened to immobility, tails
cut, teeth removed . . . forced to urinate and defecate in their sleeping
space, something no pig would ever do in nature." Some are so heavy that
their feet can barely support them. "The pig's life has been distorted,
perverted, deformed, contorted beyond recognition," he concludes.

So, he believes, has the chicken's life. Chickens are "treated as fast food
on legs, bred to be fried and eaten within seven weeks of emerging from the
egg." They are crammed into wire cages that damage their feet and claws.
They are deprived of all natural light, space to flap their wings and earth
to take the dust baths that clean their feathers.
There is no comfortable way to tell the story of farmed animals, and
Masson's pain permeates every chapter. At the same time, his extensive
research, eloquence and reasoned approach to solutions combine to make this
book toweringly important, and to legitimize Masson's personal mission as
the animals' ambassador to the carnivorous world.

The Animal Protection Institute (API), in conjunction with the Progressive 
Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) will again be working in Olympia to bring 
about passage of House Bill 1151, legislation that would ban the private 
possession of wild and dangerous animals, such as tigers, cougars, lions, 
bears, wolves, alligators and non-human primates. Washington is one of 
sixteen states that currently have no regulations prohibiting private 
ownership of wild exotic animals.  With all the recent news around the 
tragedy of keeping these animals as "pets," it's time to pass this bill in 
Washington!

HB 1151 has been granted a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on 
Friday, January 16, 2004 at 1:30pm in House Hearing Room B in the (John L. 
O'Brien Building).  Please try to attend the hearing!

It's important that we have a strong show of support for HB 1151.  NOW is 
the time to contact your Representatives and let them know that this bill 
needs to pass THIS YEAR!   If our elected officials do not hear from us, 
this important legislation to protect animals will fail.

        <docText>GOING by first impressions, the two women appear to have nothing in common. 
The American is a diplomat's wife, a stately lady who doesn't own a single pair 
of jeans. An interior designer by profession, the Filipina is also a seasoned 
mountain climber and a self-described "extreme person." Yet when Renee Speltz 
and Vivian de Veyra met through a common friend in November 2002, it was as 
if they had known each other all their lives, and then some. 

"If we believed in reincarnation, we would have probably lived years ago in 
the same place," suggests Speltz, better half of United States Ambassador and 
executive director to Asian Development Bank Paul Speltz. "We just clicked," 
says de Veyra who claps her hand for emphasis. "Suddenly the person who 
introduced us said, 'What's happening? You're speaking the same language!'" 

 
That language is dog. Speltz, a dog lover since her youth, was in the market 
for a labrador, which de Veyra breeds (along with rottweilers and beagles). 
Although Speltz would end up acquiring her chocolate lab Tex from someone else, 
the meeting with De Veyra forged a genuine friendship and a life-saving 
organization like no other. 

Called the Philippine Canine Search and Rescue Association, Inc. (PHK9SAR), 
the non-stock, non-profit organization's mission is threefold: to educate 
Filipinos on what dogs can do in the face of calamities; to train volunteers (that 
is, handlers and dogs) to be effective search and rescue teams; and to serve 
Filipinos caught in life-and-death disasters, both natural and man-made.</docText>

Vet Emma Milne, star of the hit TV series 'Vets in Practice', has returned to 
Egypt with the Brooke Hospital for Animals to raise the plight of donkeys 
slaving in the brick kilns of Cairo.
Emma was first made aware of the suffering inflicted upon thousands of 
donkeys when she visited the brick kiln sites with the Brooke last year. A 
subsequent article in the People newspaper raised nearly ?20,000 and has enabled the 
Brooke to purchase a new 'mobile team' (vehicle plus vets) to reach even more 
'brick kiln donkeys'.
Donkeys often work 12-hour days in temperatures as high as 50C pulling heavy 
loads of bricks on carts between the brick making machines and the furnaces. 
Most suffer from heat exhaustion, pressure sores, lameness, malnutrition and 
broken bones. The workers themselves are very poor and work under arduous 
conditions and tend to beat the donkeys to make them work as hard as possible. 
Before Brooke's arrival, the animals had a very short lifespan and many would be 
worked to death. </docText>

"I've been waiting all week for him."
Last week on Saturday night, January 10 ten of Mark Lamb's sheep were killed, 
nine maimed and 17 bitten; quite a destructive night's work for suspected 
wild dogs and an expensive loss for Mr Lamb.
But last Friday Mr Lamb got his man - or rather dog. At 4.30am on his Mole 
View property Mr Lamb trapped one of a number of dogs that have been roaming his 
land and the area. 10 dogs have been sighted in the area in the last two to 
three months.
"The biggest problem is where they live isn't where they kill," Mr Lamb said.
"We need better strategies - aerial baiting is what they used to use - if 
they still used that we wouldn't have this problem, mound baiting is too time 
consuming don't get enough baits out."
It's a sentiment shared by a number of local graziers who like Mr Lamb have 
lost stock to wild dog attacks. In fact, they're so incensed about the problem 
that yesterday morning they set up a protest in front of the National Parks 
and Wildlife Service office in Tenterfield to lobby for the re-introduction of 
aerial baiting in National Parks.</docText>

The Knoxville Zoo's two new tigers are something special. 
It's easy to see how Kali, a 6-year-old bought from the Nashville Zoo, is 
different. Kali's coat is white; she is the zoo's second white tiger. The park's 
other white tiger, Ravi, is 16. 




The zoo's other new tiger wears a common orange coat. But 3-year-old Tevy is 
one of only 37 of her species in U.S. zoos. 
Currently visitors can see Kali in an exhibit near the park's wild dogs and 
cheetah habitats. Kali and her white older relative will not be exhibited 
together. They will alternate time on exhibit starting this spring after Ravi's 
habitat is expanded. 
Tevy is an Indochinese tiger, a smaller species of the endangered big cat. 
She lives in her own exhibit, near the zoo's gibbons. Loaned to Knoxville, she 
arrived from Chaffee Zoo in Fresco, Calif.

        <docText>A funny thing happened even before the polar ice cap
dropped on our doorstep this month:

After more than a decade of giving fur the cold shoulder, young
fashionistas cozied up to it.
...
Fallen from favor are the big-haired, broad-shouldered beaver coats of the
1980s. Faded from the public consciousness are the guerrilla paint attacks
and PETA's "I'd rather go naked than wear fur" ads, which commanded
attention in the early '90s.

Replacing them are everything from discreet shearlings to chubby jackets
in "Monsters Inc." colors. A host of former spokesmodels for People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Claudia
Schiffer) have turned on their heels and strutted in more than one skin since.
...
"No one is (saying), `What about animal rights?' I've never really thought
about it. That whole thing happened when we were younger, when my mom had
a fur and she stopped wearing it," said O'Brien, regional producer for the
Gen Art organization, which promotes young artists, designers and musicians.
...
Regan, a retired North Carolina State University philosophy professor,
says that the formerly potent Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade has
disbanded. Trans-Species Unlimited, which sponsored day-after-Thanksgiving
"Fur-Free Friday" protests starting in 1985 in New York, "ran with that
for 10 or 15 years," he said. "They just kind of got worn out."

Other groups, such as PETA, maintain anti-fur campaigns, but "those
particular organizations whose primary focus was fur have just
disappeared," Regan said. "And no one has stepped in to take up the slack."
...
Regan, a vegan who doesn't wear leather or wool, dislikes some animal
rights tactics. But he believes some progress has been made. The number of
mink ranches has declined from 1,000 in the '80s to about 300, he said.

"You'll find a significant decrease in the body count," he said.</docText>

        <docText>The chair of the Kentucky Animal Control Advisory Board said 
she will push for new state laws to regulate puppy production operations like 
those police shut down in Grant and Harrison counties this month. 
Board chair and Boone County Animal Warden Becky Reiter has worked closely 
with Grant County over the past two weeks to coordinate the seizure of 124 dogs 
from two kennels that police said were unlicensed and operating as puppy 
mills. 
The Grant County Sheriff's Department first began hearing complaints about 
facilities operated by Ken Sunbom and his former wife, Tonya Moukaddem, more 
than two years ago, according to Chief Deputy Chuck Dills. 
But Reiter said the lack of state laws regulating such businesses prevented 
officials from taking action against the pair's operations until very recently, 
when evidence of animal abuse and neglect was uncovered at the kennels. 
"I'd like to see the animal cruelty statutes strengthened more to include 
some regulation of anyone selling puppies to the public. That would have 
eliminated some of this two- to three-year-long process over which we've watched this 
situation develop," Reiter said.

The Public Health Ministry yesterday warned people against eating raw or 
semicooked eggs in any form for fear of contracting diseases that have killed 
almost a million chickens since November. 
Meanwhile, Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan insisted that the 
chicken deaths were not caused by the birdflu virus and that initial tests had 
indicated a chicken butcher in Nakhon Sawan had contracted a bacterial infection, 
and not birdflu, as suggested by a senator from the central province. 
Sudarat said the Cabinet wanted her ministry to protect people from being 
infected by the cholera and bronchitis outbreak by refraining from eating 
semiboiled eggs, fried eggs with raw yokes, or ice cream topped with raw egg yoke. 
She said the Agriculture Ministry had also been ordered to ensure that no 
chicken meat from diseasehit areas was released on the market. 
Sudarat said the Public Health Ministry had been closely monitoring the 
symptoms of the hospitalised chicken butcher from the beginning, but had not made 
any announcement on the case because it was still awaiting final confirmation 
on the cause of his illness. She said results from laboratory tests would be 
released in two or three days, confirming whether he had bird flu or not.</docText>

Volunteers who raise money for the RSPCA have criticised the decision to 
close the charity's dog rehoming centre near Diss. 

They have been told, by the RSPCA's Norwich and Mid-Norfolk branch, that the 
dogs are being moved to another boarding facility, north of the city, for 
financial reasons. 

However, the Diss volunteers claim it would be less costly to continue 
running the facility at the Heywood. 

They are also in dispute with the charity over staffing levels at its Paws 
centre in Norwich, and claim money raised is spent on administration rather than 
animal welfare. 

Carla Crisp, the RSPCA's Diss volunteers co-ordinator, said: "If cost-cutting 
is the main reason for removing the dogs, surely Diss kennels is the better 
and much cheaper option?

"There are no paid staff on the premises, so experienced volunteers carry out 
front of house duties as well as walk, groom and socialise the dogs on a 
daily basis.

"Obviously, this means that monies donated can be spent on dogs and not 
staff."

She said people should think carefully before donating their "hard-earned 
cash", adding that there were many other local charities involved in animal 
welfare, which would welcome a contribution. </docText>

Kennewick businessman and property developer Warren Luke has had to put on 
hold his plans for a Tri-City mini zoo after two dogs attacked and killed most 
of his exotic pets this weekend. 
The two dogs, a German shepherd and a German shepherd mix, were captured and 
are being held at Tri-City Animal Control, said Bruce Young, executive 
director. 
Luke said about 30 of his exotic pets were killed in the attacks, which took 
place early Saturday morning and then again early Monday morning. 
The animals killed in the attacks included different types of pheasants and 
other birds, two llamas and three monkjack deer. Luke said he has had some of 
the animals for several years. 
He estimated the animals were worth about $20,000. 
He said he was traumatized by the loss of the animals, as well as the missed 
opportunity for children to see them, and had not considered yet whether to 
pursue legal action against the dogs' owners. </docText>

This time the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) has its 
sights set on the Home Secretary for breaking the law by "routinely 
underestimating the level of suffering laboratory animals endure in UK testing 
laboratories."
The Judicial Review proceedings against David Blunkett are backed by a number 
of distinguished experts, with much of the evidence taken from secretly taped 
video footage, which the BUAV claims exposes monkey brain research at 
Cambridge University.
The challenge is the second legal case in a fortnight to be brought against 
the Government in connection with the planned Primate Research Facility.
The BUAV says its investigation shows the Government licenses experiments on 
marmosets under only a "moderate" instead of a more appropriate "substantial" 
suffering banding.
According to the group, Mr Blunkett has ignored obvious suffering such as 
water deprivation and distressing training acts. It says the Government's 
position of underestimating lab animal suffering is morally wrong, serves to mislead 
the public and is also against the law.</docText>

The SPCA is to prosecute a member of a Durban North school governing body and 
his teenaged son for the alleged "callous killing" of an Egyptian goose.

The killing, in the school grounds during the holidays, has outraged 
residents.

One resident, Leon Roux, yesterday called on Tony Jordaan, headmaster of 
Northwood Boys' High, to "denounce this act in the strongest possible terms during 
assembly and to emphasise to pupils that wildlife is precious".

He further urged the headmaster to boot the father off the governing body and 
even ban him from entering the school, and to summon the son to his office to 
tell him he could be expelled.

Neither the headmaster nor the father could be contacted for comment 
yesterday.

Letters to local newspapers told how the father allegedly handed a pellet gun 
to a youth - believed to be his son - and instructed him to shoot two geese. 
After missing the first bird, a letter writer said, five shots were fired at 
the second goose.</docText>

More than 1,000 tiger pawprints have been found in a six-day census of the 
Sunderban marshlands of east India, indicating a slight rise in numbers of the 
endangered animal, a forestry official said. 
"More than 1,000 impression of pugmarks (pawprints) have been collected this 
time," Atanu Raha, chief conservator of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve, told 
reporters here late Monday. "This year's census has indicated an encouraging 
trend. We have found some prints of young tigers too. It not only indicates 
stability in the numbers of the big cats, but also indicates that the tiger 
population is on the rise." 
At the last count two years ago, 950 pawprints were screened, with wildlife 
experts concluding that the reserve had about 271 tigers. The Sunderbans is a 
delta region of the mighty Ganga river, spreading across 52 islands near the 
Bay of Bengal off the southern tip of India's West Bengal state and neighbouring 
Bangladesh. Lurking in the thick mangrove forests interwined by 
criss-crossing creeks, the tiger is known to occasionally jump on to boats to pick up human 
beings and then swim through the marshes with its kill. </docText>

Consumers may care more about country of origin labeling (COOL) than you 
would imagine. A new poll by the National Farmers Union (NFU) shows strong support 
for such labels among consumers, backed up with a willingness to pay a little 
more for labeled foods, and an inclination to buy food produced in the US. 
The poll is the centerpiece of a one-day Washington, DC fly-in by NFU taking 
place today. 

This afternoon the Senate will hold a cloture vote on the omnibus 
appropriations bill that includes an amendment delaying implementation of mandatory COOL 
rules until September of 2006. NFU estimates close to 100 farmers, ranchers 
and consumers from across the country will visit Senate offices today, ahead of 
the vote. R-CALF USA will join NFU for the grassroots action.

"Farm and consumer organizations representing more than 50 million Americans 
want the country-of-origin labeling law implemented without delay," says NFU 
president Dave Frederickson.</docText>

SPOMA Dinner nets over $230,000 to Benefit Mistreated 
Animals

It was an exciting Saturday night at the Millennium 
Broadway Hotel.  The Eighth Annual Society for the 
Prevention of Mistreatment of Animals Benefit dinner 
was hosted by Luella Vedric, a long-time advocate for 
animal rights and endangered species conversation.  
Dinner and dessert was provided by Fruit-of-the-Earth 
Vegan Organic Catering for the $1500 per plate dinner.  
Entrees included black bean and veggie enchiladas, 
barley and seitan pilaf, and chana masala with spinach.  
Dessert choices were sweet potato pie, chocolate applesauce 
cake and fruit spring rolls.

Guests included Jessica Alba, Kim Basinger and Jeri Ryan.   
r'Bear, Melissa Ethridge performed following author and 
songwriter Jimmy Buffett, the keynote speaker.  Paul McCartney 
had been slated as speaker, but was unable to attend due 
to schedule conflicts.

In a chilly moment, r'Bear, the well-known rap artist, 
received a cool reception from several of the conservationist 
purists in attendance, who believe r'Bear's exotic animal 
captive-breeding program located in Southern California 
works against the genetic variability necessary for species 
long-term survivability.  Despite r'Bear's $80,000 donation 
to SPOMA, applause was tepid following his performance.

With temperatures averaging about 10 degrees colder than last year, wildlife 
and feral cats are having a tougher time making it through the winter.
The Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons has put out a request for donations of 
doghouses to use as shelters for the local feral cat population. ?With this 
tough winter, it?s been very hard on non-native, as well as native species who 
aren?t used to adapting to this weather,? said Sara Davison, Executive 
Director of ARF. ?Feral cats develop winter coats, and are resourceful, but some 
places have risks associated with them, like cars they may sleep under.? She said 
her group monitors 600 wildcat colonies from Westhampton to Montauk, with its 
Operation Cat program, which provides the cats with food and shelter. ?We 
also urge people to bring their domestic pets inside in this weather, but if they 
use dog houses, they need to use straw or hay, which doesn?t freeze, instead 
of blankets, which get wet and freeze.? She said outdoor dogs and cats also 
need more food in colder weather.</docText>

Even more than the U.K., we in the U.S. have been transformed by cheap and 
plentiful food. To appreciate just how deeply ingrained the urge for 
agricultural innovation is in this country, it merits remembering that the United States 
was born at the peak of the 18th century agricultural revolution, called the 
era of "improvement." Our founding, farming presidents envisioned the nation as 
a place of better cows, better plants, better farming tools. The result: 
bigger cows, bigger plants, bigger yields, bigger farms. 

It worked so well, we ourselves grew bigger. We outgrew our kitchen counters, 
doorways and beds. How could our grandparents have been so short? 

The technology brought a social revolution. In the last 50 years, with the 
advent of postwar fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, intensive livestock 
methods, power feeding formulas, antibiotics and hormones, factory farms have 
replaced traditional methods. When the 20th century began, half the population 
lived on family-owned farms. Now, less than 1% of Americans do.</docText>

A hunter accused by state wildlife officers of poaching a trophy elk last 
fall pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Pitkin County Court.

A jury trial for Marc McKinney of El Jebel was set for May 14 by Judge Erin 
Fernandez Ely.

McKinney?s attorney, Arnie Mordkin, said before the court appearance that 
negotiations with the district attorney?s office weren?t successful. In court, 
Mordkin referred to the case as ?a little more peculiar than usual.?

McKinney was charged by the Colorado Division of Wildlife for allegedly using 
salt and minerals to attract a cow elk to a hunting site on national forest 
east of Aspen. Later that same day, Sept. 11, he shot a trophy bull that 
wandered onto the site, according to the allegations.

The elk were killed during archery season. McKinney?s possession of a hunting 
license isn?t an issue.

After an investigation by wildlife officers, McKinney was ticketed on Oct. 7 
for two counts of illegal possession of wildlife, unlawful taking of wildlife 
and aggravated illegal possession of wildlife.</docText>

Dahlia: Mutts walk the walk 
January 21, 2004 
Plenty of pretty kitties were on hand, but not a catfight was to be found 
during the third annual Mutts and Models fashion extravaganza, held recently at 
the Gothic Theatre.
It's the only fashion show in town where Denver's most fashionable folks 
mingle with the bow-wows - literally - bringing their favorite four-legged friends 
to the benefit for Harrison Memorial Animal Hospital.

   


For this year's fete, aptly titled "Pets in the City," the mutts and the 
models strutted their stuff in front of a New York City skyline backdrop provided 
by Dave Barnes of ScenoGraphics, in fabulous fashions by New York designer 
David Rodriguez, who flew to Denver for the fete.
Rodriguez's clothes have graced countless celebrities, most notably the 
pretty kitties on the hit HBO series Sex and the City.</docText>

The arrow-pierced Canada goose rescued from a Reno lake last Friday has died 
from its injuries, officials said Tuesday.
And a local hunter has come forward to admit that he believes he shot the 
fatal arrow while legally hunting in Lockwood along the Truckee River, but he 
thought he had missed, officials said.
The bird ? with an arrow protruding from its chest ? apparently had flown 
some five miles from Lockwood to the lake in the South Truckee Meadows, where it 
remained for more than a week before its rescue.
The arrow was removed at a Sparks veterinary hospital, but the goose died 
Saturday night, officials said.
?The stress was apparently too much for it,? said Chris Healy, spokesman for 
the Nevada Department of Wildlife. ?It didn?t make it.?</docText>

        <docText>Paris Hilton has joined forces 
with The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in their campaign effort to 
end the infamous Canadian seal hunt, said HSUS. 
Paris was spotted wearing a hooded sweatshirt reading "Club Sandwiches, Not 
Seals" at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. She also urged her 
boyfriend, Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter, to write a letter with her to the 
Canadian Embassy demanding Canada end the hunt. They put their finished letters into 
plastic air sick bags written with the phrase "What's Going on in Canada Will 
Make You Sick." Paris said she is sympathetic to the seal campaign and even 
bought Nick a plush seal toy as a gift when they first met, according to the

What is it in the makeup of cats that allows them to take great pleasure in 
teasing, taunting and otherwise just making life miserable and fun at the same 
time for the people who feed them?
I have a blond American shorthair named Maggie. My wife picked out the name, 
not me. I don't believe in giving animals people names, unless it's 
outrageous. Anyway, I retired young and am now a house-husband. So when I do the wash 
and am folding the warm clothes, Maggie plops down on the cleanest, warmest 
article of clothing most likely to show cat hair.
When I read the paper, she will get on the table and plop on the paper right 
where I'm reading. How does she know where I'm reading? I'll try to put the 
paper on the table and read out of the corner of my eye, but it just doesn't 
work.
At 3 a.m. she will sit on my chest and circle my head just to wake me up. She 
will get in my favorite chair about three minutes before I sit in it, and 
then look most indignant when I kick her off, gently, of course. Doesn't she know 
that I make about 20 of her and am much stronger?
Just what is it in the makeup of these wonderful, mysterious creatures that 
they behave like that?
They make me think that they are just human women in fur coats. (Actually I 
love it and would be hurt if she were to stop.) Like they say, "Dogs have 
masters, Cats have house staff." I do believe that to be true.</docText>

As far as anyone can tell, the biggest threat from the world's first 
transgenic pet might be that it keeps a few goldfish awake at night. 
But for opponents of transforming animals through bioengineering, the red 
glow emanating from the new GloFish might as well be a five-alarm fire. 
Because the US government quickly agreed the fish was safe, concern is 
spreading that regulatory oversight of transgenic animals may be flawed.
A long line of genetically modified animals are under study: flea-resistant 
dogs, cats with nonallergenic fur, and designer mosquitoes that could outbreed 
the current pests but would be incapable of carrying diseases such as malaria. 
Thus, the tiny and innocuous GloFish has plunged the scientific and 
regulatory communities into murky waters.

By Mayo Clinic staff Are you considering a vegetarian diet but not sure where 
to begin? Adopting a plant-based diet may be as easy as making a few 
substitutions. Before you know it, tofu dogs, black bean burgers and sausage made from 
textured vegetable protein may replace old favorites such as hot dogs, 
hamburgers, roast beef and bacon.
Some people choose a vegetarian diet for religious, ethical or environmental 
reasons. Others switch to a plant-based diet for health reasons. A vegetarian 
diet generally contains less total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol and 
includes more dietary fiber. And vegetarians have lower rates of some cancers, 
cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
Adopting a healthy vegetarian diet isn't as simple as scraping meat off your 
plate and eating what's left. Find out what you need to know about a 
plant-based diet and how you can meet your daily nutritional needs.

More and more, people are willing to do just about anything to take their 
pets on family trips, no matter how far. And hotels, eager to cash in on a market 
they once disdained, are responding with packages and amenities designed to 
attract pet owners.

"There's an incredible demand for it," said Steve Pinetti, senior vice 
president of sales and marketing for San Francisco-based Kimpton Boutique Hotels. 
"The emotional connection that one has with one's pets is akin to having 
children. I would be willing to bet that in some cases the connection is even 
greater."

Hotels and resorts are jumping in, and there are even travel agents who deal 
solely in pet travel. One airline will allow pets to travel in the main cabin 
with their owners when it begins flying this year.

A poll taken by the Travel Industry Association in 2001 showed that about 29 
million Americans traveled with their pets in the previous three years. In a 
recent study commissioned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, 76 percent of dog 
owners said they would be more loyal to a hotel chain that accepted dogs, even if 
they weren't traveling with their dog. Those numbers have translated to a 
greater acceptance of dogs (and cats) than a decade ago, when most front-desk 
clerks were likely to turn up their noses at the mere suggestion of a pet 
spending the night.</docText>

However, the FDA has acknowledged that it will explore animal-welfare issues. 
Research has shown that the cloning process severely affects the genetic 
makeup of animals and can cause clones to suffer. The Humane Society of the United 
States, for one, is deeply concerned about the ethical implications of 
cloning.
"Deaths and deformities in cloned animals are the norm, not the exception, 
and these studies make plain once again that these creatures are suffering 
terribly in the process," says Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of HSUS. "There 
is no societal value to this. This is just science run amok in the service of 
the further industrialization of agriculture."
The main method of cloning involves taking the nucleus from a cell of the 
animal to be cloned and placing it in an egg that has had its nucleus removed. A 
University of Missouri study on cloned pigs, according to HSUS, reported that 
"out of 10 born, 5 died or were destroyed by researchers due to defects such 
as heart failure, lameness, and anemia."
Jorge Piedrahita and researchers at North Carolina State University's College 
of Veterinary Medicine announced last month that they had cloned two Duroc 
pigs. "Certain genes were dis-regulated or damaged," Mr. Piedrahita reported.

Every pet cat, dog and ferret in Cook County would have to be implanted with 
an identifying microchip under a proposal discussed Wednesday by a Cook County 
Board panel. 
The proposed ordinance, sponsored by Commissioner Peter Silvestri of Elmwood 
Park, would mean that some 3 million pets would have to have the implants. 
Other pets, like birds and reptiles, would not be covered by the law. 
Owners who did not comply would face fines of $20 per day, but it's doubtful 
that the county is in any position to enforce the ordinance, considering one 
study showed only a 25 percent compliance rate with the county's existing 
ordinance requiring rabies vaccinations. 
The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice, can be implanted with a 
syringe into the folds of skin on a pet's neck scruff and allows lost pets to 
be readily identified and reunited with their owners, said Dan Parmer, 
administrator of the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control.</docText>

Nineteen horses, nearly all of them unkempt, hungry and wild-eyed, were taken 
from a farm north of West Salem on Wednesday, three days after authorities 
found a stallion dead in a muddy corral.

Four llamas also were taken away.

Two women living at the farm, LeeAnn Lucas, 46, and Gail Solberg, 45, were 
cited on one count of second-degree animal neglect, a misdemeanor, said Sgt. 
Eric Shepherd of the Polk County Sheriff?s Office.

Lucas and Solberg could face more charges after a veterinarian examines the 
animals today, Shepherd said. The women are scheduled to appear in court Feb. 
12.

If found guilty, they would be forced to give up the animals. Meanwhile, 
authorities hope to place the animals in foster homes.

Shortly after 11 a.m., a caravan of vehicles, including a handful of trucks 
pulling horse trailers, stopped in the fog in front of the farmhouse on Oak 
Knoll Road NW where Lucas and Solberg live. Deputies served a search warrant at 
the house.</docText>

"We will chain you and beat you until the tears come no more. We will destroy 
your will, and we will torture you all the way down to the core of your soul. 
Do not fight us. You will never win. You belong to us, and you will obey us. 
You work for us now."

A dog imprisoned on a chain, unable to lie down, stuck outside in the cold, 
placed in solitary confinement without the love and humane care he needs. What 
did he do wrong? Why is he being punished? The dog did nothing wrong. It is 
just the victim of a person who doesn't know, understand or care about what a 
dog needs. And the dog certainly does not understand why he was jailed, in the 
worst way, for doing absolutely nothing. 

My name is Timber, and once I was placed on a chain, where I stayed for 
months. The woman next door tried repeatedly to get my owner to take me for a walk, 
play with me, or even just give me a name. My name was the black and white 
dog. When the neighbor asked my owner why I was on a chain, he replied, "Since 
he is digging up the grass, I decided to chain him up." She then explained some 
of the reasons dogs dig: loneliness, boredom, not enough exercise, no toys to 
play with, no daily walks, etc., and gave him some literature about what dogs 
need from human companions. </docText>

 Pet expert Charlotte Reed makes recommendations on how to take great care of 
your pet and get the most out of having a pet.
New York, New York (PRWEB) January 22, 2004 ?As you implement your own 
lifestyle changes for the new year, think about what your pet might vow if it had 
the chance. A constant supply of mice to chase? All-you-can-eat bacon and bones 
buffets? Animals? resolutions may best be left to you, but by considering 
their health and well-being, you?ll ensure you all end up happy by this time next 
year.
    Vet time: Start your pet?s year on the right paw with a comprehensive 
check-up at the vet?s office. A regular examination provides a valuable benchmark 
for your pet?s health and can help prevent a host of ills. Dogs should be 
checked twice a year (especially in the spring to banish fleas and heartworm) 
while cats can get by on just one annual visit. Pets over seven years old need 
more attention and should be seen by a vet two to three times a year.

The discovery of Mad Cow disease on a Washington farm has touched off a
firestorm about U.S. regulations to prevent this deadly disease. But Mad
Cow represents much deeper perils of a global industrial food system,
accelerated by recent trade agreements. It is Mad Cow making the headlines
today, but in the last year it has also been e coli, salmonella,
antibiotic resistance, foot and mouth disease, and obesity. The question
is whether we are going to address each crisis as it comes along in a
patchwork of regulations, or re-think our food and farming system?
...
Amid the roar of the industrial food system is a movement driven primarily
by consumers to re-connect with our food producers. Farmers markets have
grown nearly 80 percent over the last ten years. State-labeled food
products, such as ?Minnesota-Grown,? are seen more and more on supermarket
shelves. In November, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and
the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE) launched a
simple Web site to help consumers find local farmers who produce
sustainable meat and poultry. To our surprise, the site
(www.eatwellguide.org) got over 8 million hits in the first month.
Hopefully, the discovery of Mad Cow disease in the United States ? the
product of an industrial, global food system ? will spawn a new discussion
about what kind of food system is best for farmers, consumers and our
rural communities. It?s about more than just one cow.</docText>

Veterinarian says poultry producers and authorities agreed to keep bird-flu 
diagnosis quiet for fear of hurting exports 
The outbreak of avian flu is a result of a miscalculation by the government, 
which decided to cover up the poultry-disease epidemic when it was first 
detected last year, a veterinarian said. 
Though not involved in the decision-making process, the source, a reliable 
veterinarian who asked not to be named, said the government?s initial good 
intentions have become a nightmare for the country. 
He told The Nation that the National Institute of Animal Health under the 
Department of Livestock Development found last year that the mass deaths of 
poultry occurring at that time were caused by bird flu, not cholera and bronchitis 
as the government has tried to claim. 
However, after discussions among related agencies ? farm operators, the 
department and government officials ? agreement was reached that in the interests 
of chicken exports, which are worth about Bt70 billion a year, the true cause 
should not be disclosed. 
?At that time they reached a deal that all chicken in affected areas must be 
killed to control the disease while the government would compensate the 
farmers,? said the source, who works closely with the Livestock Department.</docText>

What Do You Do When A
A 100-pound mountain lion can kill an 800-pound elk. Keep that in mind the 
next time you go hiking in cougar territory. 
If you are alone and unarmed, and one of these powerful predators attacks you 
-- intent on killing and eating you, rather than merely trying to drive you 
away from its offspring or a previous kill -- the contest likely will be as 
lopsided as if you had waded into traffic to wrestle a pickup truck. Worse, 
actually, because the odds are that you will never even know until the cougar bites 
into the back of your neck. 
Whether such prowess leaves you horrified or reverent depends on your 
attitudes regarding the role of wildlife and nature in a human-dominated world. 
Mountain lions are among the few remaining species on the planet that persist 
in occasionally regarding humans as food -- grizzly bears, sharks, lions, 
tigers and crocodiles pretty much fill out the roster -- and like all big 
predators they test our philosophical boundaries in a way that most creatures do not. </docText>

The seizure of allegedly abused dogs from two Northern Kentucky kennels this 
month has hit a lot of people close to home. This week, the lead investigator 
in the case found out he was one of them. 
Grant County Chief Deputy Chuck Dills said Monday his sister discovered her 
two missing Shih Tzus are among the 108 dogs seized from Tonya Moukaddem 
Sunbom's Harrison County property a week ago. 
Grant County Animal Warden Wanda Bedard said the two are among eight dogs 
that will be released to their owners today. 
Before this week, Dills' sister, Karen Beaver, last saw her dogs two years 
ago. Beaver lives about five miles from the kennel Sunbom operated in Pendleton 
County. Dills said that three days after Sunbom stopped by his sister's home 
to ask if Beaver would sell or breed her Shih Tzu, the American Kennel 
Club-registered dog valued at $500 disappeared from the family's yard. Six months 
later, Beaver's second Shih Tzu also vanished. </docText>

        <docText>A mountain lion has been spotted twice this month by residents in a 
new townhouse development in west Dublin, prompting park and sheriff's 
officials to distribute fliers warning residents in the area. 
The latest sighting was reported Monday to animal control officers by 
residents near Brigadoon Way and McPeak Lane. A lion was first reported Jan. 11 in 
the same area. 
Since then, animal control officers have been called out to collect the 
carcasses of three does in the area, including one on Wednesday. However, all were 
determined to have died of natural causes, said Tony Owens of the Alameda 
County Sheriff's Animal Control Office. 
This is the first mountain lion spotting in west Dublin since the area has 
been developed, said Steve Bobzien, ecological services coordinator for the East 
Bay Regional Park District. 
He said mountain lions also have been spotted this month in Robert Sibley 
Preserve in the Oakland Hills, and in Anthony Chabot Park in Castro Valley. </docText>

Students in the health sciences programme have something tasty to offer. 
Their cookbook, cleverly entitled Eat Your Heart Out, contains over two hundred 
recipes, with more than 40 being vegetarian or vegan friendly. 

Their book not only aims to benefit the stomachs of McMaster University's 
students and other community members, but all the profits are to be donated to 
the Victorian Order of Nurses Meals on Wheels. Janet Malowany, a fourth-year 
BHSc student, originally initiated the idea of producing a cookbook specifically 
intended for students. 

"Originally, I just wanted a forum for students to be able to share their 
favourite recipes with each other," said Malowany. "Only a few years ago, I was a 
novice in the kitchen, myself. When I moved away from home to off-campus, I 
vowed not to eat TV dinners or too much macaroni and cheese. Thus, I appreciate 
simple and nutritious meals and wanted to share my favourite recipes and try 
out some new favourites." 

Positive responses from fellow students prompted Malowany and other Health 
Science scholars to publish the recipes. Supported by co-organizers Noranda 
Nyholt, Tara Davies, Jo-Lynn Dickson and Matt Dang, the entirely student-driven 
group created the charity cookbook. </docText>

Through the Energy for Wildlife program, the NWTF staff will work directly 
with AGL Resources to integrate wildlife management activities, especially for 
wild turkey habitat, into the company's land oversight programs. Through its 
subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light Company, AGL Resources has approximately 1,500 
miles of natural gas pipeline in Georgia. 
"This partnership with the NTWF is part of our mandate to be a good steward 
of the environment," said Lindsay Thomas, senior vice president of governmental 
affairs and an avid outdoorsman. "This allows us to encourage the growth of a 
fascinating native American bird, the wild turkey. And by encouraging turkey 
habitat, we will be providing habitat and food source for species of both game 
and non-game wildlife such as our native song birds." 
In the early 1930s, wild turkeys were on the verge of extinction, but thanks 
to wildlife agencies and conservation programs such as the NWTF's Energy for 
Wildlife, the birds have made a dramatic comeback. The NWTF estimates that the 
population has grown from only about 30,000 turkeys 70 years ago to more than 
6 million today. 
According to the NWTF, a varied habitat of both open and covered area is ess
ential for wild turkey survival. Wild turkeys prefer open areas for feeding and 
mating, a requirement met by land along pipelines and power lines. The wily 
birds use forested areas nearby as cover from predators and as roosts at night. </docText>

A federal government truck was rammed in a roadblock and a fisheries officer 
aimed his gun at a man's head during a recent undercover probe of abalone 
poachers.
The incident ended with the arrest of two men suspected of poaching nearly 
450 threatened abalone in waters off Sooke. Worries about dangerously low stocks 
prompted the federal Fisheries Department to ban all commercial and 
recreational catching of northern abalone in 1990. Stocks have not recovered since 
then, and experts say poaching is partly to blame.

 Appaled by the laxity of the authorities in seizing banned ivory items from 
traders in Delhi, the Delhi High Court today gave a time limit of eight weeks 
to the Chief Wildlife Warden to seize these items. 
There are about 183 ivory traders in the Capital and till date, the Delhi 
government has seized articles from only 44 such traders. 

Wildlife Protection Society, through its counsel Raj Panjwani, argued that 
though ivory trade was banned in 1991, till date the authorities have done 
little to seize the banned items. 
Justice Manmohan Sarin, in an earlier hearing, had described the attitude of 
the authorities as ??a classic case of passing the buck??. 
The Chief Wildlife Warden, in his reply to the court, had first cited lack of 
space in its godowns. It also added that there were problems relating to 
providing security at the godowns. In 2002, on court orders, a godown was made 
available at Kamla Nehru Ridge, along with additional security. 
The authorities then said that they were still facing problems of lack of 
space. Undeterred by these pleas, the court today directed that all ivory items 
be seized from traders within eight weeks. </docText>

 An Orchard Street man was charged Jan. 13 with animal cruelty after 
allegedly leaving his dog outside in sub-zero temperatures.

Jose A. Burgos, 43, of 34 Orchard St., received a misdemeanor summons for the 
alleged mistreatment of the dog.

Officers went to Orchard Street on a complaint of a dog chained outside the 
house.

Police said the officers observed that the dog ? a white boxer named Scooby ? 
had bones showing through his skin, open sores and was very dirty. 

Police spoke to neighbors who confirmed that the dog was always outside, even 
in frigid weather, with very little shelter, according to reports.

Animal Control arrived at the scene, and the dog was brought to a shelter. 

A NORWALK man was charged Jan. 17 with interfering with police after 
allegedly yelling at officers when he was pulled over on a motor vehicle stop.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals won a battle against the 
owners of a Ben Wheeler puppy mill Wednesday when a Van Zandt County judge 
ruled they were guilty of animal cruelty and must relinquish the dogs to the 
animal rights group. 
Precinct 4 Justice of the Peace Tracey Garner, who presided over the hearing 
to determine custody of the dogs, ruled the mill operators will have to give 
the remaining 30 to 40 canines on their property to the SPCA, which seized 110 
of them Jan 16. 
All the dogs will remain with the SPCA in Dallas and McKinney until they are 
put up for adoption. 
The judge also ordered mill operators to pay the SPCA $6,480 as reimbursement 
for the money it has cost the organization to provide proper care for the 
dogs - $10 a day for each animal for six days.</docText>

We've found the perfect ailment for the age of George W. Bush: bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy, better known as Mad Cow Disease. 
The actual number of humans who suffer from the human variant of Mad Cow 
Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, is, as of now, statistically small, but you would not 
know that from the media's fascinated fixation on it as a vehicle of hysteria 
(read: ratings boost, distraction from dead Americans in Iraq). 
Thus I ask readers to think of Mad Cow Disease as a metaphor for the Bush 
era. Consider the following: the brain of Mad Cow victims is turned into mush, 
rendering them incapable of even eating a pretzel without coming to harm. The 
incubation period for the disease in humans can be as long as 30 years; thus, we 
won't know the extent of the damage that has been that has been done until 
far into the future. The cause of the disease getting into the food supply is 
lax enforcement of an agency due to pressure from corporations that donate money 
in order to thwart regulations. And -- the real Bush signature -- the current 
crisis was avoidable had public health been a priority and voices of experts 
including a Nobel Prize winner (Stanley Pruisner) six months ago, been heeded</docText>

        <docText>A broad array of U.S. environmental and health advocates have 
deplored President George W. Bush's failure to even mention a series of 
critical global issues in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. 
In a flurry of statements issued Wednesday, groups ranging from the League of 
Conservation Voters (LCV) to Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) expressed 
concern that Bush's omissions signaled the loss of interest in environmental 
degradation and the global AIDS crisis. 
Green groups suggested that Bush's failure to even mention the 
environment--despite new reports released by high-level U.S. scientific groups over the past 
year expressing increasing certainty that the burning of oil and other fossil 
fuels is responsible for global warming--was a deliberate attempt to take the 
issue off the political agenda in the November elections. 
"The fact that President Bush avoided mentioning his administration's 
environmental policies could be seen as a tacit admission that his record is 
deplorable and the issue is a vulnerable one for him," according to a statement issued 
by the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) here. 
It noted that Bush had nothing to say about policies he had previously 
trumpeted as major advances for the environment, including his "Healthy Forests" 
initiative, which allows loggers to cut down large, fire-resistant trees in 
remote areas, or his "Clear Skies" initiative which, if approved by Congress would 
allow power plants to defer improvements designed to reduce air pollution for 
a longer period than under current law. Both initiatives have been strongly 
opposed by environmental groups. </docText>

        <docText>The freezing temperatures that have lingered over the area 
for the past couple of weeks have been rough, but those who can?t speak their 
mind about the cold could be in the worst danger. Animals, both wildlife and 
pets, have to rely on humans and their own fur coats to carry them through to 
spring. 
Kim Klippel, operations manager at the Ozaukee County Humane Society, said 
that frostbite is probably the biggest danger to animals, especially on paws and 
ears. She said the risk of contacting frostbite can be reduced by limiting a 
pet?s time outdoors to 10 or 15 minutes.
"Hopefully a lot of people will take care so that we don?t see a whole lot of 
animals being surrendered that have those issues, but some people do need to 
be made aware of it," said Klippel.
Other than frostbite, pet owners should be cognizant of an animal?s body 
temperature. The normal body temperature for both cats and dogs ranges between 
100.5 and 102.5 degrees.
Boots do work
One of the joys of owning a dog is having company on walks, but Klippel said 
if an animal is picking its feet up off of the ground while walking, they 
could be cold and hurting.</docText>

Within the past decade, whole species of marine life have been depleted to 
the edge of extinction. Pollutants from oil to plutonium foul the deep blue 
seas. Many of the billion or so people whose life depends on the bounty of the sea 
face severe privation. This human assault upon the sea, devastating though it 
may be, goes largely unnoticed. With the exception of the occasional 
oil-covered shore bird or plastic debris at the tide line, the injuries lie hidden. 
"You can see a forest fire, but you can't see a damaged reef," says Rilli Hawari 
Diohani, an Indonesian marine biologist who is assistant director of the U.S. 
based Nature Conservancy. Visible or not, the damage is there, it is 
increasing, and in many cases it may be beyond control or recovery. Noticeably, as 
much as 10 percent of the world's coral reefs have been wiped out, largely by 
pollution and destructive fishing methods. At the present rate of devastation, 
another 60 percent will be destroyed in 20 to 40 years. 
Of the world's 15 major ocean fisheries, 13 are being exploited at a rate 
that challenges their ability to sustain fish populations. World food experts 
predict steadily declining catches in the coming years. 
"Dead zones" cause similar havoc. Reports have it that huge chunks of reef in 
western New Guinea and off Zambales in the Philippines have been blown apart 
by dynamite charges used to kill targeted fish (along with young fingerlings, 
plankton, larva, eggs and the reef itself). Traditional fishermen say the 
practice has brought an eerie stillness to waters that once teemed with sea life. 
"In the past, flying fish jumped over the prow of fishing boats heading out to 
sea," say Jun Filoteo, a deep-sea fisherman from Zambales. "Now there is no 
longer such a spectacle. Aside from the motion of the waves, the sea appears so 
calm that it is almost scary."</docText>

While surrounding communities are grappling with a growing stray-pet 
population, the animal welfare group that runs the Princeton-area animal shelter has 
its own plans to deal with the problem. 
Faced with a growing number of unwanted pets and an expanded need for its 
services, the Princeton group called SAVE has embarked on a $5 million 
fund-raising campaign to build a new state-of-the-art facility. 
The building would be nearly eight times larger than the existing shelter at 
Herrontown and Mount Lucas roads in the township - growing from slightly more 
than 4,000 square feet to about 32,000 square feet. 
"There is no reason to think the (human) population is not going to keep 
growing, and that means more pets," said Sara M. Nicolls, SAVE's executive 
director. 
"It's abundantly clear to our board that we have not been keeping up. Our new 
facilities will serve the community now and 20 and 30 years down the road." 
SAVE, an acronym for Small Animal Veterinarian Endowment, expects to take its 
site development plan for a $3.5 million structure to the township planning 
board for review in April, Nicolls said. 
"We are truly out of room," she said. "To do our work as it should be done we 
need to add many components for a user-friendly environment. We have an 
obligation to step up and do it according to up-to-date standards."

In the wake of the discovery of BSE, the United States Department of 
Agriculture has been told to speed up the implementation of a national animal 
identification scheme.

US Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman has told Congress that developing a 
verifiable system, to trace animals from paddock to plate, is a top priority.

While welcoming the scheme, Kendal Frazier from the National Cattlemans Beef 
Association in the US, says there are questions about the cost of 
implementation.

"We have a hundred million head of cattle in the United States; in the life 
of an animal in the United States they change ownership three or four times. We 
have 800,000 producers or premises where cattle are raised. So it's a very 
complicated picture, and we have some questions about it; but we support the 
general concept of it." 

And it appears Australia may have to follow the US lead, and fully implement 
a national ID scheme.

Manager of Australia's NLIS Mick Prendergast says the US beef industry will 
have to accept individual animal identification, after disputing the move for 
decades.

And Mr Prendergast says in order for Australia to continue exporting beef to 
the US, stringent new rules will have to be met. </docText>

Woody Allen once remarked that he didn't want to achieve immortality through 
his work - he wanted to achieve it by not dying. Stephen Valentine could 
possibly do both. A self-professed visionary architect, Valentine has designed what 
could be the project of his career, and its purpose is to conquer death. 
Officially, the building is "the world's first comprehensive facility devoted 
to life extension research and cryopreservation", a six-acre structure that 
will house research laboratories, animal and plant DNA, and up to 10,000 
temporarily dead people. They will have paid to have their bodies (or perhaps just 
their heads) stored there until somebody works out a way to revive them. If 
Valentine is right, they won't have to wait too long. "This is going to be the 
century of immortality," he says. "Children being born today are probably going 
to live an average lifespan of 120 years. Their children, it is being 
predicted, will never die. There will be a time when people won't be able to 
comprehend the thought of not existing any more and just becoming fertiliser." </docText>

Acts of terrorism can do more than just physical damage, and that concerns 
the agriculture industry, according to speakers at the Texas High Plains Grain 
Elevator workshop. 
The workshop, Thursday at the Amarillo Civic Center, featured Tim Reid with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Amarillo. 
Reid said that since Sept. 11, 2001, many aspects of agriculture are looked 
at for security reasons, including crop-dusting planes, feedlot security and 
the transportation industry. 
It would take an immense amount of chemicals, more than most anyone could get 
their hands on at one time, to contaminate many crops or even the water 
system, he said. 
But Amarillo is no stranger to potential terrorists. Reid said an individual 
from Jordan was living in Amarillo prior to Sept. 11, and was reported as 
inquiring about crop dusters after Sept. 11. He was a medical doctor, had not been 
working for three years, but received substantial amounts of money in his 
bank account. 
The individual denied the crop-dusting conversations ever took place, but 
during the 12-hour questioning, he was deceptive in his answers, Reid said. 
Some cells may not be asked to do a terrorist act, but they may be asked to 
get information. For example, one individual in Amarillo was tasked only to 
take pictures of Pantex, Reid said. 
Reid said people may get complacent with the color alert going up around 
holidays and big events, but it's important to be ready for whatever may happen. 
"We better hope we don't get into the norm and people ignore the alerts," 
Reid said. 
Reid said the FBI deals with international terrorists but also domestic 
terrorists when it comes to the agriculture industry. 
"Those people are living here. They may be working for you," he said.</docText>

        <docText>At the eastern edge of the Bitterroot Mountains, a
craggy range of peaks that defines the border between Idaho and Montana,
is a lab full of skeptics who don't hold with the majority scientific
consensus on mad cow disease.

They are world-class researchers on these kinds of diseases, categorically
called "transmissible spongiform encephalopathies" -- or TSEs.

Some of these diseases have been recognized for a long time, but they
captured wide public attention only when it appeared -- first in Britain
-- that the disease could get passed on to people who eat beef from a cow
with this type of brain infection, which eats holes in the brain.

Americans were reminded of this risk recently after the nation's first
known case of mad cow disease (technically bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE) was identified just before Christmas in Eastern
Washington.

Most of the scientists here at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a branch
of the National Institutes of Health, accept that this kind of
"cross-species" transfer of a TSE can, on rare occasions, take place. They
were some of the first to show it, in fact, in experimental animals.

But try to make any other simple statement of fact about mad cow or
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, and you will encounter a stubborn refusal
to let you move even one step beyond the evidence. 
...
Whether it's a prion that's transmitting the infection, Race said, or some
other unrecognized virus is still unknown. The confusing terminology in
this field fraught with uncertainty, he said, is enough to drive even many
scientists nuts.</docText>

The temperature outside was only a whisker above zero Thursday morning, but 
Kadoodle and Pumpkin were toasty warm, sunning themselves in the window of the 
cat section at the Ark, a municipal animal shelter in Forest Park.

The blissful scene belied the cold reality faced by the cats and the rest of 
the 1,100 animals brought annually to the shelter by police, animal-control 
officers and citizens in the seven municipalities and one township it serves. On 
March 31, the Ark will lock its doors, a victim of insufficient financing and 
of its location on a piece of prime real estate on Forest Park's commercial 
and entertainment strip.

A vacant auto body shop in Forest Park is a possible new home for the Ark, 
but the shelter doesn't have $800,000 to buy and renovate the building, said 
Elliott Serrano, shelter manager.

Meanwhile, staff and volunteers are scrambling to find temporary quarters for 
200 or so animals, said Ellen Milad, coordinator of volunteers. Chances are 
good that all will get at least temporary placement in other shelters or in 
private "foster homes," but the long-term prospects are dim for the area's 
unwanted animals, she said.

"The number of stray dogs and cats always seems to increase in March," she 
said. "What will happen to the animals that would have been brought to the Ark 
if we were still here?"</docText>

There's nothing better than coming home in the afternoons for Mary Marshall 
Van Sant.

"I pull in the driveway, and my dogs are so glad to see me they're doing a 
body wag," she said.

Van Sant, who has been a pet owner all of her life, has three dogs and one 
cat on her Colbert County property. If a complaint is issued about barking or 
smell, however, Van Sant could be forced to give one of those animals up to be 
in compliance with an ordinance that prohibits more than three dogs and/or cats 
on the premises.

Sheffield and Tuscumbia already have this ordinance on the books, and Muscle 
Shoals will vote on adopting it at the Feb. 2 council meeting.
Councilman Allen Noles said adopting the ordinance "will put us in line with 
the other municipalities, so animal control can enforce the same (law). It 
will make it easier for them."

Colbert County Animal Control Director Tommy Morson says the ordinance has 
proved helpful in dealing with cases of hoarding, when individuals may have 20 
to 50 animals in their care.

In 2003, animal control received two reported cases of hoarding.</docText>

Scientists in Australia have warned that fish piracy is damaging the Southern 
Ocean to such an extent that time is running out to save it. Illegal 
fishermen, primarily on the hunt for the prized Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus 
eleginoides), are wiping out both fish stocks and bird species that live in the 
ocean. 
Species numbers are said to have dropped so acutely that Australia has called 
for global help to tackle the pirates. 
"It is probably the last chance for us to get it right," Dr Adel Pile, of 
Sydney University, told BBC World Service's One Planet programme. 
"The Southern ocean, this continuous mass of water, is really important, and 
[is] regulating globally things like our climate - El Nino starts in the 
Southern Ocean. 
"If we mess around with the ecosystem enough that we can throw it out of 
balance, it's not just going to be limited to those of us who live in the Southern 
Hemisphere - it's going to have global ramifications." 
Intergovernmental support 
Scientists say they know more about the surface of Mars than they do about 
the Southern Ocean. 
Australia recently deployed an armed surveillance ship to protect fish 
stocks, but campaigners already fear the Patagonian toothfish has been hunted to 
near extinction. </docText>

Builders for Medallion Homes construct a house in a Bexar County subdivision 
that's designed to blend with the natural habitat. 


Builders spared the greenbelt area next to this home built by Medallion 
Homes. The house was designed to be compatible with the nearby woods. 

"I liked the fact that they had gently placed a house so as not to disturb 
anything in the surrounding area," Green said. 
Finesilver Ranch is not a certified Urban Wildlife Program conservation 
development, Green said, but it could easily qualify. 
Certified urban wildlife yards either retain or put back native plants, 
mainly small fruit-bearing trees and shrubs such as persimmons and agaritas. Three 
criteria ? shelter, food and water ? make the yard a certifiable habitat. 
"It was intended for homeowners," Green said. "But then other entities sought 
to get involved ? businesses, school districts, and in this case a builder."</docText>

You know, all the recent news about mad cow disease has made me hungry.
And, apparently, I'm not the only one.

But I'm hungry for a big, juicy T-bone and a baked potato, not a cow brain
sandwich.

Even though the cows have begun to go mad here in the United States,
people refuse to give up their cow brain sandwiches.

That's right. Take Evansville, Ind., for instance, where noggin noshin' is
a tradition.
...
But, it's not just in Indiana. No.

In Stockton, Calif., cow brains are commonly sold as - oh . . . my . . .
gawd - taco filling and sold from the back end of some of the finest
pickup truck restaurants on the West Coast.
...
In Kentucky, eating squirrel brains served with fried eggs was once
considered a rural delicacy. Its popularity declined, however, after
researchers in 1997 found a possible link between eating squirrel brains
and contracting mad cow disease. Plus, ya gotta kill a heck of a lot of
squirrels before you have enough brains to add to that favorite Squirrel
Helper recipe.
...
Considering that mad cow disease - or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy-ex-pee-ala-docious - eats holes in your brain and is
incurable and fatal, you'd think that would be a really big turnoff. But
we Americans consider ourselves to be indestructible. In fact, we cannot
be killed and are immortal. And really, really stupid.

Those who do the whole deep-frying thing think they're safe. They figure
deep-frying will kill any bits of crazy cow on their Medulla Oblongata de
Cristo sandwich.

Well, bad news, Sparky. Cow brains have to be cooked to about 1,200
degrees to kill the rogue proteins called prions that cause the disease.
...
"Just say `no' to brains."</docText>

Despite stringent laws to protect the population of Tigers, an endangered 
species nearing extinction, not a single poacher has been convicted mainly 
because of ignorance and lackadaisical attitude of government officials, an expert 
says.

"The number of the tigers in the country has fallen to 3,500 from about 4,300 
just about a decade ago, but so far not a single conviction has taken place," 
Anjana Gosain, a wildlife lawyer and honorary secretary of an NGO - Tiger 
Trust, says.

Population growth and poaching has resulted in the extinction of three tiger 
species from the country which was a natural habitat for eight species, she 
says adding "since the forest officials are not aware of the animal protection 
rules they do not draft the complaint accordingly and as a result the accused 
goes scot free." The law to prevent the killing of endangered species was 
enacted way back in 1972, but till date there has been no conviction mainly due to 
lack of knowledge among the officials in framing the charges against poachers, 
she says.

"There was a need for serious efforts considering the falling number of 
tigers in the country," she says, adding "people need to understand that the 
animals too have a right to live on the planet and urgent steps should be taken 
before it is too late. 

Government officials, however, blame the slow judicial process for no 
conviction so far.</docText>

"Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth / My texture is the best fur, of 
chinchilla."
-- Beyonce with Jay-Z in Crazy in Love
MONTREAL - It was pretty difficult to be anti-fur in recent weeks as the wind 
chill hit a mind- and body-numbing -40 C in much of the country. And that 
seems to be the way the wind is blowing.
Fur sales in Canada and the United States have been climbing since the early 
'90s, with major spurts starting around 1999.
Younger Canadian men and women are the ones most interested in buying fur, 
according to the Fur Council of Canada. The trend is true in the U.S., too, 
where the Fur Information Council of America reports that more than half the fur 
sold is bought by women under the age of 44, and 20 per cent by women under 34.</docText>

High atop a snow-swept plateau on the Crow Reservation, bison shuffled in the 
morning sun at the sound of an approaching airplane. 
As it passed overhead, most of the shaggy giants raced to the south, while a 
few others scattered here and there. They ran for a few seconds and, as the 
plane buzzed away, regrouped on a bare patch of ground that overlooks Bighorn 
Lake, craggy canyon walls and a wild landscape that stretches to every horizon. 
On this day, the sightseers' plane was a minor disturbance for the Crow bison 
that roam 22,000 acres on the reservation. 
The rest of the winter hasn't been so easy for them - or for the people 
trying to manage them. 
Recent drought and a growing herd have pinched the food supply and sent 
hundreds of buffalo spilling off the reservation onto private and public land in 
Wyoming. 
With ranchers and government officials worried about bison feeding on cattle 
grazing allotments, Crow Agency crews this fall and winter have been busy 
trying to push the bison back onto the reservation and keep them there. Because of 
the steep terrain and deep snow, much of the work has been done in 
helicopters and aboard snowmobiles, trucks and ATVs. 
"It's been pretty hectic," said Leroy Stewart, director of the buffalo 
program at Crow Agency. 
Three people on bison crews have been injured, none seriously, including one 
man who was in a pickup truck when it rolled at the bottom of a canyon and 
another who crashed an ATV.

An incurable disease hitting Ohio's cattle, sheep and goat herds will be the 
subject of a March public meeting in Wooster.
Johne's disease -- it has been around for more than 100 years but it's on the 
rise now -- is difficult and expensive to eradicate and can cause large 
production losses. It is now considered a major farm disease problem, especially 
for cattle, say experts at the Ohio State University Extension.
The information meeting will be from 1 to 3:30 p.m. March 10 in the Fisher 
Auditorium at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.
The meeting, one of six across Ohio, will inform farmers about the disease 
and programs in Ohio for testing and control.
Johne's disease is a chronic bacterial intestinal infection that is caused by 
a germ related to those that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. It strikes 
silently, can affect a large percentage of a herd and can cause production losses, 
premature culling and loss of marketability of breeding stock.
The bacterium that causes the disease can be spread by manure and strikes 
young animals, though symptoms may not manifest themselves for years. It can also 
be spread by dirty udders.</docText>

The latest animal health crisis to arise after avian flu claimed its first 
human life in Thailand forms part of a pattern that has gone along with 
industrialisation and mass transportation of livestock. Animal disease now travels far 
and fast in types of farming and food distribution that make it very hard to 
control. 
Thailand exports large quantities of chicken to the UK and other countries in 
Europe. According to figures from the Department for the Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs, the UK imported 36,649 tonnes of poultry meat from Thailand 
in the first 10 months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year. 
The outbreak has raised two separate concerns: that the flu might spread to 
flocks in other countries, resulting in large-scale losses; and that it might 
have implications for human health. If the virus mutates it might be possible 
for humans catching it to pass it on to other humans, threatening a flu 
pandemic. 
In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw 
materials where they are cheapest. The British poultry industry has struggled to 
compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil where labour costs are much 
lower. 
Thailand and Brazil have seen the rapid industrialisation of livestock in the 
last few years as they have pushed for export-led growth. Many UK producers 
meanwhile are barely able to cover the cost of production, as prices have 
fallen in supermarkets.

Like most livestock producers, when I see that a major magazine is doing a
feature story on food or diets, I brace myself.

Anyone old enough to remember the anti-red-meat '80s is still gun shy.

But things have changed. The public's perception that red meat is bad for
you has been ameliorated in large part by two factors: the continuing
steadfast research and promotion funded by the Beef Check Off, and the
more recent acceptance of the Atkins all-meat, all-fat diet.
...
I mean, nobody praised American farmers, agribusiness, or immigrant labor
for the abundance, variety, safety, wholesomeness and relative low cost of
our food supply. And there were enough politically correct potshots to
balance out those stubborn facts that won't go away. But they concluded
that moderation in portions and balance is the right way to eat.

Wow! What a concept.
...
The letters to the editor the following week regarding the story contained
typical responses from those whose ox had been gored, including this one:

I was surprised that animal meat and other animal products were included
in your report on healthy eating. The vegan diet is the most healthful one
there is. Your body can thrive on the bounty of fresh fruits, vegetables,
grains, legumes and soy. Going vegan is the best way.
...
In response to Ms. Frisk's letter to the editor expressing surprise that
meat was included in Time's report on healthy eating, then promoting her
vegan diet as the most healthful, the real surprise is that Time will
print letters like hers. In her defense, there are nice people who still
believe the earth is flat and Communism was a good thing. But humans have
two legs, a brain and are omnivorous.</docText>

        <docText>In great ape terms, nine-month-old 
orangutan orphan CT could consider herself lucky. 
The furry orange ball's arrival at Malaysia's main orangutan centre last 
month, after a plantation owner tipped off staff about her fate, makes her future 
prospects quite bright. 
Her kin and other great ape species are not so fortunate. 
Sepilok has a strong record of rehabilitating its charges to the wild. It 
sits in Sabah state, the part of orangutan territory probably least likely to be 
destroyed. 
But orangutans elsewhere in Borneo and in Sumatra face a grave risk of 
extinction while their close African cousins gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos are 
in danger everywhere. 
Orangutans' main problems are forest fires, illegal logging and poaching of 
their babies to supply an illicit pet trade. 
Habitat loss threatens the other great apes across central and western 
Africa, which also face being killed for their meat. 
Adopted as "flagship species" by conservationists, along with animals such as 
rhinos and giant pandas, great apes have assumed the role of high-level 
envoys in extinction diplomacy. 
For orangutans, that means symbolising efforts to protect Southeast Asia's 
rainforests and other habitats, according to Geoffrey Davison, WWF Malaysia's 
Borneo Programme Director. 
"If orangutans are conserved, then other wildlife will be saved alongside 
them," he says. 
Such issues feature high on the agenda for a meeting from February 9 to 20 in 
Kuala Lumpur where government officials from around the world will discuss 
how to slow global species loss. 
Beefing up protected areas is one of the priorities of the United Nations 
Convention on Biological Diversity, the broad aim of which is to achieve a 
"significant" drop in the rate of species extinctions by 2010. </docText>

I was told that there was egg in the popcorn. Imagine that!

After I regurgitated the few grains I hungrily consumed earlier, I read
the ingredients off the microwaveable bag. Egg powder.

Next thing I'll hear is that they'll be using souse to make ice cream.

I stopped eating meat, fish and eggs many years ago whilst awaiting the
results of my first University of London examinations. I had hoped that my
sacrifice would appease the Gods and success would be granted. 
...
The weird thing about it is, when a place actually caters for vegetarians,
the "carnivores" will eat all the salads and veggie delights first then
look at the meat trays. Case in point: when vegetarian and meat topping
pizzas are ordered at the office, which of the slices go first? There's
already so little out there for a true vegan to eat, why deprive us of the
few lettuce leaves on the table?

It's been a while since I've decided not to eat anything that once had a
face or could scream in terror when it was cut and I don't miss the taste
of meat at all for those reasons. 
...
So this year I'm planning to walk with my own little bag of goodies-maybe
a few extra biscuits stuffed into my pocket for good measure-whenever I
have to go somewhere where a vegetarian is as uncommon as an honest
politician.

At least when the meat eaters have run out of options, I'll still be
happily fed.</docText>

        <docText>Bruce Chesebro is waiting for his monkeys to get chronic
wasting disease. Researchers at Rocky Mountain Laboratories here injected
a slurry of infected deer brain tissue into the brains of small,
black-eyed macaque and squirrel monkeys a few months ago.

Other monkeys drank a fruit drink mixed with the tainted brains. Today,
the monkeys sit in a room sealed off from most human contact while
scientists like Chesebro wonder if one of the world's most mysterious
vectors is eating little holes within their primate brains.

He and his colleagues are part of one of the nation's oldest and most
respected research programs into the bizarre family of brain-wasting
diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs. Here,
in a mountainous corner of Montana, researchers at the National Institutes
of Health's Rocky Mountain Labs have been quietly shedding light on TSEs
since 1961, helping to explain the suite of always deadly ailments which
includes chronic wasting in deer and elk, mad cow diseases in cattle and a
similar disease in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Their work has taken on a new urgency since mad cow disease was found in
the United States and everyone from consumers to Congress is demanding to
know more about these killers ? and how likely people are to catch them.

But what Chesebro has to say may be unsettling: He thinks mainstream
science may have been running down the wrong road for decades on TSE
research. While conventional wisdom holds that TSEs are caused by an
infectious protein, Chesebro thinks it is just as likely ? maybe even more
so ? that these diseases are really caused by some hearty ??ubiquitous
virus'' science has yet to identify. A virus present in everyone's body,
including yours.
...
?We've never seen a spontaneously infectious protein,'' Chesebro said.
??No one has ever generated it in the lab.''</docText>

Some of those proclaiming the demise of canis lupis in the eastern slopes of 
the Rockies are crying wolf. 

That's according to some area hunters and trappers, such as Debbie and Ken 
Schroderus, who snare wolves and other animals on a line west of Rocky Mountain 
House. 

"They have an idea in their heads about how many wolves there are out there, 
but there are more than they realize," says Debbie Schroderus of Leslieville, 
150 km northwest of Calgary. 

Schroderus rejects any suggestion her and husband Ken's trapping activities 
have a hand in decimating the wolf population. 

The northwest corner of their trapline touches the boundary of Banff National 
Park -- one of the areas conservationists fear have become a killing ground 
for mountain park wolf packs. 

"To think we're actually doing any damage in the west country is not true ... 
we're barely putting a dent in the wolf numbers," says Schroderus, 45. 

If anything, the couple is acutely sensitive to the ecological state of the 
Crown land they frequent and their trapping helps maintain the predator-prey 
balance, she says. 

"We do love the animals and we're not out to slaughter the entire 
population," she says. "When you control the wolves you have a larger population of elk, 
deer and moose." </docText>

        <docText>Life on Northeast 18th Avenue is slowly returning to normal.

Not long ago, the narrow dirt road was ruled by dogs. People walked, ran or 
stood on the road at their peril - and usually only if they brandished sticks 
or poles or bats or whatever they could find to defend themselves.

For years, according to residents who lived along the road, Robert Freeman's 
mixed breed pit bulls and Labrador retrievers made life "a living hell on 
earth."

"It was miserable," said Mary Alice Smothers, whose 81-year-old mother, Alice 
Broom, was mauled to death by the dogs last month. "Anytime you walk out of 
your door, you did not know what to expect. Sometimes when you opened your 
front door, the dogs would be standing right there."

One neighbor, Susan Fellows, described the dogs as "hungry wolves" and said 
they were a "clear and present danger to the community.

"You constantly had to be on the lookout for them because you never knew 
where they were or when they would strike," Fellows said.

On several occasions, the dogs did strike, often without warning, neighbors 
said.</docText>

With more than 30,000 fast-food restaurants in 121 countries around the 
globe, the company that milkshake-mixer salesman Ray Kroc bought from two 
California brothers named Dick and Mac McDonald is more than a mere restaurant chain.

For some people, it's a symbol - a symbol of American reach and power, of 
American arrogance, of the dominance and crassness of American culture, of the 
evils of globalization. 

Yes, lots of folks love to hate McDonald's - and it's not necessarily the 
food that gets them so worked up. It's the very idea of a worldwide fast-food 
chain.

McDonald's restaurants have been picketed and set on fire in France. 
Animal-rights activists have set fires at some McDonald's restaurants in America. 
Around the world, the home of the Big Mac is a frequent target of 
anti-globalization protesters and a symbol of much that is "wrong" with America.

And that kind of nonsense, folks, is what makes Joan Kroc's bequests to the 
Salvation Army and, earlier, to National Public Radio so sweet - or at least as 
satisfying as a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

Ray Kroc died in 1984 and his wife, Joan, inherited an estate then valued at 
$2 billion. And now Joan, who died in October, has left $1.5 billion to the 
Salvation Army, one of the largest individual gifts to charity ever made.</docText>

DARIEN -- Priscilla Feral has had a busy winter. When she wasn't fighting 
with the state of Alaska over wolf hunting, she was brawling with Audubon 
Connecticut over deer hunting on its Greenwich sanctuary.

Deserved or not, many animal rights groups have a reputation for extreme 
views, and those of Friends of Animals, based in Darien, may be the most radical. 
Feral, its president, is not afraid to attack not only hunters but 
environmental-protection agencies and animal cruelty prevention groups that do not go far 
enough.

Her organization is not satisfied with improving conditions on factory farms, 
or advocating for less cruel hunting techniques. Friends of Animals wants to 
abolish these practices.

"If you get to the heart of the problem, that is probably radical," Feral 
said Friday at Friends of Animals headquarters on the Post Road. "People ought to 
just stop eating animals."

Feral was born Priscilla Brockway, but after her divorce in 1974, she took as 
her last name the word that describes a domestic animal gone wild.

"I gave serious consideration to it," she said. "I did it with intent and to 
define myself."

Animals are sentient beings and there is no acceptable reason to harm them, 
according to Friends of Animals.

"We are animals, too," Feral said.

Besides Darien, the group has offices in New York City and Washington, D.C., 
employs about two dozen workers and has an annual budget of $4 million to $5 
million. Feral began volunteering with Friends of Animals in the 1970s and has 
been president since 1986.</docText>

        <docText>Brrrrr! Goodness gracious, it has been cold! None of the dogs want 
to venture too far outside; the cats are staying indoors too. Usually they 
like to snooze in their fenced-in pens, but not lately. These days the animals don
?t want to go out for any length of time. It?s uncomfortably cold for them, 
as well as being potentially dangerous. 
We know that your pets are feeling the cold also. Please remember to keep 
your animals inside as much as possible. Don?t leave your dogs leashed out all 
day, and try to keep your cats from roaming around outdoors. Just imagine how 
awful it would be if we had to be outside in this cold for too long. Please 
think of your pets! 
We?d like you to think about our pets too. Remember the Senior Program we 
introduced awhile ago? We have had a great time adopting our cats into loving 
homes with senior citizens, so we wanted to remind everyone about the program 
again. We have several cats that are still available for free adoptions to 
approved seniors. For instance, Spooker is a black cat with enormous, round eyes. 
She is docile and sweet tempered. Come on over and meet Spooker, Mickey, or 
Agatha. All these cats are friendly and affectionate and so willing to move home 
with you! 
Congratulations to Ceasar, who was adopted earlier this week. He started out 
being fostered by a first-rate family from Lincolnville. Not surprising to us, 
they fell in love with the adorable tiger cat and decided to make him a 
permanent part of their family!</docText>

  On Saturday, December 13, one of the world's leading newspapers, The
  Guardian (UK), published a lengthy article seriously questioning the 
place
  of cows' milk in a healthful diet and government subsidies for the dairy
  industry. The article looked at both the UK and the US. It is available 
on
  the web in two parts at the following addresses:

  Part One:
  http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1104740,00.html
  Part Two:
  http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1104854,00.html

  I highly recommend reading it, but will summarize it below for those who
  don't have the time to read a 5467 word piece.

  The article is headed, "DAIRY MONSTERS: We used to take it for granted 
that
  milk was good for us. But now the industry faces a crisis, with the 
public
  questioning such assumptions. So just how healthy is milk? Anne Karpf
  investigates."

  Karpf notes that there is mounting scientific evidence that "regular
  consumption of large quantities of milk can be bad for your health, and
  campaigners are making a noise about the environmental and international
  costs of large-scale intensive European dairy farming." But she comments,
  "So thorough is our dairy indoctrination that it requires a total gestalt
  switch to contemplate the notion that milk may help to cause the very
  diseases it's meant to prevent....Today, there's a big bank of scientific
  evidence against milk consumption, alleging not only that it causes some
  diseases but, equally damning, that it fails to prevent others for which 
it
  has traditionally been seen as a panacea."

  She refers to the work of Frank Oski, former paediatrics director at 
Johns
  Hopkins school of medicine, "who estimated in his book Don't Drink Your
  Milk! that half of all iron deficiency in US infants results from cows'
  milk-induced intestinal bleeding." You can buy that book at:
  www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0945383347/dawnwatch

  She discusses lactose intolerance, which causes "bloating, cramps, 
diarrhoea
  and farts.": "In 1965, investigators at Johns Hopkins found that 15% of 
all
  the white people and almost three-quarters of all the black people they
  tested were unable to digest lactose. Milk, it seemed, was a racial 
issue,
  and far more people in the world are unable than able to digest lactose.
  That includes most Thais, Japanese, Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews, and 50% of
  Indians."

  Karpf notes that milk critics say that the idea that osteoporosis is 
caused
  by calcium deficiency is "one of the great myths of our time." She 
writes,
  "In fact, the bone loss and deteriorating bone tissue that take place in
  osteoporosis are due not to calcium deficiency but rather to its 
resorption:
  it's not that our bodies don't get enough calcium, rather that they 
excrete
  too much of what they already have. So we need to find out what it is 
that's
  breaking down calcium stores in the first place, to the extent that more
  than one in three British women now suffers from osteoporosis. The most
  important culprit is almost certainly the overconsumption of protein.
  High-protein foods such as meat, eggs and dairy make excessive demands on
  the kidneys, which in turn leach calcium from the body. One solution, 
then,
  isn't to increase our calcium intake, but to reduce our consumption of
  protein, so our bones don't have to surrender so much calcium.
  Astonishingly, according to this newer, more critical view, dairy 
products
  almost certainly help to cause, rather than prevent, osteoporosis."

  She notes, "American women are among the biggest consumers of calcium in 
the
  world, yet still have one of the highest levels of osteoporosis in the
  world" and that "Most Chinese people eat and drink no dairy products 
and...
  consume only half the calcium of Americans." Yet "osteoporosis is 
uncommon
  in China despite an average life expectancy of 70." Further, "In South
  Africa, Bantu women who eat mostly plant protein and only 200-350mg of
  calcium a day have virtually no osteoporosis, despite bearing on average 
six
  children and breastfeeding for prolonged periods. Their African-American
  brothers and sisters, who ingest on average more than 1,000mg of calcium 
a
  day, are nine times more likely to experience hip fractures."

  She quotes T Colin Campbell, the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of
  Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University: "The association between 
the
  intake of animal protein and fracture rates appears to be as strong as 
that
  between cigarette smoking and lung cancer." Another quote from Campbell
  associates milk consumption with an increased risk of cancer: "Cows' milk
  protein may be the single most significant chemical carcinogen to which
  humans are exposed".

  Karpf discusses the conflicts of interest that have led to milk's status 
as
  the perfect food despite much scientific evidence to the contrary:


  "Another reason why official policy on milk is often at odds with medical
  evidence lies in the conflict of government role, both in Britain and the
  US. The US department of agriculture, for example, has the twin, and 
often
  mutually incompatible, tasks of promoting agricultural products and
  providing dietary advice. In 2000, it was still recommending two to three
  servings of dairy products a day, to the rage of critics such as the
  Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. PCRM claimed that six of 
the
  11-member drafting panel had close ties with the meat, egg and dairy
  industries (five of them with dairy).

  "Britain isn't free from conflict of interest, either. The government is
  heavily involved in encouraging us to drink milk."

  Karpf criticizes the UK's National Dairy Council advertisements, 
commenting,
  "Of course, it's no crime for the industry to promote itself; what's
  disturbing is its masquerading as a disinterested source of 
incontrovertible
  information."

  Karpf feels that perhaps the "most insidious dimension of the dairy
  fightback is funding research."

  The article discusses animal welfare concerns in detail. She starts with
  "the vegetarian fallacy" which allows people to separate the dairy and 
veal
  industries:

  "Alongside the researchers raising questions about milk sits the more
  inflammatory animal rights movement, which has recently focused its
  attention on dairy farming and what it argues is its intrinsic cruelty. 
For
  a long time, those concerned about animal welfare seemed magically to 
exempt
  milk from their preoccupations. They suffered from what Richard Young of 
the
  Soil Association calls 'the vegetarian fallacy': non-meat-eaters who 
still
  drink milk and so perpetuate the cycle that ends in crated veal calves
  destined for European dinner tables. Now many of them have begun to 
contend
  that, organic or not, there's no such thing as humane milk. For in order 
to
  lactate, cows - like humans - first have to get pregnant. Calves are
  essentially the waste by-product of the industry. What happens to them 
once
  they've done what they were created to do - stimulate a cow's milk
  production by the very fact of their being conceived?

  "Male udderless cows are of no value to the dairy industry, so if prices 
for
  male calves are low and the veal route unprofitable, most are killed 
within
  a couple of weeks for baby food or pies, to make rennet, or sent to
  rendering plants to be turned into tallow or grease or, in other 
countries,
  animal feed. Female calves, on the other hand, are bred as replacement 
stock
  for their mothers. The provision of beef essentially originates in the 
dairy
  industry: if we didn't drink milk, we wouldn't have all that extra meat 
to
  get rid of.

  "Though a male calf's life is unenviable, its mother's is no better. To
  ensure almost continuous lactation, she endures annual pregnancies. Her 
calf
  is removed from her within 24 hours of its birth. Calves hardly ever 
drink
  their mother's milk.

  She goes on to discuss the exhaustive exploitation of the cows' bodies:

  "Like agribusinesses everywhere, milk producers have tried to increase
  output while cutting costs. The victims are the cows. Today, from the age 
of
  two, they're expected to produce up to 10,000 litres of milk during their
  10-month lactation stint (before they dry off, are re-inseminated and the
  whole process starts up again). Milked once or twice (or even three 
times)
  daily while pregnant, they produce around 20 litres a day, 10 times as 
much
  as they'd need to feed a calf. The amount of milk cows are required to 
make
  each day has almost doubled in the past 30 years, because having a 
smaller
  number of high-yielding cows reduces a farmer's feed, fertiliser, 
equipment,
  labour and capital costs. That's why the variety of cattle breeds in 
Europe
  has declined so much - everyone wants the high-yielding black-and-white
  Holstein-Friesens.

  "You don't need to be sentimental about animals to pity the poor bloated
  creatures, dragging around their vast, abnormally heavy udders. Many each
  year go lame, and they rarely live longer than four or five years, 
compared
  with a natural lifespan of around 25 years. Then they are slaughtered.

  And she notes the pain of mastitis and its impact on human health:

  "The official view is that not only do dairy farmers care about their 
cows,
  but that it's in their interests to keep them healthy. The reality is 
that
  overmilking, problems with cleanliness and the choice of high-yielding
  breeds together cause more than 30 incidents of mastitis per 100 British
  cows each year. Mastitis is a painful infection of the udder. Cows' 
mastitis
  has implications for human health, too, because to control infection 
farmers
  use more antibiotics."

  Finally, Karpf discusses government efforts to protect the dairy 
industry,
  such as the food disparagement acts introduced in 13 US states, and the 
UK's
  Common Agricultural Policy, which she writes is so absurd it "will have 
you
  thinking you've woken up in the middle of a Dali painting." She details 
the
  ways in which the government props up the dairy industry at the expense 
of
  small-scale farms in developing countries, human health, and animal 
welfare.

  She asks what the alternative might be, and notes that people don't want
  their eating habits policed.  "Yet," she writes, "what we eat and drink
  isn't just the result of individual choice and cultural tradition: the
  contents of our shopping trolleys are at least equally shaped by 
government
  policy and official decisions."

  She quotes Dr Tim Lobstein, co-director of the Food Commission, an
  independent watchdog on food issues, who "advocates the removal of all EU
  subsidies from dairy production, with the money going to support 
sustainable
  forms of food production, including some organic dairy farming." He
  comments, with regard to struggling dairy farmers: "I can't help to stay 
in
  business the producers of commodities that aren't helping human health -
  they'll have to find alternative employment. The EU should help farmers
  transfer to products more helpful to human health, such as horticulture."

  Karpf calls for a national debate on milk production and consumption. She
  writes, "Part of this debate will have to be a frank appraisal of whether
  milk can jeopardise human health.... it seems increasingly clear that 
dairy
  products alone probably don't protect bone health in the way we've long
  thought, and that calcium intake on its own has only a small effect on 
bone
  density."

  The article concludes: "At the same time (and Atkins notwithstanding), 
while
  some fats are essential, the human body does not thrive on excessive 
amounts
  of milk fat. Yet milk's connotations are so primordial, its associations 
so
  pastoral and the interests that promote it so enormous, that changing the
  way we think about it, and drink it, will be a process every bit as
  challenging and root-and-branch as the loss of unquestioning religious
  faith."

A recent census of the Virunga Volcanoes mountain gorilla population has 
found that it has increased by 17 percent, according to conservation authorities 
in Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Wildlife Conservation

A recent census of the Virunga Volcanoes mountain gorilla 
population has found that the great apes have increased their numbers by 17 percent, 
according to conservation authorities in Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and other groups. 
The results indicate a total of 380 gorillas, up from 324 individuals in 1989, 
the last time conditions were stable enough to conduct such a census. 
Facing the threats of sporadic insecurity and poaching, the mountain gorillas 
of the Virungas have climbed back from a low of approximately 260 individuals 
in 1978, when many believed the mountain gorilla would become extinct. When
considered against the backdrop of regional instability during the past 
decade, the increase seems even more encouraging for conservationists.</docText>

Shifting dogs
December 2003: Networking and transportation have always been a critical part of the rescue process, especially in low-population breeds and those without well-distributed foster homes. It's not unusual for a purebred dog in a Nebraska shelter to be driven to a rescue service in Chicago that has an available foster home. Arranging transportation to permanent adoptive homes is also common. 

For the most part, these transports involve one or two dogs at a time, from a shelter to a rescue service, from one rescue to another, or from a rescue to a pre-approved adoptive home. The latter is becoming more common as the Internet helps breed rescue groups in different areas do reference and home checks for one another. About two-thirds of the messages posted on rescue email lists are requests for home checks and transport arrangements for individual dogs.

Also assisted by the Internet, entire groups devoted to transport have been created. Manned by volunteers unable to foster dogs themselves but wanting to help in other ways, the best known and most professional of these groups is the Canine Underground Railroad (CUR). CUR volunteers must meet strict membership criteria, undergo background checks, and provide references. The dogs transported must also meet a standard of temperament and health, and have had pre-travel medical care such as vet exams, vaccinations, and spay or neuter. 

On the increase, however, are transport programs that are literally cleaning out shelters in one part of the country and bringing dogs en masse for placement in another. This practice began about 10 years ago when New York's North Shore Animal League began retrieving mixed breed puppies from rural shelters in southern states and bringing them north for placement. There was, the shelter alleged, a shortage of puppies in New York thanks to aggressive spay/neuter programs and reduced breeding. NSAL provided financial grants in exchange for puppies so the shelters could establish their own spay/neuter programs. This philosophy soon spread to other large shelters in the northeast that began making treks down south to relieve their own shortages.

Attention Chicago dog owners! Alderman Virginia (Ginger) Rugai has introduced 
an ordinance that would prohibit residents from owning, transporting, or 
selling ?pit bulls.? Pit bulls are defined as American Pit Bull Terriers, 
Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, or any mix of those 
breeds. Violators will face fines of $100-1000 and/or up to six months in jail. 
The measure will take effect 30 days after its passage, and there is no 
grandfather clause for current owners. Countless responsible dog owners will 
therefore be forced to give up their canine companions.
The American Kennel Club strongly supports reasonable, enforceable dangerous 
dog laws designed to keep communities safe for both people and dogs. We 
believe that dog owners should be responsible for their dogs and that laws should 
impose appropriate penalties on irresponsible owners. In order to be effective, 
however, such legislation should judge a dog based on its deed rather than its 
breed.
What You Can Do:
Immediate help is needed to fight this proposal. Chicago dog owners are 
strongly urged to contact the City Council and express their opposition to the 
ordinance.</docText>

Dennis Kucinich Address at Animal Rights 2003 West
Los Angeles, CA - August 4, 2003

I'm very grateful for the opportunity to appear before you today, and I want to begin by saluting each and every one of you individually for your personal commitment to animal rights, and for what that commitment represents for yourselves as individuals, and for who you are in the world. 

We realize that we are in a world which truly needs compassion - that we need to extend compassion to one another and to everything living. And that our cause can truly be to lift up this world from a condition of suffering and cruelty to all creatures of this planet. And through elevating the cause of every creature, we elevate our own humanity. We lift up the cause of humanity by reaching out and connecting with all things living. It is our sense of interconnection with all living things that brings us to respect the rights of animals. That we understand that animals are not to be 'lower than.' That animals should not have less of a claim to existence, less of a claim to the possibility of survival, less of a claim to dignity.

Your commitment translates into specific action in raising the questions that must be raised about the use of animals in research, in raising the questions that must be raised about the use of animals in testing, in looking at the conditions in which animals are placed on farms. About challenging a corporate ethic which sees animals as things to be exploited and not beings which in and of themselves have some basic rights. 

So your presence here serves as a reminder to this country that our presence on this planet has a higher calling. That we can, through our activism, lift up the cause of the humblest beings. That we can, through our activism, open up not only our own hearts but the hearts of people everywhere, so that our society can become more compassionate. So that our society can be more loving. So that our society can create policies which are caring for animals. Every one of us knows a story of animal cruelty. Every one of us knows how in one way or another, official policies have sanctioned cruelty to animals.

Then: When the California National Primate Research Center opened at UC
Davis in 1962, only the administration and lab buildings stood on County
Road 98, and the animals were housed on campus.

Through the years, the center has grown and studied many diseases ranging
from asthma to Alzheimer's disease, AIDS and other infectious diseases. As
one of eight primate centers supported by the National Institutes of
Health, the center conducts research in areas related to human health and
maintains a large breeding program to support that mission. The center
operates on a nearly $7.3 million annual base grant from NIH and
additional grant funding - $24 million in grants for research this
academic year.

The center has about 4,600 monkeys, mostly rhesus macaques with small
populations of cynomolgus monkeys and South American titi monkeys. And the
center employs nearly 300 workers, including scientists, veterinarians,
animal care technicians, specialists in pathology and animal husbandry,
graduate and postdoctoral students and laboratory and administrative
personnel.

The center sits on 300 acres, of which 80 acres is developed. Expansion
and improvement projects were proposed and studied in the last few years,
but were stalled by a lawsuit filed in January 2002 by animal rights
groups Animal Protection Institute of Sacramento and In Defense of Animals
of Mill Valley, challenging the environmental review. The groups claimed
the report didn't analyze alternatives to animal testing, which they said
would lessen impacts on the environment.</docText>

THE bird flu epidemic sending a wave of fear through an Asian region still 
reeling from last year's SARS outbreak is the latest in a series of deadly 
diseases to challenge medical wisdom.

SARS, avian flu, AIDS and ebola ? increasingly we are being afflicted by a 
rollcall of nasty diseases no one had even heard of a couple of decades ago. 
And these bugs have something in common: all have jumped the species divide 
from animals to humans, raising the spectre of a dangerous, more virulent world 
where viruses emerge to launch mass attacks against us. 
The mounting death toll from the latest outbreak of bird flu in Vietnam has 
sparked talk of a flu pandemic similar to the 1918 Spanish flu that killed up 
to 50 million people worldwide. The World Health Organisation announced on 
Saturday that the flu had killed its sixth victim, a 13-year-old boy from Ho Chi 
Minh City. 
British medical journal The Lancet says in its latest issue that bird flu has 
the potential to become the world's next great pandemic. 
"The possibility of a human pandemic with a highly pathogenic avian influenza 
virus must be taken very seriously indeed," the journal says. </docText>

        <docText>If efforts to 
protect island habitat off northeast Borneo go as private managers plan, 
they may need some serious military muscle to guard the site&#x2019;s underwater 
assets from human predators.

Mature grouper, giant clams and exotic corals around Lankayan island would 
fetch big money in a poor region dogged by piracy, tourist kidnappings, and 
blast and cyanide fishing.

&#x201c;That&#x2019;s something that we have to discuss with the military, with the 
authorities and with the enforcement police,&#x201d; says Don Baker, an executive 
with management firm Reef Guardian.

&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to get hurt and we don&#x2019;t want to cause any loss of life,&#x201d; he 
added.

Such potential riches have caught the eye of the Indonesian, Malaysian and 
Philippine governments, making clear the cost of neglecting an area plagued 
by sovereignty wrangles.

Ecoregion planned
Next month, the governments are due to announce plans for a Sulu-Sulawesi 
Marine Ecoregion, tying development for the area&#x2019;s 45 million inhabitants to 
the fate of its corals, whales and turtles.</docText>

DELMAR - There is a dogfight going on between at least two area women as they 
debate the reasons behind the deaths of seven dogs.
The battle began after the dogs were found dead at the home of Robin Conner 
of Delmar. Charges of four counts of animal neglect were filed against her Jan. 
14 after a complaint was made by the Muscatine County Humane Society.
The humane society called the Clinton County Sheriff's Office based on a 
report by Mollie Kling of rural Walcott, who had been notified by Conner that four 
of her English Bulldogs had died while in Conner's care. Three more dogs, two 
of them Kling's, also were found dead on the property. As a result, several 
animals were taken from Conner's home.
According to Kling, Conner had the four dogs for only six weeks. She 
initially told Kling that the dogs must have gotten into some poison, but later Conner 
stated that the dogs had escaped about Dec. 16 and she had found them dead 
near a tree nursery.
"My hobby is showing dogs, and I had a contract with Conner to raise some 
litters," Kling said. "I called to check on the dogs often and she would tell me 
that the dogs were fine, but then she stopped calling me back after the first 
of this year. Finally, on Jan. 5th, she called and told me my dogs had died."
An autopsy performed by a veterinarian showed they had most likely died from 
starvation and exposure.

        <docText>Wildlife Protection Division changes. Howard Delo, the author, is a retired 
fisheries biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
On Aug. 4, 2003, the Fish and Wildlife Protection Division of Alaska's 
Department of Public Safety ceased to exist. The former "brownshirt" troopers were 
incorporated into the Alaska State Trooper Division, issued blue uniforms, and 
placed in a subsection of the AST now known as the Alaska Bureau of Wildlife 
Enforcement, or ABWE.
The ABWE troopers have the primary responsibility of enforcing Alaska's fish 
and game laws and regulations. The AST troopers' primary concern is the 
enforcement of the state's criminal code.
Public Safety stated that this consolidation would not impact the level of 
fish and game enforcement that previously existed and would save the state money.
Before we explore that claim, a little background is in order. Troopers in 
the defunct FWP division, now ABWE, have always had the same training and 
enforcement authority as the troopers from the AST division. In fact, the ABWE 
troopers received an additional two weeks of training in dealing with the specifics 
of wildlife enforcement that the AST trooper trainees never received. 
However, after the current trooper class at the academy graduates, this extra 
wildlife-specific enforcement training is being eliminated as a cost cutting measure.</docText>

"It?s not 100-percent foolproof. It?s more that mad cow is incredibly
unlikely to be in the kosher food supply," said Rabbi Eliezer Eidlitz,
founder of the Kosher Information Bureau (kosherquest.com) and a leading
national authority in matters of kashrut, or Jewish dietary law.

Mad cow disease turned up in a Washington state Holstein in late December.
The cow was a ?downer,? an animal too sick to walk to the slaughter. The
Department of Agriculture recently banned downers from slaughter for beef,
but that was a moot point for the kosher industry, which has never allowed
their use.
...
No kosher beef has tested positive with mad cow, as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) is colloquially called, even during the epidemic in
England in the 1990s. One cow with the disease was found in the Golan in
Israel in 2002, but it never made it into the food supply. An infected cow
can transmit the disease to humans as the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, a highly debilitating and always fatal brain-wasting disease.
...
Kosher cattle are slaughtered young ? 18 to 24 months ? before they can
acquire any illnesses or blemishes that would render them treif
(nonkosher). All cases of mad cow have been discovered in cattle over 3
years old (though the prions ? the abnormal protein that cause BSE ? might
be present in an incubative state in younger cattle).

Dairy cows ? where most cases of mad cow have appeared ? are not used for
kosher beef, because during their milk-producing years they have been
subjected to lactation-increasing procedures that make them more likely to
have a health issue that will disqualify them as kosher meat.

Kosher slaughter precludes the use of stun guns to the head, a
preslaughter procedure that could loosen and spread brain or nerve matter
? where BSE is most likely to reside. The stripping devices used in
nonkosher meat processing make it likely that spinal chord or other nerve
tissue will end up in ground or processed beef, while kosher processors do
not use such mechanisms.
...
Of course, if the mad cow furor gets any worse than it is now, people who
have gotten a quick and not-so-pleasant education in the meat industry
might opt for something even safer than keeping kosher ? vegetarianism.

Engel's Angle

Would you leave a loaded gun lying unattended around your yard, where anyone 
could have access to it?

No. That would be stupid.

Would you walk around town with an uncased, loaded gun?

No. That would also be stupid, not to mention illegal.

But hey, at least a gun wouldn't jump out of your backyard on its own will to 
shoot at those passing by. And your gun wouldn't leap from your possession to 
aim at those you meet on the

All the same, a gun is a very lethal thing, when not properly contained. That 
is why we don't often see folks leaving guns around their yard and dragging 
guns around the neighborhood.

Switch to a different scenario. An unleashed dog - one with large, powerful 
jaws that could tear through a human jugular without much problem. A dog that 
sees other smaller animals and children as little more than threatening chew 
toys. A dog whose owner has no visible control over it.

Unfortunately, it isn't uncommon to see these intimidating canines pacing 
freely around their owners' yard or walking several yards in front their owner

The Jan. 7 editorial, "Factory Farm Issue Changing," was confused when it 
suggested that fast-growing poplar trees might be "the solution" to the health 
and environmental problems created by "smelly, noxious manure lagoons" here in 
Pennsylvania. 
The closing down and cleaning up of inactive manure slurry impoundments in 
North Carolina presents quite a different set of challenges than the problems 
associated with an active factory farm that is generating thousands of gallons 
of animal waste on a daily basis. When a concentrated animal facility is in 
operation, ground water contamination, stream pollution and respiratory ailments 
are well documented and ongoing concerns. 
Unfortunately, these issues are not changing and have come to plague 
Pennsylvania. Although the Press Enterprise has not covered these stories, a manure 
spill from a massive hog operation in nearby Perry County contaminated the 
borough of Blain's community reservoir, rendering the water supply undrinkable and 
forcing residents to switch to bottled water. Also, the state's largest 
chicken farm, located near Gettysburg, polluted waterways by spreading manure on top 
of snow that was then washed directly into streams by heavy rains.</docText>

Cambridge University has axed plans for a controversial primate centre to
conduct animal research into brain diseases.

However, the centre could still be built elsewhere, possibly at a location
more protected from action by anti-vivisectionists. The UK Prime Minister
Tony Blair had backed the plan as being "of national importance".

The university blames "escalating costs" caused by years of delays and
security concerns for its decision to axe the centre. But it is being
accused by many of having buckled under a sustained campaign from
animal-rights activists who opposed the centre from the outset. 
...
Cambridge University denies it has been bullied into abandoning its
original plans and vows to carry them out elsewhere.

"It's not a Cambridge issue, it's a national issue," says a university
spokeswoman. "The prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the chief
science adviser have all made it clear they support us in this effort. We
feel confident we will work with them to find a way forward."

Anti-vivisection groups welcomed the climbdown, but feared the centre
might be sited instead at the government's highly secure facility for
biological research at Porton Down in Wiltshire, a suggestion on which the
university would not comment.

"If it were true, it would mark a truly worrying development," said the
British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. BUAV said the government
would be ducking its responsibility to debate the validity of animal
experiments "behind razor wire on military protected land where animal
testing is shrouded in even more secrecy than it is now".</docText>

Quincy finally has a new animal control ordinance.

The City Council approved the revised document by a 13-1 vote Monday night ? 
nearly two years after a local committee started working on it.

The final version breezed through the council once a controversial 
pet-registration provision was removed last week. The provision would have required pet 
owners to pay $2 to have each dog and cat registered annually. Some aldermen 
were concerned this would have amounted to ?double registration? because 
Quincy pet owners already are required to register their dogs through Adams County.

The provision was dropped after city officials received assurances the city 
will get dog-registration information from the county on a timely basis. The 
city will continue its existing cat registration program, which is conducted at 
no cost to residents.

Deputy Chief Harry Cramer of the Quincy Police Department, who served on the 
committee, said he was pleased to see the council approve the revised 
ordinance.

?It?s a good package as far as we?re concerned,? he said.

The ordinance makes a number of changes in animal control policies. For 
example, it authorizes animal control officers to pick up any cats running loose in 
the city. Formerly, the running-at-large provision applied only to dogs.

Cramer said this is a much-needed change.

?We have a growing cat problem,? he said. ?There are a lot of free-roaming 
cats in the community, and we needed to do something about trying to get a 
handle on that problem.?</docText>

Fashion magazines are full of ads with gorgeous models. Here?s one recent 
Ralph Lauren ad: beautiful, young man in tux stands nonchalantly at the bottom of 
stairs casually dangling a violin (he?s just played in a concert, one 
assumes). Standing next to him is another tall, lean model with slightly gray hair. 
Two hunks in a fashion ad for men. Except one of them is the Scottish deerhound 
named Falstaff that belongs to animal expert and animal wrangler Soso Whaley. 
Falstaff was also a guest at a recent roast of comedian Dennis Leary. 
Whaley, who lives in Kensington with her husband, Charles Hadley, and their 
16-year-old son, is featured on an outdoor program found on New England Sports 
Network (NESN) Outdoors called "CamoCountryTV," where she educates viewers 
about animals they might find in the environment. Licensed by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, she also travels 
throughout New England speaking about the symbiotic relationship between creatures. 
"This is Tiny," Whaley says taking a great horned owl out of a crate. Tiny 
scopes the room and the winter landscape through the window with large yellow 
eyes. "He?s 17 years old and he was found in Arizona, where he was hit by a car. 
It?s common for owls to get hit by cars because they?re not hot-wired to see 
cars as dangerous. Usually they?re just going after prey and that?s all they 
see. The car is in the way." </docText>

In a tidy neighborhood marked with a sign promising "Tranquil Country 
Living," a waif wrapped in a brown sweater took her first tentative steps inside her 
new home. 
As she grew bolder, she jumped on a bed, nibbled at food and stepped lightly 
through the fenced back yard. 
This dog's life looks a lot different from what it did just weeks ago. 
Donner arrived at the home of Mimi and Jim Parker on Friday, the first of 47 
Italian greyhounds to be adopted after their removal from a squalid house on 
the Northwest Side. 
Ten more dogs left the Humane Society SPCA of Bexar County later that day, 
and the rest are expected to find new homes as well. 
Mimi Parker, 51, of San Antonio, took the day off from work to acquaint 
Donner with the house and the family's other Italian greyhound, Blitzen. 
Less than an hour after Donner sat trembling in Parker's lap at the shelter, 
the 4-year-old dog pranced through the kitchen, dancing on hind legs for dog 
treats. 
"I've never seen her wag her tail that much," Parker said. 
Until Jan. 9, Donner lived in a house so filthy that city animal control 
workers wore respirators while seizing dozens of dogs, most of which were locked 
in plastic pet carriers, said Eddie Wright, a city animal cruelty investigator. 
Wright said the house was nearly dark and that "you couldn't walk without 
stepping into something." 
Through an attorney, Jamie Daily later relinquished custody of the dogs at a 
municipal civil hearing, Wright said. 
The Humane Society waived the $4,200 cost of the dogs' medical care, but 
Daily was assessed $1,720 in administrative fees to the city for collection of the 
animals.</docText>

 When she first walked a beat, New Bedford Police Officer Sheila C. Dolan 
learned something fast: This city has big dogs. 
 And that led to a second lesson. As a patrol officer, it's better to have 
the dogs on your side than face a suspicious pit bull or Rottweiler. 
 "All dogs are basically good," she said. "Good dogs, bad owners." 
 Now the 54-year-old officer is set to retire from the police department and 
has started her own dog-walking business, the first step in the transition 
from collaring perps to collaring pups. 
 Officer Dolan, a self-described "cat person," first started visiting with 
dogs in her South End patrol area. Before long, the socializing with her 
four-legged friends expanded. 
 "There were, like, 60 dogs I'd visit a day. Criminals would say, 'There's 
that crazy dog-girl,' " she said. 
 And do the dogs communicate back, a skeptical reporter asked? 
 "They do!" she insisted, adding that she always talks to the pets she cares 
for. "They like to hear someone talk to them." 
 While Officer Dolan never planned on getting a pup of her own until 
retirement, she changed her mind six years ago, when the owner of one dog on her daily 
round said he planned to put down his Akita. 
 "He didn't want to take care of him anymore," the officer said. "I didn't 
want a dog until I retired, but I wasn't going to let anything happen to my 
friend." 
 The dog, which weighs 97 pounds, now enjoys a life of ease at Officer 
Dolan's Fairhaven home. He was recently joined by Murphy Sullivan, a mixed black lab 
who is just over 2 months old. </docText>

THE VIRUSES that cause bird flu, SARS, and Ebola formerly affected only 
animals. For some reason, they crossed the border between species, and they 
infected humans. Mad cow disease traveled in the opposite direction. It crossed from 
humans to animals and back again.

 
Mad cow disease was originally caused by human cannibalism. A small tribe in 
New Zealand ate their dead relatives as a sign of love and respect for them. 
They ate everything, including the brains, where the virus multiplied. Somehow, 
the virus crossed to animals.

Because of man's greed for profit, ranchers rendered dead animals to feed to 
the grass-eating sheep. The extra protein made them grow faster and fatter. 
Thus, the virus of the disease was transferred to them. The same thing happened 
to cattle. In feed lots where cattle from the ranches were fattened, they were 
fed protein from corn, soybeans-mixed with rendered dead animals. (Rendering 
is a process by which animals are boiled in huge vats until the fat melts and 
the tissues break down. The resulting brew is then dried and mixed with animal 
feed.)

The virus punches holes in the brains of the animals so that they stagger 
about like crazy until they fall and die, hence the term "mad cow" disease.

Ebola used to be confined to monkeys. Primitive African tribes, who hunted 
wild animals for food, including monkeys, got the disease from them. Ebola is a 
horrible disease. The victim bleeds and rots from the inside-literally. Blood 
oozes out of every orifice in the body. This ooze is very contagious. 
Laboratories in the United States that used monkeys for their experiments had to kill 
all the monkeys in their compounds.</docText>

        <docText>This week, Ed Teal ran headlong into the brick wall that animal 
control in Delaware County has become.
Teal, a Yorktown-area resident, believes wild dogs have killed several of his 
chickens and ducks. Teal this week captured one of those dogs in his barn.
But his sympathies soon turned toward the dog, which was obviously starving 
and had a large growth on its neck.
So Teal tried to get help for the dog from the Muncie Animal Shelter and the 
Delaware County commissioners, who could only suggest that he take the animal 
to the Randolph County Animal Shelter.
"Everybody was telling me to go to Randolph County in this subzero freezing 
rain," Teal said. "There was just a lot of hoops to jump through."
Finally, Teal contacted Animal Rescue Fund, which arranged for local 
veterinarian John Boyce to take the dog in and, if necessary, euthanize it. But Teal 
had to get the dog on a leash and get the animal to the office first.
"All I wanted was some help," Teal said. "It's not my dog, but I wanted some 
help with it.
"Good grief, a county with more than 100,000 people can't afford a van and 
can't afford to hire someone to catch dogs and they're telling people to go to 
Randolph County in bad weather?"</docText>

        <docText>As millions of chickens are culled across Asia in a bid to stem the 
spread of bird flu, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that pigs 
could also carry the virus.
American fast-food chain KFC, formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken, is 
offering fish instead of chicken on its menu in Vietnam.
The chain's eight restaurants will temporarily replace chicken dishes with 
fish, said KFC Vietnam general manager Pornchai Thuratum. He added that KFC's 
sales had dropped by 30 per cent because of the bird flu scare.
Health officials say the bird flu virus is transmitted through contact with 
infected poultry and that properly cooked meat and eggs are safe to eat.
Still, many restaurants in Vietnam's larger cities have taken chicken off the 
menu since the flu outbreak was reported in late December.
In Singapore, KFC has been running advertisements to assure its customers 
that its chicken products are safe to eat.
Farm pigs could contract avian influenza from infected fowl or birds and, 
because the animals are also susceptible to mammalian viruses, they could act as 
'mixing vessels' to produce entirely new and virulent strains.
These flu strains, in turn, could be passed to humans.
Pigs in China had contracted the bird flu virus from infected birds that 
entered their pens, a WHO adviser told a forum at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital on 
Monday.
Emeritus Professor Dr Prasert Thongcharoen said suspected cases of pigs 
contracting the virus the same way had also been reported in Hong Kong.</docText>

The cold weather will bring a rare fashion moment with it, says Clare Coulson

No matter how many times the British get caught in the middle of an 
excruciating cold snap, we still don't seem to learn how to dress effectively. This 
time, however, all the essentials for the Arctic chill are now on the sale rails 
of stores (fashion, of course, has already hopped merrily on to spring).
 
Warm and smug: Ugg boots
Around 30 per cent of body heat is lost through the head (though it often 
feels like a much higher percentage), so a hat is essential this week, when 
temperatures are forecast to drop as low as minus seven in some areas.
The cosiest styles are the Davy Crockett or "trapper" fur hats (based on 
traditional hunting ones) that are made by designers such as ... They are not for wallflowers, but, frankly, this is no time for 
worrying about whether you stand out from the crowd.

        <docText>Riding the wave of public outcry concerning the arrest of 123
people in a raid on a dog fight in Newton County Jan. 17, the world?s
largest animal rights organization entered the fray Wednesday, calling for
District Attorney Ken Wynne to prosecute the suspects to the fullest
extent of the law.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a Virginia-based
advocacy group with more than 800,000 members, asked for not only criminal
prosecution of the suspects but also for complete psychological
examination and counseling.

?This is one of the worst cases we have ever seen here, and it?s
absolutely the largest bust ever,? PETA cruelty caseworker Daniel Paden
said. ?Our main goal is to make sure these animals are seized and (that
they are taken away from their) owners. ... We understand that a few of
the dogs are still with the owners, and they need to be taken away
immediately.?

Paden said he has received numerous calls and e-mails from angry PETA
members in response to the news of the bust.
...
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also considers instances of
animal abuse in its profiling of suspects, Paden said.

?Major drug networks have been linked to dog fighting, and in other raids,
large-scale marijuana operations and drug labs have been found. Violent
crimes are also linked to dog fights. ... Needless to say, we are relieved
to know that local authorities treat these crimes with such severity,? he</docText>

Animal shelters never know what they're getting. They have to take the bad 
with the good, and sometimes the bad is heartbreaking. 
Employees at the Bootheel Humane Society in Sikeston arrived at work 
Wednesday morning, to a pathetic sight. A sick and suffering dog left overnight in an 
outside drop box. Shelter managers insist, it shows why we must all take 
action against animal abuse and neglect. "It's horrendous," says Gabby Evans. "It's 
absolutely horrendous that someone let an animal get into this shape!"
A9-month old male puppy has less than half its hair, t here's a line from it 
mouth, down it's sides, and under it's tail, and his bottom half has no 
hair.Yet it was dumped in an outside concrete kennel overnight in single-digit 
temperatures."This collar is actually causing more problems," explains Gabby. She's 
the director of the Bootheel Humane Society. "There are open wounds. This is 
chunks of meat and hair, just falling off this dog. He's in horrible pain."
Gabby calls this a severe case of neglect and cruelty. And Sikeston's Code 
Enforcement Officer agrees."They should have taken care of the dog long before 
it got this bad, or they should have destroyed the dog," says Tom Burns. "I 
just don't see how anyone can let an animal get in this kind of shape."
"I'm sorry, buddy," the veterinarian mumbles to the puppy as she examines 
him.Dr. Colleen Retz with the Animal Health Center responded immediately. The 
puppies may have sarcoptic mange, which can be transferred to humans."It's all 
infected under his skin," she explains.</docText>

      Traffic jams along I-15 in Murray are a headache for commuters, but 
they are a boon for homeless pets.

"Kimi" flips a switch at unveiling of new electronic sign for the Humane 
Society of Utah last spring. Since then, monthly adoptions are as much as 25 
percent higher than year ago.
      More abandoned canines and felines in Utah have homes these days thanks 
primarily to a new billboard message sign for the Humane Society of Utah that 
fronts I-15 at about 4200 South.
      Last year was the best-ever adoption year for the Humane Society, with 
6,128 pets going to new homes ? the first time the number has exceeded 6,000 
in a single year.
      Gene Baierschmidt, executive director of the Humane Society, attributes 
most of the adoption success to that new sign.
      "We have a captive audience some days," he said, when the freeway 
becomes a parking lot and thousands of motorists see homeless pets pictured in full 
color on the electronic sign. The fact that the Humane Society office, 4242 
S. 300 West, is located near the freeway also helps.
      The electronic sign was installed in May, and since then the Humane 
Society has seen monthly adoption increases as high as 25 percent more than a

Heavy snowstorms could be a blessing to plants in southeast Wyoming, but a 
curse to wildlife. 
A harsh winter could increase mortality rates among big game that rely on fat 
reserves to survive cold weather. 
?One or two more storms could make the difference between having huge to 
normal mortality,? said Bob Lanka, a wildlife management coordinator with the 
Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
With less vegetation available over the years due to drought, some animals 
are getting by on low fat reserves. As a result, the availability of shrubs and 
grass takes a greater importance for deer, antelope and elk. 
Lanka said most mule deer examined at check stations last fall were in fair 
health. 
?Some looked good, some looked really bad,? he said. ?Overall, it wasn?t 
what we would like to see.? 
Big game animals typically eat shrubs during the winter, which isn?t a 
nutritious diet, even in the best circumstances. During that time, they use fat 
reserves to compensate for vitamin deficiencies.</docText>

To environmentalists, George W. Bush is the archenemy.
After three years in office, the president has few saving graces, as far as 
environmentalists are concerned. He seems bent, they say, on rolling back the 
nation's most important environmental rules, reversing years of progress 
against dirty air and water.
"It's the worst environmental record in American history," says Carl Pope, 
executive director of the Sierra Club. "The administration consistently favors 
polluting industries over health and safety."
That's why his group and other leading environmental organizations are making 
the defeat of Bush in November a top priority.
One group, the League of Conservation Voters, is breaking with the past to 
focus much of its $10 million to $12 million budget on ousting Bush rather than 
on trying to influence a handful of key congressional campaigns.

A PETERHEAD man has cast doubt over alleged sightings of the 'Beast of 
Buchan' claiming such an encounter would be highly unlikely.
David Witts, who is adviser to the Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association, says 
very few people have seen a live puma under controlled circumstances with 
which to compare such sightings of 'puma-like' cats, although he does give 
credence to the suggestion that large cats could exist almost unnoticed in the Buchan 
countryside. 
Mr Witts says far from being too big to be a dog, leopards, whether 
yellow-orange-tawny or melanistic, average under 100lbs and while loping on relatively 
short legs would appear, if anything, to be smaller than the average Golden 
Retriever.
"Pumas can be much heavier and tend to walk more 'upright' on longer legs. In 
recent times, though, there have been no proven 'black' pumas anywhere in the 
world and the 'scream' of a female puma is perhaps unlikely to go unnoticed 
in rural Buchan," says Mr Witts.
"As to whether such 'large cats' could exist almost unnoticed given 
sufficient food supply, the answer is a qualified 'yes'," he says. 
"Indeed, leopards have long had a reputation for doing so. Such a cat escaped 
within Nairobi city boundaries in the 1950s, causing considerable public 
concern. All attempts to recapture were unsuccessful, although four other leopards 
were obtained in the process, which was news to the local populace." </docText>

The talent that gave humans alone mastery over language may have been 
identified. In a new study, psychologists Marc Hauser of Harvard University and W. 
Tecumseh Fitch of the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, compared the ability 
of monkeys and humans to recognize grammar rules.

The concept of word ordering ? the idea that certain kinds of words must 
follow other types of words, as in the article-pair "a tree" ? is a basic 
component of language. The scientists played recordings of one-syllable words spoken 
alternately by a man and a woman to both cotton-top tamarin monkeys and college 
students. The monkeys looked at the loudspeaker whenever the pattern varied, 
indicating they had noticed the change; the human subjects also picked up the 
pattern alterations. The scientists then played recordings of a man speaking 
one to three words, followed by a woman speaking the same number of words. The 
rule corresponds to the "if ... then ..." phrase structure of language.

All the human subjects correctly identified pattern changes, even though they 
were often unable to articulate the structure of the pattern itself. The 
monkeys, however, recognized none of the variations. The cognitive ability to spot 
recursive language patterns may have been what allowed humans to develop 
their linguistic genius, the researchers report in the journal Science.</docText>

The issue: Vicious dogs
Our view: The city must crack down on dangerous animals on the loose before 
someone gets seriously hurt - or worse.
At what point does a problem need to escalate before somebody does something 
about it?
A Rottweiler attacked a 57-year-old woman last week in a harrowing experience 
that killed her Yorkshire terrier and left her with cuts and scrapes. Janet 
Gale was mauled by the vicious dog when she tried to protect her 7-pound Yorkie 
from its unprovoked aggression.
It took two swings from a neighbor's shovel to get the Rottweiler off a 
terrified, screaming Gale.
Dogs run loose in Freeport neighborhoods all the time. Last September, Pearl 
Brown, who resides on Adams Avenue, jumped inside her door just in time to 
escape a snarling cur that spotted her as it ran up her street. The dog had bit a 
neighbor's son before, she said.
In 2002, Stephenson County Animal Control received reports of 96 dog bites.
Friends Forever Humane Society has had dozens and dozens of large dogs over 
the years, dogs picked up as strays and show the telltale signs of maulings. 
Dogs that have been used to spar with others in illegal dogfights, volunteers 
say. Sometimes they find only carcasses, the remains of dogs torn up by other 
fighting breeds.</docText>

Mukunda Bista had gone to the revered Pashupatinath temple in the Nepalese 
capital to seek divine blessings. What he got instead was a bill for over 
Rs.10,000 - thanks to a monkey! 

Bista had to buy expensive vaccines for his companions, who were scratched 
and bitten by the simian. He himself was slapped in the face.

His plight is by no means unique.

Two major holy sites in the city, the Pashupatinath temple and the shrine of 
Swayambhunath, revered by both Hindus and Buddhists, are the happy hunting 
ground of the primates who are allowed a free rein because of the religious 
belief that monkeys are an incarnation of Hindu god Hanuman.

Several other temples are also thronged by the animals who often attack 
passers-by carrying food.

According to the CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Centre in Nepal, most animal 
exposures to travellers occur in Kathmandu, with monkey bites and scratches 
accounting for 43 percent of all "exposures in tourists". 

Not just devotees. The primates now seem to be targeting diplomats too. 

This month several news agencies reported that monkeys had invaded the Indian 
embassy in Kathmandu, one of the greenest spots in the city, attacking people 
and even destroying equipment. 

Last week, the Kathmandu Post daily reported that an adult monkey was 
terrorising visitors to the Pashupatinath temple, with the number of its victims 
crossing 20.</docText>

Win Rice of McDonough has been a hunter since he was a child, and he wants
that tradition to carry on.

That's why he supports the movement to make hunting a right under the
Georgia Constitution.

"It will protect the rights of my kids and the kids of everybody else
who's into this sport," Rice said.
...
The amendment would change the constitution to assert that "the tradition
of hunting and fishing and the taking of fish and wildlife shall be
preserved for the good of the people," according to the House bill.
...
"What are we fixing here? Has there ever been a challenge to this?" said
Rep. Bob Holmes, D-Atlanta.

That's not the only problem Clayton County Humane Society Vice President
Robin Rawls sees with it.

"Hunting is a special interest," Rawls said. "I don't think our
constitution needs to give rights to special interests."
...
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources also supports the amendment,
though they worked with the bills' sponsors to make sure the wording did
not impinge on the department's ability to regulate the sport, DNR
spokeswoman Beth Brown said.

Rawls, who is also a member of the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals organization, said that like most animal rights advocates she
would like to see hunting made illegal altogether.

"But the reality is, where we live, it probably isn't going to happen,"
Rawls said.

At the same time, Rawls said she thinks the interest in hunting is
declining. She also questions the amendment effort as a way to prevent the
passage of a law that may one day have the support of the majority.

Birds were dying on an island off the coast of Florida, and people 
didn't know why. A group of conservationists wondered if the culprit might be 
a pesticide sprayed into the air to wipe out mosquitoes. The explanation 
quickly came from an unlikely source in Wisconsin.
For several years, Warren Porter, a professor of zoology at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, has been working with faculty and staff across campus to 
develop a computer model that could predict how animals, living on a real 
landscape anywhere on Earth, would respond to specific changes in the environment. 
The model could answer questions, such as how warmer temperatures would alter 
the activity patterns of squirrels in southern California or how removing the 
forest canopy in Yellowstone National Park would affect the elk that took 
cover under it during winter.
"If we fail to answer questions like these, we will continue to lose species 
- and their genomes, the biological libraries that have accumulated 
information for billions of years - from this planet," says Porter.
But many of the models that had been designed to address ecological concerns, 
he adds, were inadequate: They didn't take into account the complexity of 
factors involved in the interaction between animals and their environment. To 
achieve a more sufficient model, Porter needed to integrate animal morphology, 
physiology and behavior with features of the climate, topography and vegetation 
of a particular area. 
"Models are always an approximation to reality," he explains. "You design 
them to ask specific questions. As the questions become more complex, the models 
become more complex. As computers have gained more power, we have been able to 
continue to add complexity and to solve very difficult problems."
At the heart of Porter's integrated model is an understanding of energy 
transfer between animals and their surroundings. For instance, the animal's 
physical properties - body size, fur thickness, body temperature and breathing rate - 
help determine how much energy it needs to survive. The animal's behavioral 
patterns, such as how often it reproduces or how active it is, also are 
important factors. 
To apply this information in a real context, scientists must also determine 
how much energy is available based on environmental factors, including 
rainfall, temperature, vegetation, topography, sun exposure and time of day or year. 
The model, which incorporates remote satellite sensing and large-scale global 
climate models, can determine this.
Because Porter's model integrates all this information on animal physiology 
and behavior and climate conditions in a predictive model, the scientist says, 
"it can help us understand what the critical processes are that affect life 
processes on earth and how specific changes in environmental conditions may 
modify or even terminate those life processes." </docText>

    On Aug. 6, 2003, at Paa-Ko subdivision in Sandia Park, citizens got a 
vivid example of what happens to a human-habituated bear under current state 
policy, i.e. "A fed bear is a dead bear" and "three strikes and you're out." Thus 
a friendly, 2-year-old birdfeeder bear was shot dead by New Mexico Game and 
Fish (NMGF) officers in front of horrified BearWatch stewards, residents of 
Paa-Ko.
    Bear #106 had become a problem; even the stewards were not sure what to 
do given the life or death circumstances. We (someone) take an innocent animal 
(a cub), make it people-friendly, and then ...
    There was no question in the minds of state officials about what to do: 
this "ruined," too-trusting bear had to get the big stick in the interest of 
public safety. The opportunity was there; the animal was dispatched and hauled 
off to the dump. Lesson accomplished.
    The finale for bear #106 (tag) is unsatisfactory husbandry, indeed 
unacceptable in our age of presumably enlightened wildlife management/stewardship. 
But what specifically to do about 106 was a real problem given the diversity of 
views of people connected with the matter. The state's policy-solution is 
impeccably rational, tilted to maximizing safety; it is also callous, dogmatic 
and incomplete. The following is an appeal that suggests a partial remedy to 
such dilemmas as the Paa-Ko bear, assuming there will be similar cases in the 
future. Not every "naughty" bear (it's always the bear that misbehaves, is trashy 
and out-of-place, you know) can be preserved, but wildlife services can do 
better than it did on Aug. 6 at Paa-Ko.</docText>

Last year's 16-day, 13-county Georgia alligator season left thousands of 
hunters wishing for more gator-hunting opportunities in state waters.
This year, those hunters might get their wish.
During a series of public meetings next week, officials from the Georgia 
Department of Natural Resources will outline a proposal for dramatic expansion of 
the state's second alligator season. The proposal would make gator hunting 
legal in 27 more counties, while increasing the number of hunting permits issued 
from 180 to 300.
John Bowers, a senior wildlife biologist with Georgia DNR's Wildlife 
Resources Division, said high hunter interest is the chief reason the changes are 
being considered.
"We received over 2,000 applications for permits last year," Bowers said. "I 
don't think any of us expected that. It created a buzz all across the state."
It created a buzz outside the state as well.
"We had applicants from Alaska, Utah, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine -- some 
of the most amazing places," Bowers said. "It's easy for us to forget 
sometimes that not everyone has opportunities for alligator hunting like we have. If 
people from those states want to hunt gators, they have to come down South -- 
the same way people in the South have to go out West for elk hunting."</docText>

   A stranger uses a bow and arrows to kill someone's two Labrador retrievers.
   A city amends an ordinance for the specific purpose of getting one 
particular "exotic" pet to pack his alligator bags and leave town.
   A German shepherd is missing for more than two months after it bolts from 
the care of a paid dog sitter.
   For most people, these events -- all well publicized in Portland area 
media -- provoked feelings of outrage, amusement or sympathy. But to Portland 
pet-law attorney Geordie Duckler, they present the opportunity to advance the 
developing field of pet law.
   "My most famous case is Al the alligator," said Duckler, who was quoted in 
a 2003 New Yorker article entitled "The last meow: How far would you go for a 
pet." He said Beaverton amended an ordinance "solely to go after (my 
client's) alligator, which wasn't a huge alligator."
   With Americans spending more money than ever on their pets -- an estimated 
$31 billion last year, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers 
Association Inc. -- it's not surprising that pet owners, and lawyers, would 
come together.</docText>

Jeffrey Masson intends to clean up farming. To stop us exploiting animals in 
any form: no milk, no cheese, no eggs, no wool, no hides and, of course, no 
meat. Keeping animals is wrong; domestication (but not of dogs or cats) a 
terrible cul-de-sac in our relations with the wider world. Farmers should keep to 
crops. 
His route to this conclusion is a dual carriageway, one lane an exposition of 
the inner life of goats, sheep, cows, pigs and poultry. By means of a 
thousand anecdotes, he tries to demonstrate that animals have a higher emotional 
life, a step beyond the mere workings of instinct. Animals are no different from 
humans. Were he Dr Dolittle (and sometimes he thinks he is), he would have a 
merry conversation with any of these species. The faster lane is directed 
towards the wild state of farmed animals, or their avatars. In the dawn of time, 
they enjoyed the full play of their emotions, and domestication is highway 
robbery. 
Ignoring rights and wrongs, we get an entertaining survey of the main 
emotional characteristics of farmed animals and a sobering account of how these have 
been ignored by farmers and, above all, by modern intensive agriculture or 
factory farming. Much of what he says is indisputable, and quite tragic. None of 
us would willingly endorse what is done in our name in the poultry sheds of 
Thailand, the milking parlours of Somerset, the cattle feed lots of the American 
west, or the goose-stuffing farms of the P?rigord. Yet we seem to shrug our 
shoulders and eat it anyway. Impotent, we abdicate responsibility. </docText>

Guam Animals In Need is organizing a reduced-cost spay and neuter clinic. The 
clinic is scheduled from tomorrow to Feb. 8 at the No Ka Oi Termite and Pest 
Control warehouse located past Happy Mart along Cepeda Way in Radio Barrigada. 
For those residents who want to take advantage of this opportunity, here are 
some notes to remember about the clinic: 
Services are based on first-come, first-serve basis. No appointment is 
necessary. 
The clinic will accept dogs and cats eight weeks and older. 
Dogs and cats in heat or pregnant are accepted. 
Do not feed adult animals after midnight the night before surgery. 
Bring pets between 7 and 8 a.m. 
Have dogs on a leash and cats in a carrier or pillowcase. 
AT A GLANCE 
Spaying and neutering is one of the things we can do to help curb 
overpopulation of unwanted animals. But they also have other benefits: 
Spaying female dogs before their first heat can significantly reduce the risk 
of developing breast and uterine cancers. 
Neutering male dogs reduces roaming up to 60 percent, reduces humping 
behavior and reduces the chances of developing prostate problems. 
Spaying female cats reduces the risk of uterine cancers. 
Neutering male cats reduces, by 90 percent, their tendency to spray while 
indoors.

Dino the dog wasn't just another handsome face. He got the acting job because 
of his ability to release a squirt bottle trigger with his paw.

Dino's new life - more glamorous than his old one in the Las Vegas pound - is 
now focused on helping to sell fabric deodorizer. The cute mixed-breed is 
featured in "Dogs and More Dogs," a public television NOVA show that show 
celebrates man's best friend.

"Dogs" (airing 8-9 p.m. EST Tuesday Feb. 3; check local listings) is a fun, 
eclectic combination of whimsical cartoons and science with an added dash of 
humanity thrown in to remind viewers just why people love dogs so much. It 
explores dogs' genetic origins and the biology behind floppy ears, curved tails, 
spotted coats, short legs, long snouts and other canine traits.

"I think the most adorable thing is just all the dogs. The extraordinary, the 
most interesting thing is the science of it, how in the world the dogs become 
the varied species, how their roles become specialized genetically," show 
host John Lithgow said in a telephone interview. The actor is a self-proclaimed 
dog lover who walks his own 7-year-old Australian blue merle shepherd, Blue, 
every day in New York's Central Park.</docText>

Most animal lovers have at least one friend who has several animals. When you 
walk into their home, your nose tells you that more than one or two cats are 
present.

It may even be you who struggles with or worries about pet odors in the home. 
But now imagine walking into the home of a person who had more than 50 cats. 
Your nose might sting and your eyes could water.

"How could anyone live like this?" you might think, as you look around and 
see animals, their fur or feces, everywhere.

When people take responsibility for more animals than they can reasonably 
provide care for, that is called animal collecting. It's kind of like not being 
able to resist bringing one more African violet home - except that these are 
living, breathing, eating and defecating creatures who require far more love and 
attention than a plant.

Another problem with owning too many animals is that the vet costs become 
impossible to pay, and owners begin to let spaying and neutering, routine 
vaccination and health checks slide. More animals are produced, making the problem 
worse and worse.

In most cases, collectors believe that they are doing a good thing by keeping 
the animals from a possible death or a home where the animals will be 
"mistreated." They don't realize the conditions that they are keeping their animals 
in constitute neglect.

"I remember one house I went to, someone commented, 'Isn't this better than 
the cats being dead?' After all, they had food," said Lisa Wathne, regional 
director for the Humane Society of the United States, who has visited the homes 
of several animal collectors.

"My response is 'No.' In this particular house, there was no fresh air. The 
ammonia smells were terrible. There was not one soft, clean spot where a cat 
could sleep," She said. "That can't be considered humane - there's more to life 
than having food to eat."

Some collectors consider themselves to be rescuers, providing homes to 
animals that might otherwise be killed or injured outdoors or euthanized at a 
shelter.

Legitimate rescuers, however, are always able to provide care for the animals 
in their home.

There may be minor odors, but each animal receives fresh food and clean water 
and has urine and feces removed on a daily basis. Rescuers seek and pay for 
veterinary care, and all their pets are spayed or neutered or separated by 
gender. They also try to find permanent homes for the animals they are caring for.

Collectors are often too overwhelmed to provide this minimum level of care, 
cannot afford veterinary care and do not advertise the animals for adoption. 
These collectors can be a problem for neighbors, who notice odors and animals 
wandering the area.</docText>

        <docText>Canine smiles and puppy-brown eyes abruptly pop up above the gray 
cement walls as two shelter assistants walk through the back door, touching 
off an instant storm of Morse code-like barking. Several years and hundreds of 
dogs past their first days at the Animal Care Center, Melissa McWhorter and 
Bonnie Berry are accustomed to the exuberant greetings of pound dogs and the 
quiet stares of the cats. 
At the moment their conversation was competing with the chatter of more than 
30 dogs housed at the shelter on Lancaster Road. 
With careful attention from Berry, McWhorter and shelter manager Lois Oliver, 
a little charm and lots of luck, some of the animals might find a new home 
outside the gray room. But it is the dedication and determination of the women 
that plays a big role in sending many animals home. 
Much of what the women do is not a requirement of the job, but rather a 
calling, a labor of love for the animals they temporarily house. McWhorter and 
Berry place pictures of the animals on the walls of Fort Logan Hospital and 
Wal-Mart, advertise them on the radio and in local newspapers, any place a 
prospective pet owner might be. 
And if that is not enough, they take their work home with them. 
"Every animal that we have at home came from here," McWhorter said. 
Between the two assistants, their homes have become habitats for close to 10 
pets. Pictures of many more hang on Berry's refrigerator doors in tandem with 
her daughter's artwork. 
"I look at them and wonder how they're doing. I have a whole stack of them," 
said Berry. "It tickles me to death when they get adopted." </docText>

        <docText>The Pennsylvania Game Commission board of commissioners held 
what has annually become their most important meeting of the year Sunday, ... 
... Monday and Tuesday of last week at the commission's Harrisburg 
headquarters. 
Included in the board's actions are changes to antlerless license 
applications, a proposal to allow crossbows to be used for hunting and the expansion of 
elk, bobcat and youth squirrel seasons. 
Following are the highlights of the meeting as outlined in the commission's 
recent press releases. 
To offer hunters additional deer hunting opportunities, especially in 
urbanized areas, the commissioners gave preliminary approval to a measure to further 
expand the use of crossbows for hunting in Pennsylvania. 
Under the measure, which must be approved in April before taking effect for 
the 2004-2005 seasons, crossbows could be used statewide for bear and elk and 
during any of the firearms deer seasons, including the regular two-week 
concurrent deer season, the early muzzleloader season and the late flintlock season. 
In addition, for hunters in Wildlife Management Units 2B, 5C and 5D - the most 
urbanized areas in the state - crossbows would be legal during any 
established deer season.</docText>

Stray animals are a problem for most local communities. While most cities 
have ordinances and programs in place to deal with animals who are roaming at 
large, enforcing the programs are very costly. Depending on the city, the 
ordinances and policies dealing with stray animals vary.
Farmington
Shirla Boyd has been serving as the animal control officer in Farmington 
since 1998. Boyd has taken the homeless pets found in Farmington onto the 
information superhighway as the Farmington Police Department has joined Petfinder.com, 
a database of homeless pets.
"Once a pet's photo and description is added to our database, its chances of 
being adopted go up substantially," said Betsy Saul, president and co-founder 
of Petfinder.com.
Internet users can view pets that have impounded by the Farmington Police 
Department at http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/MO230.html.
Last year Boyd said the city collected 1,085 dogs and cats. Of those only 118 
were claimed by their owners. The majority of the dogs and cats impounded by 
Farmington go to Petsmart in St. Louis for adoption through the St. Francois 
Society.
Boyd said that owners will pay a $3 fee for the first day their pet is 
impounded, $1 for any additional days and if their pets are found running at large, 
owners are given a $75 ticket and have to pay court costs.
In addition to dogs and cats, Boyd also catches wild animals that are causing 
problems in the city.
"I've caught several snakes, skunks and possums," said Boyd. "I turn loose 
the raccoons, possums and the squirrels that I catch in their natural habitat. 
If I catch a skunk I have to take it to the range to be destroyed because they 
can carry rabies. The fire department, the police department and myself had to 
chase a button buck deer a while back. We chased it for two weeks. Its mother 
got hit on Route D and it kept coming into town. Finally it got with the rest 
of its family and took off."</docText>

We have always lived with animals. Early settlers came into the area with 
horses or oxen, some of which pulled wagons over the difficult terrain. Dogs came 
too, alerting settlers to strangers, sometimes accompanying hunters. 
The earliest concern about animals appears in the minutes of the towns where 
laws were passed concerning pigs: Were they to be free boarders or would they 
be contained? 
Free boarding pigs were, of course, easier for the owner as the animals 
rooted around for food themselves, feasting on fallen nuts, roots and other 
edibles. Free ranging pigs, however, could also pose a threat to neighboring garden 
patches and sometimes to small children. In the Village of Ithaca, pigs were to 
be contained, although cows roamed the streets well into the 1820s. In the 
Town of Ulysses, pigs were allowed to roam and householders fenced garden plots 
to keep the destructive animals out. 
Care of animals was generally left up to the owners until the 1880s, when the 
Society for the Prevention of Crime, led by Professor Jones and Director 
Marsh, began a campaign to "clean up" Ithaca. Their concern included wayward 
youth, irresponsible fathers, young girls who walked along Aurora Street, and the 
treatment of animals. The SPC provided the spark that led to what we now know 
as the SPCA -- the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
An important aspect of animal care was animal training. We wanted the animals 
that lived with us, especially dogs, to behave well, and not to disturb or 
annoy our neighbors. Few people in the 20th century kept cows or pigs in the 
city, but many had dogs and their behavior became a concern. People didn't want 
dogs leaping out and frightening children or visitors. We began to think of 
dogs as well-behaved, home-tending family members. 
To become our ideal, dogs needed training.

Last year, more than 750,000 people joined or renewed their membership in
the Sierra Club, presumably because they believe in its historic mission
to protect America's public lands and wilderness for future generations.
John Muir and a small band of conservationists founded the club in 1892,
and it's been working for more than a century to protect our nation's wild
lands, wildlife, air and water.

But recent events now threaten to divert the Sierra Club from its mission.
In early January, 13 past presidents of the club wrote to its current
board of directors to express "extreme concern for the continuing
viability of the club." They warned of an "organized effort" to take over
the board of the Sierra Club in order to move personal agendas "and to use
the funds and other resources of the club to those ends." Those agendas
are narrow, focusing on animal rights and anti-immigration policies.

In a speech to the 2003 Animal Rights Conference in Los Angeles, newly
elected Sierra Club board member Paul Watson boasted: "We're only three
directors away from controlling that board. We control one-third of it
right now. And once we get three more directors elected ... we can use the
resources of the $95 million-a-year budget to address some of these
issues. ... So, you know, a few hundred or a few thousand people from the
animal- rights movement joining the Sierra Club - and making it a point to
vote - will change the entire agenda of that organization."
...
The Sierra Club is an environmental organization. It is not an
animal-rights organization. As for immigration, the club's membership has
already voted to stay out of the immigration wars.</docText>

MEMBERS OF THE Earth Liberation Front destroyed four houses under
construction outside San Diego in September. The arsonists left a message:
"Development = Destruction. Stop raping nature. The ELFs are angry."

These homegrown terrorists wanted to stop urban sprawl by any means. They
had a simple message, a simple goal and simple minds. Somehow, they had
concluded that development is a form of "raping nature." 
...
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has funded the ELF
in the past, has launched a campaign to convince children that animals
should essentially have the same rights as humans and that the meat
industry is to be despised.

Most recently, the group has started distributing to children a graphic
flier that shows a knife-wielding woman stabbing a rabbit. The leaflet
reads, "Your mommy kills animals!"

Also, PETA's kids' Web site asks, "Does the thought of chowing down on one
of your friends give you the creeps? How about eating something that may
as well have been dunked in the toilet? Well, this is the place for you!
This site is for kids who care about animals and don't want to eat them."
...
At no other time in history have we had access to such a variety of media.
Unfortunately, instead of taking advantage of this, my peers tend to read
only The Nation or to listen to only Rush Limbaugh. The exchange and clash
of ideas is good only if there's an actual exchange of ideas.

It's time to dispose of our partisan mindsets and debate an issue or two
while considering the possibility that the other side might be right - or
at least not as wrong as we originally thought.

A steady dose of reality and debate may be healthier than accepting a
convenient delusion.</docText>

Somewhere in the desert mountains there?s a young puma with some big 
decisions to make.

If the 2-year-old lion known to scientists as M-6 tries to stake out 
territory too close to people, he could wind up on the business end of a depredation 
permit, essentially a state license to kill troublesome wildlife.

If he sticks to the back country and stays out of trouble, he has a chance to 
live his life as the top dog in the wildlife food chain.

So far M-6 -- spotted electronically west of the La Quinta cove Dec. 20 -- isn
?t tipping his paw.

But the scientists tracking him by radio collar know that if the big cat 
preys on humans? pets or livestock, he is increasingly likely to meet an untimely 
demise.

In the decades since 1972, the number of permits issued for killing mountain 
lions has increased more than tenfold statewide, according to figures from the 
California Department of Fish and Game.

Although Riverside County isn?t a hotbed of mountain lion activity, there 
were 47 mountain lion depredation permits issued since 1972 -- 32 of them since 
1990.

A depredation permit is a piece of paper that allows the bearer to kill a 
mountain lion accused of damaging or destroying human property -- usually 
livestock, but pets also count.

"When a cat no longer fears man and is going to come down into his domain, I?
m sorry, the cat has to go," said Woody Adams, who lives with his family in 
Snow Creek Canyon, just north of Palm Springs.</docText>

It's two o'clock in the afternoon - do you know where your pet is? Or better 
yet, what the critter is up to?
It's likely Fluffy is tearing up the carpet or Fido is chewing on the sofa. 
Maybe Bowser is protesting your lengthy work day and the lack of attention he's 
receiving.
Animal psychologists would tell you the finicky pets just need some love.
Aberdeen pet sitter Suzette McQuillen might agree, but she also knows that 
the animals want some food and dogs especially require a bathroom break.
McQuillen, owner of four cats and one puppy, started Paws &amp; Claws Pet Sitting 
in 1998 based on this premise.
She now belongs to Pet Sitters International, a worldwide trade organization 
for folks in the cat- and dog-sitting business.
"Pet sitting has definitely taken off," said Sheila Smith, spokeswoman for 
Pet Sitters International, a King, N.C.- based organ- ization.
The industry has grown even during the recent turbulent economy, Smith said. 
The organization has 5,800 members nationwide, three in South Dakota.
Smith said pet sitting gives people an alternative work choice - one that 
they enjoy.
"My whole life I've loved animals," McQuillen said.
The business started with an idea McQuillen had during a Maine vacation in 
December 1998. She said her friends had five cats and worried who would care for 
them while they traveled.
"I thought, 'jeez, what if I looked out for people's pets,' " Suzette said.</docText>

Today, the cattle and crop industries in Iowa are owned by massive
agribusinesses which keep thousands of head in tight quarters. The waste
created by this is extraordinary, and goes straight into the ground.
Likewise, massive industrial pig farms create untold thousands of gallons
of pig manure which are stored in huge ?lagoons.? No material crafted by
human ingenuity can contain this caustic filth, and so these lagoons
breach their containers and further contaminate the water table. The
stench from these lagoons is so extreme that houses a mile downwind become
covered in flies.

In five years, the aquifer underneath the state will be completely
polluted by dung and chemicals. The topsoil, denuded by factory farming,
will continue to disappear, and continue to require chemical fertilizers
to bring forth the crops. The introduction of genetically modified crops
to the landscape, meanwhile, will change the ecosystem in ways we do not
even begin to understand.
...
Recently, America endured its first Mad Cow scare. We were told that
everything was under control, but this was a fantastic lie. Mad Cow is
transferred two ways: In the manure or in the feed, two conduits that are
demonstrably connected. Factory cattle farms in Iowa feed their animals an
incredibly dangerous mixture. A massive turkey farm north of Des Moines
composts the corpses of dead turkeys, mixed with the sawdust bedding they
live in. The product of this is sold to the factory farms, which mix it
with rotten candy bars purchased from candy manufacturers.
...
If you think this problem is limited to Iowa, you are dead wrong. David,
the man driving the van, described all of this to me in the context of
Iowa, and in the context of the farm his grandfather owned there many
years ago, but it is a national crisis. When Dennis Kucinich went on later
that weekend to discuss farm policy, the control of genetically-modified
crops, and a process of moving away from corporate concentrations of power
in agriculture, it wasn?t just pandering to the farm voters.
...
There is an assumed caricature of the typical Kucinich supporter that has
worked its way into the public consciousness. People who support Kucinich
are moonbeamers who commune with crystals, and who are fifth-level vegans
who only eat food that doesn?t cast a shadow. I was fully expecting to
meet crowds of people asking Kucinich if he would sign their auras. The
reality, I quickly saw, was far different.

Kucinich stopped at coffee houses, at town halls, at art galleries, and
was met each time by hundreds of people. Often, there was no room inside
these places because of the crowds, and dozens of people were forced to
wait outside in 18 degree temperatures and a bitter wind. They waited. And
waited. And waited. And finally met the candidate. And left feeling
supercharged.

I met veterans, and union workers, and college kids, and grandmothers.
Here and there were the occasional Grateful Dead tour refugees, but one
can find these folk within virtually every campaign. These were very
normal people, and they all loved Dennis Kucinich.</docText>

        <docText>Kosher World Conference &amp; 
Expo, the international tradeshow for expanding kosher markets, comes this week 
to the prestigious Los Angeles Convention Center for its inaugural event. 
Showing off the future of kosher, from healthy meat to dairy-free to Halal and 
other ethnic food groups, Kosher World is demonstrating that kosher is one of 
the world's largest brands. 
Mike Schall -- former President &amp; CEO of The B. Manischewitz Company and 
Guiltless Gourmet, and with positions held at Wise Foods, Lawry's Foods, and 
Carnation -- kicks off the event with his much anticipated forecast of the Kosher 
industry potential in the next few years. 
With thousands already pre-registered to visit the show, nearly 100 
participating organizations in exhibit hall, 18 conference sessions (many of which 
accredited by the American Dietetic Association or approved by the American 
Culinary Federation for continuing education), Kosher World is set for not only a 
fabulous inaugural expo, but a world class conference. 
"Kosher does so much for so many -- not just the ethnic markets, but 
vegetarians, and those looking to avoid dairy -- that it was time for a world class 
event to show off all the benefits of kosher," said Neil Ticktin, CEO of Kosher 
World. "Our exhibitors demonstrate and sample products. Our speakers educate 
in our world class conference track. And, our attendees will walk away with an 
understanding that nearly everyone can find benefit in kosher products."</docText>

"Shelter Dogs"

"What happens to the approximately five million abandoned and unwanted dogs
who end up in shelters across the U.S. each year? Only a quarter of
America's shelter dogs ever find new homes, presenting a murky moral debate
for those who care for the leftovers.

"Through a unique window into an upstate New York shelter, this documentary
takes a hard, bold look at a tough dilemma.

"Premieres Tuesday, January 27th at 7:30pm ET/PT"

State lawmakers are unlikely to put any profound stamp on the ongoing 
efforts to alleviate worries about mad cow disease. With the federal 
government controlling the investigation and Congress monopolizing the 
debate over what so-called "downer" cows can be used for after they are 
slaughtered, the state Legislature seems resigned to take only baby steps. 
"We're going to have to take some sort of lead from the federal 
government," said state Rep. Mark Schoesler (R-Ritzville). "We're going to 
go through fine-tuning some of these measures. If there's a better idea out 
there, I'm open to it."

Perhaps most notably, the Legislature is mulling plans that would prevent 
the sale and transport of downer cows, or animals that can't stand up 
because of injury or illness.


Lawmakers also are discussing proposals to give meat packers a tax break, 
develop an animal identification system and refine the state's ability to 
quarantine diseased animals. The proposals are somewhat modest, though not 
without value, lawmakers say. Two of them - dealing with quarantines and 
animal identification - were in the works long before the mad cow 
discovery.

The greatest debate is likely to be reserved for what limitations, if any, 
lawmakers put on the use of downer cows. Bills introduced in the 
Legislature would ban only the sale and transport, except to deliver the 
animals to a veterinarian. The Washington Cattlemen's Association and the 
Washington Dairy Federation have backed that plan. However, those measures 
- House Bill 2802 and Senate Bill 6408 - do not put limits on what downer 
cows can be used for after they are euthanized.

The business of social change is often a complex undertaking. There are many tactical approaches that can be used to pursue similar goals. These axioms are in evidence in a flap that's developed between The HSUS and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in our separate dealings with The Iams Company?the pet food company that is co-sponsoring Pet Fest America in six cities across the United States. 
PETA believes The HSUS should not co-sponsor an event with Iams because a PETA investigation turned up troubling information about the treatment of dogs at a contract research facility doing work for Iams. The story broke on March 25, 2003, with the posting of graphic images, including images of cats who were not included in the Iams-sponsored study. The HSUS, of course, strongly agrees that no animals should be subjected to de-barking, invasive surgery, forced feeding, or lack of socialization simply for nutrition studies. 

The HSUS looked into the matter, after PETA brought the issues to light, and asked Iams what corrective actions it would take. Iams was already in the process of investigating the circumstances; almost immediately, it terminated the project at the laboratory where PETA's investigation occurred. The company removed its 19 dogs back to its own facility and then adopted them out to employees. Iams conducted inspections of all remaining study sites, terminating a number of studies, and reasserted the importance of the company's humane care policies at the remainder. 

The HSUS has neither endorsed the past actions of Iams, nor the company's current practices. We are, however, working with the company to see that any animals under its care are properly treated. What's more, we are demanding that the company move away from laboratory tests that might cause harm to the dogs and cats, and put their resources into clinical studies that result in no harm. 

In short, The HSUS has chosen a different tactical approach than PETA. We have chosen the course of discussion and co-operation rather than confrontation. We did not invent this approach. It is similar to one first developed by Henry Spira, an animal activist highly regarded for his successful tactics, and we believe it can work in many circumstances.

Bill's supporteSpectators at illegal dog- and cockfights would be subject to 
criminal penalties under a bill proposed by Del. Charles Boutin, R-Harford. 
Watching such dubious sports encourages them to continue and contributes to 
other illegal activities that tend to follow such fights, according to speakers 
at a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday. 
Boutin's bill would making observing animal fights a misdemeanor subject to 
90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, but would make breeding or transporting 
fighting dogs a felony worth three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Arranging 
cockfights, breeding fighting birds or fitting fighting birds with enhancements 
-- knifelike implements called gaffs or slashers or other names -- also would 
be felonies subject to the three-year, $5,000 penalty. 
In addition, cockfighting is a threat to agriculture, Boutin said, because a 
virus associated with fighting known as "Exotic Newcastle Disease" could 
spread to commercial poultry. 
The disease, which wreaked havoc in California in 1971 and led to the 
destruction of 12 million birds, is both a contagious and fatal viral disease 
affecting all types of birds, according to the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
In 2002, Maryland's poultry industry ranked No. 7 nationally, according to 
Statistics Director Norman Bennett at the Maryland Agricultural Statistics 
Service. 
The Humane Society is supportive of the legislation. 
Wayne Pacelle, spokesman for the Humane Society, said, "People pit animals 
against one another. It's illegal in all 50 states, and a felony in 47 states."

In a third-grade class in Ardsley, students rarely bring in unhealthy snacks. 
"They don't want to have to argue with the snack monitor," says their 
teacher, Judy Behrens, who appoints a student inspector each day to judge whether the 
treats pass nutritional muster. 
In the Lakeland school district on the Westchester-Putnam border, 
elementary-school students used to be able to eat hot dogs for lunch every day. Now, the 
nitrate-laced entree is restricted to Mondays. For the rest of the week, 
students can dine on roast chicken, baked potatoes or Caesar salad with grilled 
chicken. Fourth-grader Kevin Reynoso said he's into healthly eating now "so I 
won't die quick" and because "I want to stay skinny for sports." 
The programs are part of a growing effort to quell the epidemic of childhood 
obesity and prevent the health problems it causes. 
Parents who have trouble enough dealing with meals at home worry about what 
their children are eating at school. Some are now working with teachers, 
dietitians and government officials to change school menus, instill lifelong habits 
and teach students to make "healthy choices" based on a balanced approach. The 
lessons begin in kindergarten. </docText>

A new rule from Clayton County Animal Control that is designed to raise more 
money is drawing fire from the local Humane Society and the Animal Control 
Advisory Board.

Animal Control recently instituted a new rule that representatives from 
rescue groups, like the Humane Society, must wait an additional two days to adopt a 
stray animal. Before, the groups could adopt the pets after three days, like 
any other member of the public. 

But rescue groups do not pay an adoption fee, and Animal Control was hoping 
to give the the public a chance to adopt the animal first, so it wouldn't miss 
out on collecting the fees.

Representatives of rescue groups, at the Animal Control Advisory Board 
meeting Monday night, took issue with the new rule.

"It made no sense to extend the period of time the animals are held," said 
Michelle Bryant, president of the Clayton County Humane Society.

Bryant said she worried about the health of animals in the care of Animal 
Control because of the shelter's level of cleanliness and its overcrowding. She 
said she witnessed workers sanitizing dog cages with bleach and not sanitizing 
water and food dishes when the dogs were moved.</docText>

It?s getting out of hand

A woman who called around lunchtime on Friday had so much to say that she was 
cut off by the Red Phone?s two-minute time limit. However, not to be 
deterred, she called back a little while later after ruminating more on the issue.

Her first call was prompted by a woman who last week wanted to give her ?two 
cents? worth? on the issue, and asked people not to judge all young people 
because of the bad behavior of a few.

?I think she needs to put more than that into it,? said Friday?s caller. ?
She needs to think more about what the Earth is like if people like her think 
only a little bit of damage can be done by a few.

?Most important, the killing of animals is wrong, it?s very wrong,? she said 
with conviction. ?A child cannot learn unless an adult shows them it?s wrong.
?

When she called back, it was more than an hour later, and it was obvious that 
this matter had been on her mind the whole time, as she asked, ?What will 
become of us humans??

She suggested that people visit animals at a shelter and ?look into their 
eyes.? 

?We need to make the world a better place to live in for us and animals,? 
she said. ?Atrocities can start with just one person.?</docText>

Stanford, a 16-pound shorthaired orange tabby, can't get enough food into his 
belly. 
"His Buddha belly is never full enough," said Manager Ann Marie Biegner 
describing Stanford's insatiable appetite. "He's kind of a character."
She described him as a "big old boy" who can be a bit of a grump if he 
doesn't get his way. 
His coat ranges in shades from a marmalade orange to a rust color. It's shiny 
and well kept even though he was found roaming around near South Road last 
week. 
Beigner couldn't tell if he had been abandoned or if he had been in a 
household that wasn't to his liking. 
She suspected that a new cat might have been brought into Stanford's home and 
he decided to find a new place where he could be "king of the roost."
Like most cats he would like his new family to make a fuss over him when he 
asks and to let him lounge at his leisure.
Stanford "likes to voice his opinion" to let everyone know exactly what he 
wants, especially when it's to fill an empty dish.
She says he should be good with people, but he may have a hard time adjusting 
to other animals. 
He is neutered and is negative for feline leukemia and AIDS.
Like Stanford, Squeeky, a 2- year-old brown tabby with a white chest and 
white paws, likes to eat.
Squeeky is less demanding than her friend Stanford, and was brought to the 
rescue league after her owner had to move to housing for the elderly and 
couldn't take Squeeky with her. 
Squeeky had just arrived at the pound last Wednesday so she was still getting 
used to her surroundings. She is an indoor cat who is good with everybody: 
people, cats, and dogs.</docText>

 Pet owners are happier than their non-pet owning counterparts according to 
new research from the not-for-profit mutual friendly society, Benenden 
Healthcare. The research which polled people in the UK, revealed that over half (55%) 
of pet owners are happy and that 71% do not feel stressed, in comparison to 
45% and 29% of non pet owners. 

The survey, which questioned respondents on a number of themes relating to 
pet ownership and wellbeing, also looked at whether owning a pet should be 
encouraged. Two thirds of respondents felt that it should be, with just 32% 
thinking that perhaps we are better off without animal companionship. 

The view of over half the people questioned (56%) was that pets are most 
beneficial for people over 50 that are heading towards retirement. Although many 
felt that animals can be of more benefit to the younger generation with 37% 
stating that children can profit most from owning a pet. 

Furthermore the survey results suggest that possessing a pet later in life 
can help to reduce loneliness in old age - over 97% of respondents were in 
agreement with this. However, in contrast, only 38% believed that owning a pet 
would speed up a person's recovery if they were ill. But when this percentage was 
split between the pet-owners and non pet owners, 77% of those in agreement 
owned animals. </docText>

        <docText>Humane officers seized 31 dogs from another unlicensed kennel 
owned by an area man accused in two states of operating puppy mills.


Three adult dogs and 15 puppies - Labrador retrievers and Weimariners - 
belonging to John Tanis were seized by Humane Officers Sandy Boysha and Tina Walter 
of the Lackawanna County Humane Society on Friday. The other dogs were seized 
by Chad Weaver of the Susquehanna County Humane Society and Pennsylvania 
State Dog Law wardens.
A condition of his bail from a previous case is that he isn't allowed to have 
more than two dogs, said Weaver. The dogs were outside without any shelter, 
and some didn't have any food or water, he added.
Tanis, who failed to appear for a Jan. 14 sentencing hearing on charges of 
animal neglect, is nowhere to be found and is considered a fugitive, said 
Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick.
Tanis called the Wyoming County sheriff last week and said he's out of the 
state and not coming back, said Skumanick. "He's showing contempt for the court 
and for the system by saying he's just not going to participate in the system 
unless it suits him"
Tanis' name has been turned in to a nationwide computer criminal registry. If 
he's caught, he could go to jail.</docText>

Is there a dog killer on the loose in Toronto? 
Police say they are still awaiting lab results from samples of food and snow 
taken from Withrow Park in the city's east end, but the head of the local dog 
owners' association believes poison was placed inside hot dogs in the park. 
Six dogs that had been in the park became seriously ill on the weekend and 
one dog died yesterday. 
In addition, two children from separate families who played in the park (at 
the ice rink and the toboggan hill) on the weekend became sick and parents 
reported this to police. However, Detective Sydney Thomas said today that the 
children may only have had the flu. 
"Neither one of them had to go to the hospital," he said, adding the families 
were dealing with the illnesses through their family doctors. 
"I don't want to start a panic about this," the detective said. 
The two children, both about 6 years old, showed symptoms similar to those of 
the sick dogs. An hour or so after visiting the park, they began vomiting and 
became very tired and lethargic. "That lasted approximately three to four 
hours," the detective said. 
"One became ill on Saturday and one became ill on Sunday." 
As well, 10 to 15 other dogs reportedly became sick after visiting the park 
on the weekend. 
Thomas wouldn't speculate on the cause of the illnesses today. All he would 
say is that the dogs all came into contact with a "foreign substance." 
"It is a concern to the community," he said. "Public safety is our biggest 
concern." 
The park remains closed. 
Thomas told a news conference this afternoon that there is a "remote 
possibility it is a deliberate act." 
"The idea that somebody could have done something like this deliberately 
reinforces a real need to inform and educate people about cruelty to animals," 
said Marilyn Churley, MPP for Toronto-Danforth. 
She called the situation "a distressing and frightening ordeal for members of 
the community." 
The five dogs that became seriously ill are expected to recover. 
A woman who runs a dog owners' group in Withrow Park is convinced there is a 
dog killer out there. </docText>

The laws are clear: wolf hybrids are illegal in Alaska. And that's got one 
wolf-dog headed for the border... literally. It's part of a deal worked out 
between the State and the animal's owners. 
Sasha is her name, and she's going from the canine equivalent of death row in 
Anchorage, to a sanctuary in Ontario Canada. 
Short of a DNA test, it's tough to tell how much pure wolf a dog's got in 
it's bloodline. So when Sasha got nabbed by officers in Anchorage, they had a 
perfect opportunity to test her. And it was a perfect opportunity to test the 
resolve of those who keep and breed the animals. 
The plan was to put the wolf-dog down, as a deterrent. But that's not what 
ended up happening. 
Sasha is saved. The 3 year old wolf hybrid who was caught after she broke out 
of her Anchorage pen has herself caught a break. Instead of being destroyed 
as scheduled, in a few days she will be shipped 3000 miles to an animal 
preserve in Ontario, Canada. 
"We've actually had more calls on this than the whole wolf/predator control 
thing," said Rick Sinott, a wildlife biologist for the State of Alaska. 
According to Sinnott, that level of public concern might go a long way to 
explaining Sasha's pardon. But Sinnott is quick to say this is the exception, not 
the rule.</docText>

Last week, a very sad but little known event took place in Orange. 

Orange lost its oldest bovine resident that I know of, or for that matter 
have ever treated. 



I returned from a conference in sunny Florida to a message from one of my 
cherished clients telling me that his 30-year-old cow Valentine (yes, I DID say 
30) was unable to get up. My heart sank. 

Two years ago, I received a similar call but we were able to get her up and 
get her on some aspirin boluses (giant cow pills) to help her with her 
arthritis. You could literally hear Valentine walk across the pasture as she creaked 
with arthritis and squeak as she chewed her cud with very worn teeth after so 
many years of use. We knew that for two years, she had been on borrowed time 
and now that time had probably come.

Big deal, you might say, if you are not an animal person. Thirty years and a 
cow at that. Let me tell you that Valentine's owners took care of her and 
loved her every bit as much as many of my clients love their dog, cat, goat, 
sheep, rabbit or what have you. 

I have looked into the welled up eyes of a little boy handing me his pet rat 
dying of congestive heart failure and a woman with her mixed breed dog 
(although we ALL thought Maude was truly a person in a little, feisty fur suit...) 
rescued from a shelter as an already very senior pet and now suffering from 
heart disease and cancer, and that man with his cow who had finally given up at 
the age of 30 and heard the same question " Is it time now?" with the same pain 
in their voices and hearts. Such a hard question to ask and answer, even 
having been on both sides of the fence.</docText>

A Flintville man faces animal cruelty charges stemming from the alleged 
starvation of a dog chained to a van, while another man has been sentenced to nine 
months in a separate animal starvation case. 
Dennis Ray Price, 34, of Brighton Road, admitted to being the owner of an 
emaciated male boxer that died on Dr. Mike Farrar's examining table just moments 
after animal shelter workers rushed the animal to the veterinarian for care 
late Tuesday afternoon.

"It had been laying on the ground unconscious, barely breathing, foaming at 
the mouth and was covered with mange," said Martha Richards, Humane Society 
member and Fayetteville Animal Shelter worker.

"We put him in the front seat and turned the heat on high - He was so cold," 
said Richards.

Moments after they arrived at Farrar's office, the dog's heart began beating 
erratically, and he died, officials said.

"It had been a long time since he had eaten, at least one to two months to 
lose that much body fat," said Farrar. 

The dog weighed less than 34 pounds, about half of what he should have 
weighed based on the size of his skeleton, the veterinarian said. With no food to 
produce body heat, no doghouse, a sparse coat due to the mange and heavy load of 
internal parasites, the dog had no defense against the cold. 

An anonymous tip had led shelter workers to the dog, but it was a day or two 
late. 

"If citizens would call before it's too late ... it's the only way the Humane 
Society can rescue the animals," Richards explained.

An unlikely coalition of anti-immigrant and animal-rights activists is
angling to elect several of its candidates to the Sierra Club's Board of
Directors. For the second time in less than a decade anti-immigration
advocates have been operating under the radar and waging a campaign to
take over the nation's oldest environmental organization.

The Club's 750,000 members will vote for five new members for its
15-person governing board in March and the first three weeks in April. If
the anti-immigration candidates prevail, the Los Angeles Times reported in
mid-January, they will control eight of the 15 seats and the Club's $95
million budget. The results will be made public sometime after April 21. 
...
Animal-rights supporters, which make up a smaller part of the alliance,
are looking for the Club to officially discourage hunting and fishing
despite the fact that nearly 20% of the membership engages in those
activities. They also want the Club to take a position against the
practice of raising animals for human consumption.
...
In a speech to the 2003 Animal Rights Conference in Los Angeles, Watson
explained his strategy: "I'm on the Sierra Club board of directors right
now ... to try and change it ... We're only three directors away from
controlling that board. We control one-third of it right now. And, once we
get three more directors elected ... we can use the resources of [its]
$95-million-a-year budget to address some of these issues. And the
heartening thing about it is that, in the last election, of the 750,000
members of the Sierra Club, only 8 percent of them voted. So, you know, a
few hundred, or a few thousand people from the animal rights movement
joining the Sierra Club ? and making it a point to vote ? will change the
entire agenda of that organization."

Two other SUSPS-supported candidates collected signatures on petitions and
are on the ballot. They are Kim McCoy, described by Groundswell Sierra as
a Club member and animal rights advocate from Chicago who is endorsed by
Watson, and Robert van de Hoek, a member from Los Angeles.

Anya Zartman jokes about becoming the Vegan Goddess of the area, 
but she is serious about being a vegan. 
The 25-year-old became a vegetarian when she was 11 years old. She switch to 
a vegan diet -- first and foremost for ethical reasons, she said. 
Zartman never had a school lunch from the sixth grade on. The transition was 
fairly easy, she said: "I just packed my lunch." 
Zartman didn't feel like an outsider, munching on vegetables while of the 
other kids were chomping down burgers. 
"In school everybody just kind of expected (that of) me," she said of her 
peers' perception of her. "Oh that's Anya," she said -- she was kind of outspoken 
and political anyway. 
Plus, both of her parents were very receptive to her being a vegetarian. 
She began to embrace the existence more throughout high school and college as 
she read about the impact of vegetarianism on health and the environment. 
She learned the encompassed much more than health. 
Connecting with other vegans has been a plus of being on a college campus. </docText>

The security firm Securicor has announced it will not renew its contract with 
Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) because of on going protests by animal rights 
activists. The company, which has guarded the gates at HLS for three or four 
years, has seen its regional offices and management become the target of animal 
rights activists in recent weeks. 
It is a double blow for bosses after HLS parted company with another security 
firm, ADT, which was subjected to demonstrations outside its offices. 
HLS chief executive Brian Cass denounced the decision saying protests against 
the business have involved, 'a few ladies with placards and a bit of noise'. 
Caroline Bailey of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) said: "This is a 
victory for SHAC. Any firm which does business with HLS can expect to be targeted 
by us. As far as we are concerned, they deserve everything they get." And she 
warned the promise not to renew links with HLS will not save Securicor in the 
short-term. Bailey said: "Our campaign will continue as long as they are 
guarding the gates." And in fact several activists got together and decided to pay 
a visit to Securicor yesterday. Delighted at the news that they were going to 
sever the contract with HLS, they went to ask if they would bring the date 
forward and terminate all involvement with the company immediately. 
HLS, which tests drugs and chemicals on dogs and other mammals, has had a 
number of associated companies terminate contracts after sustained pressure from 
an organization called SHAC, which stands for Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty. 
Last March, Deloitte &amp; Touche quit as auditors for the business, and the 
company has moved its listing to the US to prevent intimidation of its 
shareholders. The company was at one point also forced to use the Bank of England as a 
"lender of last resort" after other businesses pulled banking facilities from </docText>

        <docText>Applause greeted the happy news announced Wednesday to Deschutes 
County commissioners: The Humane Society of Central Oregon has reached its $1 
million fund-raising goal and is about to start construction of a new, 
greatly enlarged shelter for lost, abandoned and abused dogs and cats, replacing its 
cramped, 27-year-old facility.

Kittens and puppies don?t really know how to applaud, of course. But they 
would if they could, since it's their fate and future that will be much more 
hopeful, once the new shelter is completed late this year. 

The city last fall approved the site plan for the $2.4 million shelter, to be 
built beside the current facility on county-donated land along Southeast 27th 
Street, south of the Knott Landfill. Site preparation is expected to begin 
soon, and groundbreaking for the 15,000-square-foot shelter ? nearly three times 
the current size ? is planned in March, said Nancy Stewart, president of the 
humane society (www.hsco.org) board. </docText>

Two kinds of ships cast lines and nets into Antarctic waters ? those fishing 
for cash and those trawling for answers. 

Over the last decade, legal and illegal fishing fleets have come farther 
south into Antarctic waters, filling their holds with krill, Patagonian toothfish 
and mackerel icefish. Researchers sample the same seas, trying to understand 
the marine resources in order to protect them from overfishing. 

?If you?re going to make intelligent judgments about how much is too much in 
fishing management, you need to know what?s going on,? said Dan Evans, a 
seabird researcher with the National Science Foundation supported Long Term 
Ecological Research project at Palmer Station. 

For both fishermen and scientists, the stakes are high. The payoff for a 
metric ton of Patagonian toothfish is about $7,000, but in certain areas where 
pirate fishermen are taking fish without regard for the regulations, scientists 
have cautioned that toothfish could be decimated in a few years, along with 
many seabirds. In the Prince Edward Islands south of South Africa, intensive 
illegal fishing for toothfish has already depleted the population to a few percent 
of its pre-exploitation level, according to research published by the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Other 
CCAMLR research found the toothfish population around Heard Island has also 
dropped since 1998. </docText>

I read through the Jan. 8 edition of The Muse, and came across the opinion
piece about the virtue of soy. I have several vegan/vegetarian/dabbler
friends who raise many of these points and who argue with some of my more
carnivorous friends about this subject.

At first, I thought it was a lovely rebuttal to some points I've heard
before, even though I never read the previous piece it referred to. Ms.
Whitehead raised many valid points about the ecological effects of herd
farming, the physiological effects of eating meat, and I'll even agree
that she had a point about the psychological effect of eating a
potentially sentient creature, even though my personal beliefs disagree
with her on the last two points. 
...
The best idea for getting rid of excess animals would be to eat them at
our regular pace, but stop them from reproducing. By eating them, they are
still worth supporting and by reducing the numbers of cattle, the price of
meat will rise as rarity increases, forcing people to find meat
alternatives. Eventually, meat would be a rare luxury to be phased out by
the rich, socially enlightened people who thought it was a bad idea to eat
meat in the first place.

The problem, of course, is getting existing cattle ranchers to co-operate,
which is rather unlikely as they are turning a profit with their current
plan of making burgers.

So my conclusion is this: it?s too late to stop eating meat. We?ve bent
the lives of animals to our needs for thousands of years, and now they are
ours, like it or not. Do we dare to try and free the animals of ourselves?

        <docText>he 53-foot trailer shook as the 20 mares inside whinnied and 
stomped, restless and nervous after two days of captivity. Outside the trailer, 
horse lovers peered through the slats in the truck, eager to identify their 
mare.

With a make-shift ramp in place, the back of the trailer noisily creaked in 
the morning stillness as the first frightened-looking mares stepped out. 
"They're like mail-order brides," said Nancy Riegler as she looked for the 
horse she recently adopted off the Internet. "I have looked at her picture so 
many times online that as soon as the truck pulled up and I caught a glimpse of 
her blaze, I knew it was her."

The horses, most of them pregnant, had just traveled 1,800 miles from 
Alberta, Canada, to a ranch in Ramona, the Southern California headquarters of 
FoalQuest.

The mares had all come from farms that supply urine from pregnant mares to 
Wyeth Pharmaceutical, which uses it to manufacture the hormone replacement 
therapy, Premarin.

Since 1999, the nonprofit FoalQuest organization has rescued and found homes 
for foals born to the mares. In October, the group also began finding homes 
for the mares when demand for Premarin dropped and the farms were forced to 
reduce their horse population by 40 percent. About 450 farms in western Canada and 
North Dakota keep as many as 40,000 horses for their urine production.

There will be plenty of horsing around this weekend at Sebastian 
Municipal Airport. 
Sarasota's Walker Bros. Circus is expected to set up its acts on the 
airport's south infield this morning for 5:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. shows today and 
Saturday, said Sebastian Vice Mayor Ray Coniglio. 
He said entertainment will include acrobats, clowns, illusionists and show 
horses. 
Officials from the nonprofit Boys and Girls Club of Indian River County have 
an agreement with the circus to provide the shows. Club officials hope to get 
about $3,000 from circus proceeds to help pay operational expenses at their 
temporary Sebastian clubhouse, 250 County Road 512. 
Coniglio chairs the Sebastian club's 12-member advisory board and had 
suggested a circus fund-raiser. 
Last month, he and other members of the City Council decided elephants and 
caged animals, such as tigers, would not be allowed to perform in the shows. 
Council members were acting on the concerns of some local animal lovers, who 
cited reported abuse of circus animals. </docText>

The independent inquiry found that Hall had seriously deviated from commonly 
accepted scientific practices. A similar finding was made in allegation three 
that the committee considered, yet no mention was made of this by the 
vice-chancellor.
Nor does he mention allegation five, which actually emerged during the course 
of the inquiry. While the inquiry made no adverse finding, the members 
uncovered damaging information - major problems with the way Hall changed his 
interpretation of data to suit different circumstances. This occurred in a paper and 
an abstract and it concerns the definition of rejection. In one situation in 
defending the findings of an abstract to a conference, Hall interprets the 
results from a group of rats as rejection but, in another situation, a paper 
submitted for publication, he interprets the same data from the same rats as 
tolerance, not rejection.
In relation to the other allegations concerning missing data and the alleged 
misrepresentation of data and statistics in a grant application to the NHMRC, 
the Brennan inquiry found Hall had committed a significant falsehood, had 
acted with reckless disregard for the truth or with intent to deceive. Hume 
partially disagreed with the inquiry, relying on reasons which were very similar to 
the explanations given by Hall to the inquiry.</docText>

Thank God for PETA.

Before you madly search your home for tar and feathers, I am not a
card-carrying PETA member. Nor do I concur with many of the group's
"extremist" views or tactics. PETA's 2003 exhibit comparing factory farm
animals to Holocaust victims, for example, was a bad idea.

That said, however, I still thank God for PETA -- short for People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals.

The PETA folks have riled up more than a few ranchers and trappers,
infuriated many a meat eater and hunter, and prompted outrage from Bible
fundamentalists and game farm proprietors. They have crawled under the
skin of those people who feel animals were put on this planet merely for
human exploitation.

That's what they want to do. But PETA also does something else that hardly
any other group does with any regularity:

It stands up for those that can't speak for themselves. It sticks its neck
out. It takes chances. It displays a great deal of mettle for a cause it
profoundly believes in.
...
Thanks to PETA, McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Wendy's have all
inaugurated animal welfare research programs. PETA also has been in the
trenches in the battles against dogfighting and cockfighting.
...
The commercial was a bit risqu?, perhaps, but humorous and fairly tame
when compared to the Super Bowl's halftime show and some of the other
lackluster commercial spots. The gist of PETA's ad was that eating meat
causes impotence. (You can view the 30-second ad at
www.peta.org/feat/superbowl/.)
...
Subtly and slowly, but surely and assuredly, PETA is changing the American
consciousness. At times, change is imperceptible.

We may view PETA's actions as outrageous and radical, hardly giving them a
second thought.

But I can't help but ponder: A decade or two down the road, might we
wonder what took us so long to understand?</docText>

Hi. My name is Subject No. 54879 and I live in an animal research lab. 
Although I'm usually a pretty calm mouse - being as I'm nearly always despondent due 
to various experimental drugs - I feel compelled to write in defense of 
animal research. It's about time we get some old-fashioned RESPECT. 
Researchers have long been criticized by organizations like People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals for using furry creatures as test subjects. I can 
recall more than one occasion when I was rudely awakened, not by severe 
cramping following bleach-laced pellets, but by loud protesters just below my window. 
Sometimes these protests last all night; they should be grateful my eyes were 
swollen with hair spray and I couldn't sleep anyway. Otherwise, you can be 
sure they would have been hearing from me. This mouse does not put up with that 
sort of foolishness. No, siree! 
What is most aggravating is that protesters just don't seem to understand 
that animal testing is an honored and effective tradition. Wise up, people! If 
not for brave subjects such as myself, mankind would not be able to enjoy the 
vaccinations, pesticides, artificial sweeteners and cosmetics they do now. And 
forget about moisturized skin, too; that was the result of Granny, No. 37954, 
and the rest of her proud generation. 
When protesters label this as "inhumane" and "brutal," they're spitting on 
the selfless mammals that have contributed to the luxuries humans enjoy daily. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted by their brazen ingratitude and it's time I speak out. </docText>

It's a horror picture often alluded to in children's movies like Babe or 
Charlotte's Web; thousands of animals crowded inside a dirty slaughterhouse. But 
factory farms are more than just a scene from a movie; they are a growing 
reality across our country. 
In a recent resolution, the American Public Health Association (APHA) has 
called for help from government organizations in putting a moratorium on new 
factory farms. 
They also propose funding to encourage research that examines the effect of 
factory farms on the environment and its workers. 
Factory farms, technically called Concentrated Animal Food Operations 
(CAFOs), have been thought to be responsible for a variety of problems in not only 
their surrounding environment but also in the health of livestock and safety of 
food production across the country. Approximately 54 percent of U.S. livestock 
is currently estimated to be concentrated on only 5 percent of livestock 
farms. 
The center at Johns Hopkins which examines problems such as those caused by 
factory farms is the Center for a Livable Future (CLF), located at the Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
Robert Lawrence, director of the CLF, explains its history and goals. "The 
Center for a Livable Future was created seven years ago," he says. Its purpose 
is "to explore the connections between diet and human health, between diet and 
food production system, between the industrialization of food production and 
the environment, and between the degradation of the environment and hazards to 
human health." 
A CAFO is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
as a farm with more than a certain number of animals. 
For instance, more than 1,000 beef cattle would put a farm in the category of 
a CAFO. </docText>

10 People Face Total Of 88 Charges
POSTED: 11:11 AM EST February 5, 2004
Six people were arrested in and around Baker County Thursday morning, and the 
Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission has warrants for four others 
in connection with numerous crimes against wildlife. 
Two of the suspects -- both women -- were also charged with selling 
moonshine. 
The arrest warrants were issued after an the undercover investigation into 
the illegal sale of fish and wildlife by FWC officers posing as local hunters 
and fishermen. 
"The sale of game animals and fish is illegal," FWC Maj. Gary Strickland said 
in a statement. "There is no commercial harvest of these recreational 
resources. If this was allowed, it could deplete our natural resources that FWC is 
working to preserve for our recreational users." 
Florida Alcohol, Beverage and Tobacco agents were brought into the 
investigation after undercover officers reported several purchases of illegal moonshine 
whiskey during the investigation. 
The majority of the charges are fish and wildlife cases, totaling 67 first- 
and second-degree misdemeanors and 21 felonies. </docText>

At first glance there doesn't seem to be anything out of place about
Calendula, a new, upscale natural food restaurant along Southeast
Hawthorne Boulevard. With its tasteful gray and blue paint scheme, the
1891 house-turned-eatery blends in with the nearby art galleries and
natural-fiber clothes shops in the bohemian neighborhood.

Business has been brisk since the restaurant opened Jan. 19. On a recent
evening, formally dressed waiters slip between the small tables covered
with white tablecloths, taking orders and refilling water glasses.

Customers are dining on mushroom-leek lasagna, kale and winter squash
phyllo purse and other gourmet vegetarian dishes, lingering over sweet
desserts and espresso drinks.

To some, however, there is definitely something odd about the restaurant's
owner. Craig Rosebraugh is a local political activist who has spent much
of the past 10 years railing against the evils of capitalism. For much of
the 1990s, the Portland area native served as press spokesman for the
Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front, two underground
groups that have been accused by the federal government of committing acts
of domestic terrorism.

Although Rosebraugh has never been charged with any terrorism-related
crimes, federal law enforcement agents have served search warrants on his
home, and he has been subpoenaed before federal grand juries investigating
acts of ecoterrorism.

More recently, Rosebraugh, 31, wrote and published a book, "The Logic of
Political Violence," that justifies domestic terrorism as necessary to
bring about a long-overdue second American Revolution.

"I'm all for peaceful civil disobedience if it works. But if it doesn't,
people need to take more drastic steps until they achieve their goals,"
Rosebraugh writes.</docText>

Whether you consider Jumpy fortunate or oppressed is a good barometer of
where you come down on the general animal rights debate. Most people,
secure in their personhood and assured of the value of humanity, are
willing to use animals for human purposes -- to eat meat, wear leather,
and keep pets.

Yet a small but very vocal minority tries to mask a sneering disregard for
humanity with a concern for animals so extreme it would look exaggerated
in a silent movie. Accompanying this disdain for people is a
self-righteous delusion that they alone are saving the planet with their
steady diet of self-denial. They believe each time you eat a soy burger,
Earth gives you a big, grinning thumbs-up.
...
Self-denying environmentally conscious eaters stress how much impact their
personal consumption decisions make, but for each tread-lightly vegetarian
in the United States there are a thousand Asians who?d dice the last whale
on Earth into cubes and eat it on vinegared rice with great pleasure and
without a second thought.
...
The truth is that nearly every cow alive owes its existence to either the
meat or the dairy industry, and that should the fad of vegetarianism ever
really affect those businesses, animal lives would be lost, not gained.

Sunday: On that note, the next day I brave McDonald?s, the belly of the
beast for the cow-hugging set. They hate McDonald?s because it grinds up
more beef than any other enterprise, and because its heinous, grossly
American model of mechanized cow slaughter is so successfully spreading
all across the globe. 
...
Organic food is a luxury, another bit of rich American conspicuous
consumption. And while eating organic has some impact, I?m sure, that
impact is dwarfed by the colossal self-righteousness of its practitioners.

February 2004 issue - Back in 1997, investigative journalists Sheldon
Rampton and John Stauber wrote a book called Mad Cow U.S.A.: Could the
Nightmare Happen Here? Their answer was a resounding--and prescient--yes.
They based their certitude on the fact that the meat industry held
inordinate sway over the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which was
supposed to be ensuring the safety of the meat supply.

One of the first USDA task forces on Mad Cow disease in 1990 consisted,
among others, of "key representatives from the agribusiness industry,"
Rampton and Stauber wrote. The National Milk Producers Federation, the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Sheep Industry
Association, and the National Renderers Association were all on board.
There was "not even token representation by a consumer organization," the
authors wrote.
...
Consumers Union noted that even today "rendered cattle remains can be fed
to swine and chickens, and that rendered swine and chicken remains can, in
turn, be fed back to cattle."

Stauber has a simple solution. "The feed rules that the United States must
adopt can be summarized this way: You might not be a vegetarian, but the
animals you eat must be," he wrote.

But the meat industry, still hidebound, stuck to its guns. "One of our
philosophies is minimal government involvement and letting the industry
address these things," Terry Stokes, the head of the cattlemen's
association, told The New York Times on January 1.

For its part, the American Meat Institute denied there were any health
concerns. "This case poses no risk to consumers," said J. Patrick Boyle,
president of that organization.
...
Just three weeks before the first confirmed Mad Cow case in the United
States and more than two years after the corporate scandals erupted, Bush
was still blaming the government for getting in the way of business.
Speaking at an event at a Home Depot in Baltimore, Bush said that
"excessive regulations" hurt all businesses, and he vowed to ease up.

But as the case of Mad Cow shows, regulation is not a problem; the lack of
regulation is. A policy beholden to corporate interests has resulted in a 

How many Mad Cows is it going to take to change that philosophy?</docText>

        <docText>For nine years, Mark McCarthy and his team of volunteers took 
care of Natasha, a rare snow leopard with respiratory problems.
But two weeks ago, the roughly $3,500 annual cost to treat the cat's illness 
proved too high for the nonprofit McCarthy's Wildlife Sanctuary in The 
Acreage. 
"This medication wasn't working," said McCarthy, the director. "If I had the 
money, I probably wouldn't have put her down. I could've tried to get some 
type of other medication. She's extremely rare, very beautiful and it's very sad 
it had to come to that." 
Faced with increasing costs for expenses such as insurance and food, McCarthy 
is worried his budget will force him to lose more of the native and exotic 
big cats, birds and reptiles he supports and rehabilitates.
For 14 years, the work was largely paid for with fees from doing educational 
programs at schools, clubs and birthday parties. McCarthy has received some 
help from foundations, but he faces stiff competition for grants from larger 
sanctuaries backed by big companies, like the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary in 
Jupiter, founded by Peter Busch of the Anheuser-Busch family.</docText>

When members of the World Society for the Protection of Animals say they'll 
go halfway around the globe to help animals, they really mean it. 

     Since last year, the worldwide agency, whose U.S. office is in 
Framingham, has been working with GIs serving in Iraq, their families and the military 
to bring home stray dogs befriended by the troops. 

     Stray dogs are a common sight on Iraqi streets, where the animals are 
often used as working animals, like guard dogs, but seem to be rarely kept as 
companions. 

     "There are a lot of stray dogs in Iraq," WSPA's USA Director Laura 
Salter said. "The Iraqi culture is not one in which there's a strong fondness for 
dogs. There seems to be a widespread fear of catching disease from dogs. 

     "What we understand is that the majority simply (wander the) road, 
scavenging, looking for something to eat." 

     For soldiers like Army Staff Sgt. Jason Cowart of Fort Hood, Texas, the 
sight of the starving animals was impossible to ignore. 

     Using military rations, Cowart drew one scrawny puppy from under a 
Dumpster and managed to befriend the animal. Eventually named Ratchet, the dog rode 
next to Cowart in the front seat of a Humvee throughout the war. </docText>

A Bronx tot was mauled yesterday when her pet pit bull snapped and tore into 
her cheeks, police and witnesses said. 
Makailah Barnett, 3, nearly had the side of her face ripped off after a pooch 
named Pepper attacked her and her sister as they played in the house with the 
family's two other dogs. 
"The dog just lost her mind," said the girl's uncle Corey Bellamy, who ran 
across the street when he heard screams. "The dog wigged out." 
Little Makailah was in serious condition last night at Montefiore Medical 
Center, where she was undergoing facial reconstructive surgery. Her 4-year-old 
sister, Isianay, was treated at the hospital for bites to the head and released. 
Emergency Service Unit cops had to fire tranquilizer darts at the pack of 
dogs, which also included a pit bull named Lucky and a German shepherd puppy 
named Bear. They were all taken to the city's animal control center. 
"They're not vicious dogs," Bellamy insisted. "They're friendly." 
Police said Pepper was anything but friendly when she attacked the girls in 
the family's W. 184th St. home just after 2 p.m.

        <docText> It?s been quiet at the Johnsons? house since the babies 
left home. 
No joyful noises or petty squabbles, no clamoring for attention, no climbing 
into bed with their parents, no patter of furry little feet. 
The Bureau of Animal Control took the Johnsons? 96 cats almost two weeks ago. 
A judge ruled Wednesday that the couple, while well-intentioned, can?t 
adequately care for them. 
Their lawyer has appealed the ruling, and Animal Control is holding the cats. 
Meanwhile, Linda Johnson is beside herself. 
?I know every hair on their heads,? she said Thursday, as she wandered 
through her empty home. 
Linda and Larry Johnson married in 1977, and the cats followed soon after. 
The Johnsons were living in Timberlake when they found their first cats: a 
mother and her two kittens in their woodpile. 
Soon after, the couple began pulling cats from dumpsters and abandoned 
houses, saving them from highway medians and construction sites. 
Word spread and people began bringing them strays or dropping off unwanted 
pets when they moved. The Johnsons took them all, no questions asked. They were 
hooked. 
?A cat is a furball that encases love,? Larry Johnson said. ?You?ve got to 
learn cat language. They do speak to you.? 
The couple continued collecting cats when they moved to their Bellamy Manor 
home off Providence Road. They started holding cats for pet lovers who were 
temporarily unable to keep them. </docText>

AMES, Iowa - The temperature has dropped to 4 below, and the vast campus
of Iowa State University is a snowy, sullen ghost town. Professors and
students alike are away on winter break. It is not a promising time or
place to drum up votes.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich doesn't seem to notice, or care. Arriving late, a
two-aide entourage in support, the little-known Democrat from Ohio starts
firing away the moment he hits the overheated basement meeting room of the
Collegiate United Methodist Church.

"This campaign has picked up a lot of momentum!" he declares
enthusiastically to the crowd of about 85.

Kucinich then lists the particulars of what he calls his "holistic world
view." If he were president, he says, he would replace U.S. troops in Iraq
with U.N. troops, within 90 days of taking office, and pay reparations to
Iraqi families.

He would cut the Defense Department's budget by 15 percent and establish a
Department of Peace. He would repeal the North American Free Trade
Agreement and withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization.
...
Yet, among those who gather to hear him, Kucinich inspires enormous
enthusiasm. He attracts the true believers who were devoted to Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, but are looking for an alternative within
the Democratic Party.

In Kucinich, a vehement opponent of the war in Iraq, a critic of the
mainstream media, and a fervent advocate of free education, single-payer
health care, workers' rights, environmental protections, and legalized
marijuana, they have him. The man is even a vegan.
...
He worked as a TV reporter, a radio talk show host and a lecturer. In
1982, his income totaled $38. Along the way, two marriages failed. He
became a vegan, eating a diet free of animal products.</docText>

        <docText>he Zoning Board of Adjustment granted a use variance 
Thursday to Animal Outreach of Cape May County, a nonprofit group planning to build 
a shelter off Bayshore Road.

The shelter is slated for a 3.5-acre site on the west side of Bayshore Road 
near Fishing Creek Road, an area between the North Cape May and Villas sections 
of the township.

After hearing testimony that steps will be taken to limit noise, smells and 
other problems often associated with animal shelters, and that the facility 
will be located toward the center of the property, the board voted 6-0 to grant 
the variance.

About 30 animal advocates at the meeting, many who work as volunteers for the 
nonprofit organization that last ran a shelter a few years ago on the banks 
of the Cape May Canal, cheered after the board vote. No neighbors spoke against 
the variance, and if there had been opposition, Animal Outreach could have 
postponed the vote until the full, seven-member board was in attendance. Five 
votes were needed for the use variance.

The variance is required to run a shelter in a general business zone. Local 
site-plan approval is still needed, and state approvals may be necessary 
because there are wetlands on the property. Cape May County's approval of wastewater 
treatment plans may also be needed, although Animal Outreach President Ellen 
Shaw hopes the facility can be connected to the Lower Township Municipal 
Utilities Authority, so septic system approval will not be needed.</docText>

Green-and-white "Trees Grow Jobs!" signs along those roads underscore how 
important agriculture is here, where cotton, peanut and timber farming have been 
the economic mainstay for generations.
 
Agriculture still drives the economy of Fort Gaines, Clay County and the 
region.
 
But some farmers here say profits are withering as they confront ever-rising 
land taxes and equipment costs, while global food competition keeps crop 
prices stagnant.
 
It's time, they say, to look beyond crops as a source of income.
 
"The farmer has gotten to the point where you can still make money, but you 
have to stretch to cover all your costs," said Dan Giles, who raises cattle and 
grows cotton, corn and peanuts on the 4,500 acres he farms in Clay County.</docText>

There's an old saying to the effect that you can't tell a book by its cover.

But the saying isn't really about books; it's about people. Supposedly a
person's outward appearance doesn't tell you anything about what they're
like within.

The cormorant's ways are as ugly as its looks. It's a voracious fish
predator, which was no great problem when cormorant numbers were low. But
for some reason over the last 20 years or so the cormorant population has
exploded, and they have wreaked havoc on fish farms and some say upon
sport fisheries as well.
...
Some fish farmers have even been granted authorization to shoot cormorants
preying on the fish in their ponds.

But with the mechanics finally in place to restore some measure of balance
to the cormorant population, four animal-rights groups have filed suit to
strike down the much-needed measures. The plaintiff organizations are the
Fund for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, the Defenders
of Wildlife and the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida.

I don't know any animal-rights wackos nor do I have any wish to. I
suspect, though, that they're an exception to the rule that people's
natures often match their looks. If the appearance of the animal-righters
reflected the daffiness of their thought processes, they'd all be
dead-ringers for Howdy-Doody.

        <docText>Ollie Seaman, 34, walked across the rows of belly-high metal
shelters on his farm, each topped by a rooster -- a kelso, a hatch, a
roundhead, a claret and dozens of combinations -- all of them the product
of 16 years of breeding and selection.

He handles the bird breeding on his five-acre place, he said, and lets
cockfighting do the selecting.
...
Always a few die, crumpled on the floors of the cock pits that are hidden
in barns, buildings and back yards.

But it's not those 15 or 20 dead roosters that Seaman wants to talk about.
It's the champions, the ones that prevail.

"If they win anywhere from two to six fights, if I like what I see them do
in the pit, I make them a brood cock and they never fight again," Seaman
said, pointing to the line of 15-by-15-foot wire-and-wood rooms nestled in
the back corner of his farm, each a home to one strutting, battle-proven

Owning a cock pit in Alabama is a misdemeanor that can bring a fine of $20
to $50, but there's no law against raising the fighting birds, attending
fights or entering competitors in them.
...
Cockfighting is legal in Louisiana and New Mexico and illegal in the other
48 states. The Humane Society of the United States, which describes
Alabama's law as "the weakest in the nation," last week called on the
state's legislators to outlaw cockfight attendance and impose fines for
possession of cockfight paraphernalia.

Alabama's present cockfighting statute allows a largely underground
industry to flourish, said Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the
Humane Society. </docText>

        <docText>Concern for the welfare of dogs sold at auction is behind a call for 
legislative study that could bring new laws against animal abuse.
"I just think there ought to be some kind of standards and regulations if 
you're going to do this, to make sure that animals are humanely treated, make 
sure that they have adequate food and water and space," said Rep. Vaneta Becker, 
R-Evansville.
Her concern stems from a November dog auction in Odon, where irate dog lovers 
found abused animals in poor health.
When the legislature convenes Monday, Becker will ask for an inquiry into 
such auctions. If adopted, her resolution could lead to protective legislation in 
2005.
Animal advocates are grateful, but they fear the initiative won't go far in 
fighting abuse unless it extends to breeders who use the auctions to unload 
sick, surplus and problematic dogs on unwitting or uncaring buyers.</docText>

        <docText>Officials with the US Department of Agriculture are calling for construction 
of a $100 million animal disease research laboratory in Laramie. 
If approved, the new 178,000-square-foot national facility would replace the 
two existing USDA Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Laboratories 
located in West Laramie and at the University of Wyoming. 
Although it?s still waiting for Congress? approval, the possible expansion 
could mean over 30 new jobs and a $10 million economic impact for Laramie. 
?The community has a lot to gain economically by having a facility like this 
built here,? said Richard Mayer, a research leader with the Laramie 
laboratory. 
Mayer is gathering letters of support and cooperative agreements from several 
state and regional groups, with the hope Congress will fund the lab this 
year. 
The potential project has also been endorsed by the National Cattlemen?s 
Association, Wyoming Stockgrowers Association and the US Animal Health 
Association. 
?I don?t see anything negative about bringing something like this here,? 
Mayer said. ?It would attract new businesses to Laramie and the University of 
Wyoming would be more competitive for grant money.? 
The Laramie lab specializes in livestock diseases caused by insects, such as 
ticks, mosquitoes and biting midges. It cooperates with other universities, 
vaccine-development corporations and the cattle industry.</docText>

Animal control Officer James Lobdell reached into a cage at the 
county's shelter to pet a mixed lab, whose ribs are showing from malnutrition.
"How are you doing, girl?" Lobdell asked. 
The skinny dog was neglected by her owner, then abandoned.
Ingham County Animal Control Shelter took 956 complaints in January - ranging 
from animal welfare concerns to bites.
That's more than double the 466 complaints it received in January last year. 
"What I've seen a lot this winter is people are exposing their animals to the 
cold weather," said Mari Nicol, the shelter's veterinarian. "Especially with 
outside dogs. People just don't have properly insulated shelter for them."
With just six days registering above freezing last month, it's been a harsher 
winter than usual for dogs and cats.</docText>

It's not hard to spot some pampered pets. They sport jaunty plaid coats or 
elaborate rainbow harnesses, or wear hats that match their owners. They are 
spoken to only in baby talk, and get their nails done more often than the crew of 
"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"

But for every Shitzu in a beanie, there are hundreds of other coddled 
creatures who live in the lap of luxury, though they remain unseen and unsung. Their 
owners spend thousands of dollars a year on pet supplies to keep their 
"babies" in fine things, but don't necessarily think of themselves as excessive. 
In fact, many of them don't fit the stereotype of the socialite with her pug 
in a Prada bag. They are our friends and neighbors, coworkers and our family 
members. They are also the proud parents of truly pampered pets.

According to a 2003-04 survey conducted by the American Pet Products 
Manufacturers Association, 62 percent of Americans are pet owners, and they spent $31 
billion dollars last year on pet care, not including medical care. One out of 
three households has at least one dog or cat, and one-third of small animal 
owners consider their pets to be children or family members.

Terri Nicholas of Corvallis didn't always own a menagerie. It really happened 
to her slowly. Her children were grown and had moved out, and were making 
families of their own. The house was a little empty. So Bailey the ferret moved 
in.

Nicholas learned to love ferrets when her daughter was living at home, and 
when daughter and ferret moved out, she decided to get one of her own. Bailey 
was the first, and six years later is the beloved eldest pet, but she certainly 
wasn't the last.

Camille was a pregnant, ill stray cat who wandered into Nicholas' life one 
rainy Christmas Eve. It took a lot of medical care to get Camille into good 
health and spirits, but she's now the queen of Nicholas' household.</docText>

The biotechnology industry has called on President George W. Bush to help 
combat "a growing wave of terrorist" violence from animal rights activists. 

In a letter to President Bush, Biotechnology Industry Organization President 
Carl Feldbaum highlighted the industry's concerns over the changing tenor of 
animal rights activism and called for government action. 
"Animal rights terrorists have engaged in bombings of research facilities, 
harassment of the children of biotech executives in their schools, and vandalism 
of personal property," wrote Feldbaum. "Their campaign against biotechnology 
companies is strategic, specific, unrelenting and directed toward delivering 
economic, and sometimes physical, damage to companies engaged in innovation for 
life-threatening diseases such as cancer and cystic fibrosis." 
In August, Emeryville-based Chiron Corp. was the target of two bomb blasts. A 
month later, Pleasanton-based Shaklee Inc. was the victim of a third. No one 
was injured in the attacks, and there was only minor damage to property. 
Chiron and Shaklee's parent, the Japan-based Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 
have both in the past contracted for animal testing with Huntingdon Life 
Sciences, the subject of an ongoing campaign by animal rights activists hoping to 
drive it out of business. </docText>

Feb 08: 
IF your instincts are clucking with concern, and you're wondering why pigs 
are in the headlines with flu-stricken chickens, you're right, it is bad news.

The cutting-edge science on the front-pages is ringing alarm bells.

At the core of the commotion is this worst-case scenario: avian flu virus 
picked up by pigs can swap genetic materials with another flu virus already in 
the pig and become a new, hitherto unknown flu virus for which no person, no 
animal has preexisting immunity.

The kind of virus that causes a pandemic because it spreads from human to 
human.

But make no mistake, the pig is not the villain, neither is the chicken.

It's actually us. And our horrible farm practices, outdated agricultural 
policy and, most of all, reckless disregard of our ecology and environment. It's 
merely a phenomenon of nature that the pig is the "mixing vessel" for the new 
germ.

What we may have done is unwittingly create the perfect launch pad for an 
influenza pandemic that will likely kill large numbers of people across the globe.

Although scientists say it's impossible to predict the odds that the virus 
will alter its genetic form radically enough to start leaping from human to 
human, the longer H5N1 is out there killing chickens, the higher the chances are.

        <docText>Amanda Moeckel remembers standing in the Lunenburg High School 
cafeteria nine years ago campaigning for animal rights. 
Now Moeckel, 24, is among 10 female finalists vying to be "The Sexiest 
Vegetarian Alive." 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has given national 
attention to the Lunenburg native, picking her from hundreds of vegetarian 
contestants. 
"It's kind of tongue-in-cheek humor to get people into vegetarianism. ... To 
get media in this country, sometimes you have to do crazy, insane stuff," 
Moeckel said from her home in San Francisco. "I like to talk about vegetarianism 
as much as I can. It's a more compassionate lifestyle." 
Moeckel admits she doesn't agree with everything PETA has done for publicity, 
but she is grateful for the work they do. 
PETA is a national animal rights group that has drawn national attention 
through a number of controversial protests aimed at people wearing fur. 
The animal group claims vegetarians are "healthier and sexier" than 
meat-eaters. 
Since leaving Lunenburg after high school graduation, Moeckel has started her 
own art business, primarily painting animal portraits and animal advocacy 
materials. 
Her art has appeared in "The Animal's Agenda" and "The Abolitionist." 
Moeckel stopped eating meat in high school after reading "Animal Liberation," 
which contains graphic accounts of animal testing and slaughtering. 
"I've always been an animal lover, but I never really questioned what went on 
in factory farms. When I read the book, I realized how bad the conditions 
were for the animals," she said. "It's so hard to stomach. ... I decided to stop 
supporting animal suffering myself."</docText>

        <docText>Sweeping new powers against animal rights activists are being prepared by
the Home Office. New legislation would make it an imprisonable offence to
intimidate scientists involved in animal research, and prevent large groups
gathering outside laboratories. A national police unit dedicated to tackling
animal terrorism could be set up.
The decision follows last week's announcement that Cambridge University has
abandoned construction of its proposed Primate Research Centre. The
laboratory, where scientists would have carried out research on Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's and other brain diseases, was ditched because of the costs of
protecting buildings and staff from people protesting about the use of
primates in experiments had begun to spiral out of control. The laboratory's
price tag had already risen from 24 million to 32m and was expected to
increase even more as security estimates soared.
Now talks are going on between research chiefs and government officials in a
attempt to find alternative ways of supporting research on apes, which have
brains similar to humans and are considered vital for developing new
treatments for neurological disorders. At the same time the Home Office is
preparing a specific set of laws to protect UK scientists from attacks.
Most senior scientists and drug company officials believe only a few dozen
hardcore activists are responsible for these attacks. 'Britain has the best
neuroscience in the world but a handful of activists are driving away
companies that want to exploit that expertise. And don't forget,
pharmaceuticals made a &amp;pond;3 billion contribution to our balance of trade
last year,' said Trevor Jones, head of the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry.
Tactics used by activists include throwing rape alarms on the roofs of the
homes of lab staff, planting burning crosses in gardens, sending bomb
threats to schools of employees' children, pouring acid on cars, smashing
homes and daubing on walls claims that staff are rapists and paedophiles.
'Nobody wants to disrupt the right to peaceful protest but this is beyond
what any civilised society should be expected to tolerate,' Jones said. 'The
law is not strong enough.'
Between November 1999 and September 2002 an estimated 450 demonstrations,
many of them violent, took place outside Huntingdon Life Sciences
Laboratory, the Cambridge animal research centre that has become a focus for
attacks. There were arrests on only 28 occasions.
'Until scientists can carry out a limited number of controlled experiments
on animals, including primates, we are not going to find cures for
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other diseases,' said Aisling Burnand, chief
executive of the Bioindustry Association.
Last year a wave of attacks were directed against UK-based Japanese
pharmaceutical companies including Yamanouchi, Esai and Daiichi. Executives
were attacked, cars damaged, and homes ransacked. Only the inter vention of
Science Minister Lord Sainsbury, who flew to Japan to assure government and
company officials that Britain was committed to protecting scientists,
prevented firms from leaving the UK.
Some changes to the law have since been introduced but, in the wake of
Cambridge University's decision that it still cannot provide protection for
animal researchers in the city, drug companies are now demanding a clear
signal be sent by government to help the biotechnology industry.
'Specific regulation is needed to tackle this,' said Mark Matfield,
executive director of the Research Defence Society.
The new legislation could make it an imprisonable offence to intimidate a
person because he or she is involved in animal research. Other ideas before
the committee include 50-metre exclusion zones around research centres and
targeting extremists in the way the Football Disorder Act allows hooligans
to be banned from matches merely because police officers have 'reasonable
suspicions' about them.
Other measures would be directed at those who try to intimidate financial
backers of laboratories and research centres. The Government had to step in
to provide insurance for Huntingdon Life Sciences after its insurers, Marsh
&amp; McLellan, backed out after waves of intimidation. At one stage activists
disrupted performances by the English National Ballet because Marsh &amp;
McLellan's UK chairman, Hamish Ritchie, was a member of its board.
Some scientists had already warned about the abandoned primate centre.
Professor Colin Blakemore, head of the Medical Research Council, a leading
UK physiologist and himself the tar get of vicious attacks by animal
activists, told The Observer he had always feared the centre would be
targeted. 'We needed a primate research centre as much as we needed a mouse
research centre or a hamster research centre. That is not how biological
research works. Research on animals should continue to be integrated into
individual science departments.The logic of a centre dedicated to only one
type of animal was always suspect and it was risky to put it in an isolated
part of Cambridge where it could be portrayed by activists as a windowless
temple of animal torture.'
Jan Creamer, chief executive of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, said:
'We don't believe the claim by Cambridge University that they have withdrawn
their plans for security reasons. During the public inquiry they convinced
the inspector that security was not an issue that would prevent the
Cambridge primate lab from being built. Now, a year later, they have changed
their minds.'
In addition, ministers are understood to be seriously considering moving
part of the abandoned laboratory's work to the government's top-secret
chemical weapons establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire, a move that will
infuriate opponents who argue it allow primate experiments to be carried in
total secrecy.
Officials at Porton Down have already begun breeding primates there. One of
its key partners was the University of Cambridge.
Internal government documents also indicate production of primates has
increased at Porton Down's Defence Science &amp; Technology Division for
apparent use at the Cambridge centre. Findings by the animal welfare
advisory committee reveal that while hopes of building the Cambridge site
remained strong, Porton was 'increasing macaque production in the
expectation of increased future experimental demand'.
The new primate breeding facility offers 'state-of-the-art accommodation'
and is designed to house 250 macaques with around 100 of these earmarked for
experiments a year. 'Their quarters are fine. I would not necessarily want
to live in them myself, but as far as they go I think we have very high
standards,' said Defence Minister Lewis Moonie in a parliamentary answer.
However, the idea of carrying out primate experiments for civil research
aimed at creating life-saving drugs is vigoursly opposed by researchers such
as Blakemore. Instead they are preparing to set up 'a distributed centre'
which would supply animals as and when scientists require them for
neurological research.

Bruce Friedrich is a Catholic from the Midwest who was recently rated No. 5 on Details magazine's 2003 list of "The 50 Most Influential People Under 38" -- ahead of Tiger Woods, Leonardo di Caprio and Justin Timberlake. What has Friedrich done to deserve his high standing? Surprise answer: He's an animal rights activist on the governing board of the Catholic Vegetarian Society and the advisory board of the Christian Vegetarian Society. He is also a founding member of the Society of Religious and Ethical Vegetarians, and he's director of vegan campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). I interviewed him via telephone as he was flying from PETA headquarters in Virginia to an assignment in India. 

 

Hi, Bruce. Your opinion is that Catholics -- and all other Christians -- should be vegetarians? 
Jesus' message is about love and compassion, but there is nothing loving or compassionate at factory farms and slaughterhouses, where billions of animals endure miserable lives and die violent deaths. Jesus mandates kindness and mercy for all God's creatures. He'd be appalled by the suffering that we inflict on animals today to indulge our acquired taste for their flesh. 

Catholics, and all Christians, have a choice. When we sit down to eat, we can add to the violence, misery and death in the world, or we can respect God's creatures with a vegetarian diet. I believe we're obligated to make choices that are as merciful as possible, and we can all do that at the dinner table with a vegetarian diet. There won?t be any factory farms and slaughterhouses in heaven. 

So, you think the God of Christians never wanted people to eat meat? 
The Garden of Eden, God's perfect world, was vegetarian (Gen. 1:29-30), and God called this nonexploitative relationship "good" (Gen. 1:31). After Eden there were many, many years of fallen humanity, when people held slaves, waged war, ate animals and committed various other violent acts. But the Old Testament prophets tell us that the final, peaceful Kingdom of God will be nonviolent and vegetarian; even "the lion will lie down with the lamb," according to the prophet Isaiah. That is, even the carnivorous animals will go back to the vegetarian state. I find it empowering that we can begin to live that vision now.

A tractor trailer packed with broiler hens on the way to a chicken processing 
plant, which is a common sight on a Mississippi highway.
Chicken processing is a dirty business, but no job in a poultry plant is more 
dreaded than ?live hang.? Here, workers known as ?chicken hangers? grab 
birds by their feet and sling them on to fast-moving metal hooks. This is the 
first ? and dirtiest ? stage of poultry processing. The birds, weighing 
approximately five pounds each, fight back by pecking, biting, and scratching the 
hangers, who wear plastic cones around their forearms to shield off chicken 
attacks. Then, as workers finally hoist the birds onto the hooks, the chickens 
urinate and defecate out of desperation, often hitting the workers below. 

The next stage ? the ?kill room? ? may be bloodier, but most of the work 
there is done by laser-sharpened buzz-saws; only rarely does a chicken slip past 
the saw with its throat intact. Although no one has figured out how to 
sanitize the nasty job of hanging chickens, poultry managers pride themselves on the 
efficiency of their plants. One plant manager in Laurel, Mississippi, 
described his plant to me as ?an automobile factory in reverse: They put cars 
together, we take chickens apart.? </docText>

        <docText>A drug linked to more than 100 deaths is being blamed for a
series of gross miscarriages of justice that have seen
hundreds of parents wrongly accused of child abuse.
A conference drawing together psychologists, social workers
and scientists will hear evidence this week that a drug
called cisapride - used to treat digestive problems and now
withdrawn from the UK market - has resulted in hundreds of
cases of wrong diagnosis.
Experts will claim the drug is known to interrupt the
rhythm
of the heart, causing some youngsters to turn pale and
experience breathing difficulties. Campaigners say the
symptoms have prompted doctors to wrongly accuse parents of
trying to smother their children.  The revelation will
raise
further questions about the validity of the controversial
condition Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) - first
theorised in 1977 by paediatrician Professor Sir Roy Meadow
- which suggests some parents harm their children to draw
attention to themselves.
Critics of MSBP, which has been discredited following a
series of court cases, fear it blinds social workers,
lawyers and judges to other explanations for apparent child
abuse, such as the side effects of drugs or the symptons
associated with a number of illnesses.  The conference, at
Sydney University in Australia, aims to debunk MSBPand is
set to attract worldwide attention. It will hear calls for
a
full investigation into cisapride, which was withdrawn in
the US and the UK three years ago after it was linked to
136
deaths worldwide, including those of two British children.
'Given the amount of cases where cisapride has played a
significant part in the child's treatment and the child's
parents have been diagnosed as having MSBP, it is
imperative
the Government launches an investigation into this drug,'
said Penny Mellor an anti-MSBP campaigner.
The Government said last month that it is to investigate
more than 250 criminal cases in which a parent had been
convicted of murdering a child. The decision was taken
after
a series of overturned convictions.  Sally Clark was freed
after spending three years in jail for killing her two
children. Trupti Patel was acquitted of smothering her
three
babies. Angela Cannings, jailed for killing her two sons,
was released by the Court of Appeal last December.
The Government is also planning to ask local authorities to
examine up to 5,000 cases in which children were taken from
their parents in the civil courts and in which MSBP may
have
been cited. Authorities in the US, Canada, Australia and
New
Zealand, are also under pressure to examine cases in which
parents were separated from their children following the
diagnosis of MSBP.
The first civil cases involving parents who claim they were
wrongly separated from their children as a result of MSBP,
are currently being prepared for appeal.  Meadow and
another
paediatrician who has advanced the MSBP theory, Professor
David Southall, are now the subjects of separate inquiries
by the General Medical Council. The Observer has also
learnt
that there are at least four other experts in the field of
MSBP whose work is now likely to be scrutinised by the
health authorities.
Since The Observer highlighted the allegation that MSBP was
responsible for a series of miscarriages of justice last
week, numerous other cases where the parents claim they
have
been wrongly separated from their child have come to light.
In one case in Hampshire, a mother accused of MSBP was
separated from her two seriously ill twins but allowed to
keep her other two children. The twins were eventually put
into care and the mother was forced to give the other two
children up for adoption. She subsequently emigrated to New
Zealand where she alleges British social services contacted
counterparts there with the result that two other children
she had with another partner ended up being taken into
care.
Her case is one of the first that is expected to be
appealed
this year.
Janssen Pharmaceutica, makers of cisapride, declined to
comment.

VIN Note:  Janssen were also involved in the Propulsid atrocities (1998) in 
which a drug known to kill children was deliberately marketed via child 
health organisations.

While visiting Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, 
European Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin is attending today an expert 
seminar on the trends affecting agriculture and food production. Agro-food 
research today has to respond to challenges, such as agriculture policy reform, 
enlargement of the European Union, international trade issues, new technologies 
and rapidly evolving consumer attitudes. On this occasion three major new 
projects are being launched in the agro-food area that the EU is to support with 
research funds totalling ?43 million through the Sixth Research Framework 
Programme (FP6). The projects launched are the first major FP6 activities which 
take the "farm-to-fork" approach. SAFE FOODS is an integrated project on risk 
analysis in food safety, which aims to improve consumer protection, NuGO is a 
network of excellence to integrate genomics, nutrition and health, and WELFARE 
QUALITY is an integrated project on animal welfare and food production (see 
annex). 
"Meeting consumers' expectations for good and safe food, while at the same 
time ensuring sustainable agriculture and fostering a competitive industry, 
requires ambitious R&amp;D efforts and strong cooperation at European level. Consumers 
increasingly demand to know where their food comes from and what it brings 
them. That is why we develop in the EU Sixth Research Framework Programme a new 
"farm to fork" approach, which opens new perspectives for producing food that 
responds to environmental, health and competitiveness objectives,"said 
Research Commissioner Busquin.</docText>

The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity had planned to help the animals of Athens after 
an incident involving the death of a raccoon -- but one organization doesn't 
want their services. 
The local chapter of the fraternity imposed sanctions on the three men 
involved in the incident, including social probation for one month and 25 hours of 
community service at the Humane Society. 
But Lisa Klein, executive director of the Athens Area Humane Society, said 
her organization has declined the men's service based on the information she 
knows about the occurrence. 
"We're not comfortable because there has been an incident where one of the 
gentlemen committed animal cruelty and the other two undertook an act of 
violence with the animal," she said. 
The incident happened last December when the fraternity brothers were 
involved in killing, skinning, burning and consuming a raccoon near the fraternity 
house. 
Erik Zimmerman, from Marble, N.C., was arrested and released on bond for 
misdemeanor animal cruelty charges resulting from his alleged involvement in 
shooting and killing the raccoon. 
The fraternity decided to sanction them with community service, requiring 
that they work with animals, said Claudia Shamp, director of Greek Life. 
But Klein said she was not aware of the fraternity's plans to send members 
there for community service until she read about it in the newspaper.</docText>

Animal-liberationists force medical research on the backburner.
...
The anti-human values that permeate the animal-rights/liberation movement
are, once again, vividly on public display. Cambridge University, under
pressure from animal liberationists, recently announced it has dropped a
proposed multimillion-pound research project that would have, in part,
conducted experiments on monkeys in the urgent search for the causes of
and cures for devastating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, Huntington's, and stroke.
...
The Silver Springs Monkey Case appears to have been the brainchild of Alex
Pacheco, cofounder of PETA with Ingrid Newkirk, and like her, an
"animal-rights" fanatic who believes that animals are equal to people.
"The time will come," he once stated, "when we will look upon the murder
of animals as we now look on the murder of men."
...
Tremendous human suffering can be eliminated as a result of the proper and
humane use of animals in medical research. Of necessity, this must in some
cases include primates, which are indispensable in the development of an
HIV/AIDS vaccine, research into malaria, hepatitis B and C, and the
development of promising therapies to treat devastating neurological
conditions.

But animal liberationists could care less. And it isn't just about
monkeys. As far as they are concerned, better your grandmother die slowly
of Alzheimer's disease than allow any animals to be used in crucial
medical research.</docText>

        <docText>Peter Standring, a correspondent/producer for National 
Geographic On Assignment, spent three weeks in and around Nairobi, Kenya, to 
investigate who has been killing Kenya's lions, and why. Watch his report on 
Wednesday, February 11 at 7 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT on the U.S. National Geographic Channel. 
It had been another long, frustrating day at Nairobi National Park in Kenya. 
The sun was setting in a fiery red glow behind the dark profile of the Ngong 
Hills; the light reflected warmly off the flat-topped acacia trees, bringing 
them to life. Beyond, the skyscrapers of downtown Nairobi flickered and 
sparkled. Yet we were glum. We had been in the park since dawn, driving along its maze 
of dirt roads, craning our necks and straining our eyes, searching for lions. 
Exhausted and fed up with our lack of success, we finally put down our 
binoculars and video camera. 

 
Farmers and cattle owners sever the head of a lion using a machete. (Below) 
Jubilant farmers hold up mutilated limbs in front of a television crew. Their 
goal was to send a clear, strong message to government officials and park 
managers, who, in the farmers' view, had been ignoring their suffering.</docText>

The viruses that cause bird flu, Sars, and Ebola formerly affected only 
animals. For some reason, they crossed the border between species, and infected 
humans in Asia, particularly. But the mad cow disease that affected Americas 
traveled in the opposite direction. It crossed from humans to animals and back 
again. Mad cow disease was originally caused by human cannibalism. A small tribe 
in New Zealand ate their dead relatives as a sign of love and respect for 
them. They ate everything, including the brains, where the virus multiplied. 
Somehow, the virus crossed to animals. 
Because of man's greed for profit, ranchers rendered dead animals to feed the 
grass-eating sheep. The extra protein made them grow faster and fatter. Thus, 
the virus of the disease was transferred to them. The same thing happened to 
cattle. In feed lots where cattle from the ranches were fattened, they were 
fed protein from corn, soybeans -- mixed with rendered dead animals. Rendering 
is a process by which animals are boiled in huge vats until the fat melts and 
the tissues break down. The resulting brew is then dried and mixed with animal 
feed. The virus punches holes in the brains of the animals so that they 
stagger about crazy until they fall and die, hence the term "mad cow" disease. 
Ebola used to be confined to monkeys. Primitive African tribes, who hunted 
wild animals for food, including monkeys, got the disease from them. Ebola is a 
horrible disease. The victim bleeds and rots from inside -- literally. Blood 
oozes out of every orifice in the body. This oozing is very contagious. 
Laboratories in the United States that used monkeys for their experiments had to kill 
all the monkeys in their compounds.</docText>

"We don't know what it is, ma'am, so it must be a virus."
Now, we don't just have bacteria, fungi and viruses to fear as 
disease-causing agents - prions now get into the picture. Prions are known to be the cause 
of the cow disease BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), a similar disease in 
sheep and goats called scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy and chronic 
wasting disease of mule deer and elk.
Human diseases caused by prions include CJD (Cruetzfeldt-Jakob), vCJD 
(variant CJD, in which the syndrome is similar but the cause is BSE prion, not CJD 
prion), GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), kuru, FFI (fatal 
insomnia) and Alper's Syndrome.
What makes a prion a prion? It is a form of protein. Like viruses, prions 
attack cells, and do their damage inside the cell. Unlike viruses, they lack RNA 
and DNA, and therefore cannot change the genetic code of the cell. What they 
can do, though, is just as damaging. They convert normal protein molecules into 
dangerous ones just by inducing the normal molecules to bend their shape. 
Thus, they can cause disease by inheritance as well as by infection.</docText>

Fido and Fifi can join the wellness boom at a clinic offering inexpensive 
animal health checkups. 
PetLuv, the county's nonprofit spay and neuter center, will open today a 
comprehensive wellness clinic for dogs and cats at its 7348 Broad St. location in 
Brooksville.
The clinic will offer the new service to all pet owners, but the elderly, who 
often cannot afford regular veterinarian visits, will benefit the most, 
supporters say. 
"The vets are going to vilify us for us doing this full-service work but 
we're not trying to take any business away from them," said Richard Silvani, who 
opened the clinic in 1997. "We're expanding because there's need."
"A huge number of people out there are priced out of the market and can't 
afford veterinary care," said Silvani, a retired Air Force colonel. "If they walk 
into a vet's office, they'll walk out $150 poorer." 
PetLuv's $15 office exam by a licensed veterinarian will include a checkup of 
heart, lungs, teeth, eyes and ears. Any other treatment would be extra, 
according to Silvani. The exams will be held Tuesdays by appointment only. 
"We're not out to make money; we're going to price the exams as low as 
possible because we're a nonprofit group," he added.</docText>

So was he fat or svelte or maybe a tad chubby? Was it really a slip on the
ice or could it have been something else - even, dare it be said,
something he ate?

Now there are confidential documents passed to the news media, and still
more dueling authorities, not to mention the ticklish matter of the mayor
and the doctor's widow and the promised steak dinner.
...
The latest twist is the publication in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday
of details from Dr. Atkins's confidential medical report. The report
concludes that Dr. Atkins, 72, had a history of heart attack and
congestive heart failure and notes that he weighed 258 pounds at death.
...
Dr. Fleming was not a treating physician, and, according to Ms. Borakove,
did not say he was. A critic of the Atkins diet, he passed the report on
to a group he was acquainted with, the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, which promotes a vegetarian diet and denounces the
Atkins plan.

The Physicians Committee gave the report to The Journal. Ms. Borakove said
that a television station in New York apparently also has a copy, because
it called her last week. (The Physicians Committee furnished a copy
yesterday to The Times.)
...
Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, made it clear that it was not Dr. Atkins's health alone that
interested him. "I'm concerned about the Atkins machine trying to play the
card that Atkins was healthy and thin into old age," he said. In his view,
the Atkins diet "was and is an imminent public health threat."

Dr. John McDougall, a member of the Physicians Committee and an internist
who had debated Dr. Atkins, said there was no doubt that Dr. Atkins had
lost weight after his cardiac arrest, but before that was a different
story. "I knew the man," he said. "He was grossly overweight. I thought he
was 40 to 60 pounds overweight when I saw him, and I'm being kind."</docText>

A not-so-civil war has erupted at the Sierra Club, the country's oldest
and largest environmental group, and its leaders say that the heart and
soul of the venerable, San Francisco-based organization are at stake.

The fight centers on the club's policy on immigration. At issue is whether
the club should adopt a position of strict U.S. immigration controls as a
way to limit the environmental impact of overpopulation -- and risk
alienating many of the progressive groups that typically ally themselves
with the club.

The immigration issue has polarized club members before, but this time the
battle has taken on an epic quality, involving a host of other issues,
from animal rights to the club's own democratic traditions, and attracting
the involvement of an array of outside groups trying to influence the
club's policies. 
...
They note that many outside groups -- ranging from People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals to white supremacy organizations -- have waded into
the controversy, urging their members to join the club simply to cast
their votes for one slate or the other.
...
"If it wasn't so sad, it'd be comical," said Frank Morris, a board

And yet, they just hammer us with these absurd, ad hominen attacks."

A national wildlife group is asking Interior Secretary Gale Norton to turn 
her legal eye on Alaska's aerial wolf control program and find that it violates 
federal law. 
Defenders of Wildlife submitted a 15-page petition Monday requesting that 
Norton find that the Airborne Hunting Act of 1971 does not allow the use of 
aircraft to kill wolves to boost game populations. 
The Washington, D.C.-based group also is asking that Norton amend the federal 
law to say: "A state may not issue permits, or engage in any otherwise 
prohibited activity under the Airborne Hunting Act, for the purpose of manipulating 
any wildlife populations." 
Alaska currently has a state-sponsored aerial wolf kill program under way in 
two areas of the state. The game board will consider expanding the program to 
other parts of the state at a meeting in several weeks. 
"Because the programs are for the purpose of enhancing hunting and other 
recreational opportunities, unrelated to protecting wildlife, they violate the 
Airborne Hunting Act," the group said in its petition. 
The group is turning to the federal government for relief after another 
animal rights group, Friends of Animals, failed in state court to put a stop to the 
program in the McGrath area in the Interior and around Glennallen in 
Southcentral. 
"Our efforts to address this issue with Alaska's leaders have fallen on deaf 
ears, leaving us no choice but to turn to the federal government for help," 
Defenders of Wildlife spokesman Joel Bennett said in a statement. 
Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski remains supportive of the wolf control 
program, despite a national campaign from Friends of Animals, with about 200,000 
members, to boycott Alaska's $2 billion-a-year tourism industry. 
Alaska voters banned aircraft-assisted, land-and-shoot wolf hunting in ballot 
measures in 1996 and 2000. But the Alaska Legislature last year passed a law 
allowing private citizens to participate in state-sponsored predator control 
programs. 
The program aims to kill 40 wolves near McGrath and about 140 in the Nelchina 
basin this winter to give young moose a better chance of surviving. In both 
areas, residents have long complained that bears and wolves eat too many moose, 
driving down the moose population and leaving too few to hunt for food.

Okay, first things first: The animal-rights people claim veal calves are
treated cruelly. So I looked it up, point for point. Here are the main points:

The PETA-types complain that the animals are kept in confining pens that
don't allow the animals to move or even to lie down (much like my cubicle
at work). The veal farmers counter that the pens come only up to shoulder
height, thus allowing the animals to socialize; the pens are large enough
to allow the calves to lie down, stand up, and groom themselves; and
having pens allows careful individual monitoring for health and helps
prevent the spread of disease.

Now, check your Bible for "swaddling clothes," then ask an anthropologist
about it.
...
Veal generally will be more tender and mild-flavored than the average cut
of beef. Hence, like tofu, it is immensely versatile. If you can find a
whole veal tenderloin, and you feel like making a real celebration of a
given meal (i.e., this isn't something you're going to do every day and

Perhaps veal stew. If you want to make a crust from scratch: veal pot pie.
Yankee veal roast. Old-fashioned Southern pulled barbecued veal.

Get yourself some baby cow today. It's perfectly humane; it's moderately

 USPCA inspector Penny Keys examining a cage and a dead fox
INVESTIGATORS have uncovered a macabre badger-baiting ring, driven by 
underground criminals betting thousands of pounds on ritual cage slayings, the 
Belfast Telegraph can today reveal. 
The USPCA now believes the brutal practice has become a weekly event in some 
parts of the province, with badgers and other animals being thrown into cages 
to be ripped apart by dogs while bets are waged. 
The Telegraph yesterday shadowed a joint PSNI/ USPCA swoop on a Co Derry farm 
which was conducted after a tip-off that the horrific practice was taking 
place there. 
While no badgers were found, horrific scenes of a sheep ripped apart, foxes 
shot and mauled and dogs with severe injuries to their muzzles have led the 
USPCA to the conclusion that the outlawed practice was being carried out. 
A number of large traps, believed to be used for catching badgers, were found 
at a rundown outhouse. 
And yards away a dead fox which had been shot in the back was still warm.
The corpse of a second fox was contained within a 6ft mesh "cage" which 
animal welfare officers believe is being used as a killing arena. </docText>

A man scheduled to appear in court Friday on felony animal abuse charges 
continued to collect dozens of cats, rabbits and dogs in his Snow Creek area home 
despite a restraining order to stay away from animals. 

A visit Wednesday to a house from which Doug Yates and his wife, Joyce, were 
being evicted revealed they had kept more than a dozen cats and rabbits shut 
into an otherwise empty bedroom, some in cages.

Neighbors estimated there were more than 30 animals in the home. Animal 
activists have recently expressed concern about what they call animal collectors.

In the past two years, several widely reported cases of animal cruelty, 
including problems at facilities operated by the Riverside County Animal Control 
Services, have brought efforts for reform.

At the Yates home on Wednesday, the metal blinds on a front window were 
clawed to shreds in places and through a window streaks of feces were visible on 
the walls and marble floors.

Joyce Yates, who is not charged with any crime, said in a telephone interview 
that she had taken in the animals to save them from being destroyed in local 
shelters. </docText>

        <docText>Indigenous people from around the world demanded at 
a conference Wednesday that governments respect aboriginal land ownership and 
halt development and resettlement programs that can harm the environment.

Hundreds of thousands of indigenous people have been displaced from their 
territories, often by modernization programs that don't adequately compensate 
them, activists said on the sidelines of a U.N.-backed biodiversity conference.

"Atrocities against indigenous people across the world are incredible," said 
Canadian activist Fred Fortier of the International Indigenous Forum on 
Biodiversity.

Indigenous groups urged governments at the conference to enforce policies 
that give communities the right to reject development projects, Fortier said. 
They also want the right to fight involuntary resettlement and reject any 
unilateral creation of protected areas or commercial exploitation of their natural 
resources, Fortier said.

He was speaking at the nearly two-week Seventh Conference of the Parties to 
the Convention on Biological Diversity, which started Monday in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. More than 2,000 government delegates, scientists, and 
environmentalists at the conference will discuss a plan to help indigenous people share 
wealth created by their resources.

But some activists said this misses the point that aboriginal communities 
often place their cultural and spiritual values above financial reward.

"We are linked to our land," said Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of 
Congo's Mbuti pygmies. "We must not be ordered to leave for money or material 
compensation. That is not what we're seeking."</docText>

        <docText>he Feline Conservation Federation, the nation?s 
oldest non-profit organization dedicated to excellence in exotic feline care is 
opposed to HB1151. ?It is part of the 11,000 animal bills and ordinances being 
proposed nation-wide this year at every level of government. There is an 
epidemic of hysteria orchestrated by animal rights extremists to sell an agenda 
that America won?t buy at face value, and it is a recipe for disaster?, said 
Lynn Culver, Legal Affairs Director of the FCF.

?The challenge of leadership is to avoid hysteria when tragedies happen, to 
be rational and informed so as not to do more harm then good. That?s why facts 
and statistics must supercede horror stories. There is an average of one death 
per year from big cat accidents in a population of 15,000. Statically this 
means driving a motor vehicle is three times more dangerous then keeping a 
tiger. The likelihood of a tiger escaping and killing a member of the general 
public cannot be calculated because it has never happened?, says Lynn Culver.

        <docText>He began researching nutrition and diets more than 30 years ago, long before 
it became fashionable to talk about low carbs and high fats. 
Dr. David Jenkins, Canada Research Chair in nutrition and metabolism at the 
University of Toronto, began his work at Oxford University in England in 1972, 
when scientists were just beginning to realize the importance of "sticky 
fibres" like oats and barley in cutting cholesterol. 
"I cut my teeth on fibre, and it's been downhill ever since," says Jenkins, 
62, now considered a world leader in nutrition research. 
He came to U of T in 1980 and began looking at foods that are low in glycemic 
index ? pumpernickel and bulgur in particular ? that are useful in keeping 
glucose levels down. 
From there, he moved into "the soy age," exploring why soy products lower 
cholesterol. Then he went on to nuts and found that almonds in particular do the 
same thing. After that, it was plant sterols, which exist in plant oils and 
leafy vegetables and were found to block cholesterol absorption.</docText>

A recent financial risk assessment "showed a significant shortfall in the 
project funding" 
Scientists and animal rights campaigners are at odds after the Government 
gave Cambridge University permission to build a research centre where tests will 
be carried out on monkeys.
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott ruled in favour of the project after the 
local planning authority and an inspector found against it.
The university said the proposed centre at Girton, near Cambridge, was vital 
for the development of research into diseases such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's.
However it admitted there were problems over funding the project.
South Cambridgeshire District Council refused permission after police raised 
fears about public safety at the site, which is on a main road.
The university appealed against the council's decision and a public inquiry 
was held last year.
An inspector recommended the appeal be dismissed but Mr Prescott disagreed 
and granted planning permission.
His decision report said: "The Secretary of State accepts the potential for 
disruption of the surrounding road network and associated safety concerns and 
he accords such concerns significant weight.
"Because of this he has considered whether there is a clearly more suitable 
alternative site ... but has concluded that none has been identified...
"In light of the national importance of the research work envisaged which is 
in line with stated Government policy, combined with the lack of a clearly 
more suitable alternative site, the Secretary of State concludes that ... very 
special circumstances exist that are sufficient to outweigh any harm to the 
Green Belt and other interests caused by the development."
Cambridge pro vice-chancellor Professor Tony Minson said the university was 
"pleased that this important research centre has been given the go-ahead".</docText>

Is this once taboo trend making its way back to the fashion frontlines, or
are we faking it?

Notice anything different in the celeb rag mags lately? There?s a lot more
real fur being worn on the red carpet, in the swank clubs and on the
catwalk. Real fur. No disclaimers. No apologies.

Are we seeing a resurgence in the popularity of wearing fur in public even
in the face of protest, or is it all illusion? Is it real or is it faux -
really good, easy-to-fool-us faux fur? And are sales of real fur up or down? 
...
In an era when wearing furs may not be PC to many and groups such as
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are putting up disturbing
protest billboards and promoting faux fur with a barely wrapped Melissa
Rivers, and celebrities have come out to say, "No, I?ll only wear faux!,"
how is it that so many are coming back to real fur, and so many designers
are bucking the protesters and designing with the real stuff?
...
Sperlazzi agrees. "The younger set likes ?luxe.? They follow fashion. If
it?s not the garment, it?s the trim or the accessory."

But talk to PETA and you?ll get a different story.

Michael McGraw, media spokesman for the group, admits that more designers
are using fur.

"Design houses are sending these young design students to Denmark and
spending tons of money to provide them with real fur to work with," he
says. "But fashion is fickle."

He also says that what we see in the popular media about fur is an
illusion. "These celebrities who look like they?re wearing fur probably
aren?t. Faux fur has gotten so realistic-looking even the media can?t
tell, and they don?t bother to find out. The technology has gotten so good
that if it looks like real fur, they?ll write ?fur.?" 
...
And about faux, Sperlazzi says, "Faux fur is positive for the fur industry
as a whole. It?s big in the junior market. These young women want the
look, but can?t afford it yet."

Does she or doesn?t she wear real fur? Apparently with advances in faux
fur and real fur design alike, only the furrier knows for sure.

MARIO is a full-figured man, but notice how his ensemble provides a
slimming effect. He is wearing a puffy black jacket, baggy jeans and a
pair of Air Force 1 sneakers that he bought in Brooklyn for $85. What
draws the eye, though, is his Cleveland Cavaliers jersey, a LeBron James
model.
...
And here are five, no seven, no nine - here are at least 13 officers of
the New York Police Department. They are wearing blue pants, blue caps and
blue duty jackets, possibly purchased from the equipment room at 1 Police
Plaza. From their black belts hang loops of plastic handcuffs.

One of them also wears three blue chevrons high on his sleeve, creating a
"sergeant" effect. He is conferring with a burly fashion show employee
whose black suit is offset by a tag featuring the word "security" and a
picture of a stiletto-heeled shoe. Next on the Sixth Avenue runway, it
seems, is PETA, the animal rights group.

In the past, PETA routinely disrupted fashion shows that featured the
works of designers they called "fur pimps." A couple of years ago, though,
the group reached an understanding with the organizers of Fashion Week
that allowed the activists to deliver their anti-fur message while the
fashion world was in town.

Here comes Michael, a PETA spokesman, in a long gray coat made of cotton,
acrylic and polyester. He greets the security man in black, and ground
rules for a 15-minute demonstration are finalized. A section of the steps
leading to the tent are roped off.</docText>

screams pamphlets outside one of the chicken shops in Zampa Bazaar area. Many 
others have followed suit with chicken sales recording a drastic fall after the 
news of two million chicken dying in Pakistan of avian influenza rocked the 
country a few days back. 
It appears that the possibility of the virulent flu hopping from Pakistan to 
India has scared the non-vegetarians so much that they now prefer to swear by 
their greens. The result? Slaughter houses have lost loyal customers; such is 
the scare that fresh chicken which was selling between Rs 80 to Rs 90 per kg a 
fortnight back is now being sold at Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg. The scare has hit 
egg sales too. Eggs which were selling at Rs 140 per crate are now being sold 
at Rs 100 per crate. The slaughter houses which were selling about 30,000 to 
35,000 kg of chicken per day are now selling only about 5,000 kg of chicken. </docText>

Robert Atkins spent his life telling people they could eat fat and stay
slim. But according to his medical records, the man behind the Atkins diet
was obese at the time of his death.

The medical records, leaked to the media yesterday, also showed that Dr
Atkins had heart disease and hypertension, conditions that have been
linked to high-fat diets.

At first blush, the news has the potential to devastate the estimated 30
million followers of the counter-intuitive Atkins diet, which encourages
people to eat a diet high in protein (such as red meat) but low in
carbohydrates (cereals, pasta and rice).

But Dr Atkins's medical report was released by an organisation that has
long campaigned against his diet. It opposes consumption of meat and
promotes a vegan diet as a way of preventing cancer.

The medical report, leaked to The Wall Street Journal, shows that Dr
Atkins, at 1.83 metres, weighed 116 kilograms last year. This would have
given him a score of 35 under the body mass index calculation, used across
the world to define whether a person is of healthy weight or not. Under
the BMI, a score of 25 defines one as overweight. Over 30 and you are obese. 
...
Dr Atkins, a cardiologist, said in a TV interview three months before he
died that he had a heart attack in 2002 and that he believed his heart
disease was caused by a virus.

The medical examiner's office said this week that Dr Atkins's medical
report was "sent in error" to Richard Fleming, a member of the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine, which runs an anti-Atkins website.

Dr Fleming last year released the diet book Stop Inflammation Now!, which
promotes a diet that is all fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

The Atkins company deplored the leaking of Dr Atkins's medical records to
"a known group of vegan and animal rights extremists".

Neither Dr Fleming nor the group he represents answered calls. </docText>

At the risk of sounding like a liberal, I am going to present this
argument. As you read it, I hope that you will understand as I do...it is
not a liberal nor a conservative issue, rather one of common sense and
decency. Just in case you are wondering...I detest PETA and I eat meat
(just like my dogs!).

The cruel practice of testing new pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products on
animals must stop and I believe I have a viable replacement. There is not
one person of conscience who could visit an animal testing facility
without deciding that it is wrong. At the same time, there is not one
reasonable person who could visit a maximum security prison and agree that
rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and child molesters deserve a
comfortable life, or that they should simply be warehoused until they die,
or released to bring about more harm. 
...
Our bloated prison population is growing everyday and it is not for the
reasons that liberals traditionally offer. The fact is that evil is
becoming more and more prevalent in this society, as is a lack of personal
responsibility. Testing on animals is an evil that must end and testing on
violent criminals is a way to truly make these thugs pay their debt to
society.

The animals mentioned in this column are available for adoption at their 
respective animal shelters. These shelters do not euthanize unless the animal has 
a contagious or terminal disease.
These animals are all healthy, and have been selected by the managers of the 
shelters as animals who would make ideal pets for certain individuals. Because 
many people prefer puppies or kittens, it is the adult animals who have a 
more difficult time finding homes, and are at risk of spending long periods of 
time, if not their entire lives in a shelter.

dogfighting case out of Avalon.
Kennan Lopez Williams, 35, of Arlington turned himself into authorities 
Friday, Feb. 6, sheriff?s Lt. Danny Williams said. Williams was charged with a 
state jail felony charge of animal cruelty and posted bond of $10,000.
?He has not given us any statement,? Williams said. ?At this time we are not 
anticipating any further arrests; however, we are still investigating this 
matter.?
Wallace Thompson, 65, of Avalon had turned himself into authorities Feb. 5. 
He was booked into the Wayne McCollum Detention Center on a charge of cruelty 
to animals and released on a $5,000 bond following his arraignment.
Thompson?s relative, 18-year-old Christopher Gowins, was taken into custody 
Jan. 26. He has since been released on a $10,000 bond for a charge of cruelty 
to animals.
The Sheriff?s Office began its investigation into the suspected dogfighting 
ring after it was contacted by a Metroplex-based humane society, which had 
received a tip about the illegal activity.</docText>

        <docText>A model wears a vanilla mink and satin coat and lace dress at the Badgley 
Mischka Fall 2004 show at Bryant Park in New York, Monday, Feb. 9, 2004.
 

Fur is used to trim suits, skirts, outerwear and evening dresses. And a 
pelting of vintage-look three-quarter-length coats is in store.
 
Sometimes fur even replaces fabric altogether, as in Bradley Bayou's 
off-the-shoulder minidress made of strips of silver fox, which was among the looks in 
his made-to-order Halston collection.
 
Despite a gruesome Tuesday morning protest staged by the People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals organization in front of the Bryant Park tents, the 
flurry of fur has been positively blizzardlike.
 
Designers must have been affected by New York's cold winter, so anxious are 
they to clad their customers in mink, sable or fox.
 
Perhaps the most imaginative uses of fur were seen in Mark Badgley and James

At the risk of sounding like a liberal, I am going to present this argument. 
As you read it, I hope that you will understand as I do...it is not a liberal 
nor a conservative issue, rather one of common sense and decency. Just in case 
you are wondering...I detest PETA and I eat meat (just like my dogs!).

The cruel practice of testing new pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products on 
animals must stop and I believe I have a viable replacement. There is not one 
person of conscience who could visit an animal testing facility without deciding 
that it is wrong. At the same time, there is not one reasonable person who 
could visit a maximum security prison and agree that rapists, murderers, drug 
dealers, and child molesters deserve a comfortable life, or that they should 
simply be warehoused until they die, or released to bring about more harm. 

Regardless of the immorality of testing on innocent animals, it makes no 
sense to test a new drug or procedure on them. Who better to test a drug produced 
for humans than another human? Rapists and murderers have given up their 
rights, these are people that have brought about terrible suffering throughout 
their lives. Shouldn?t they be given the chance to contribute something, for once 
in their lives? </docText>

        <docText>The first confirmed case of mad cow disease in
the United States has given consumers food for thought about what they put
on their dinner tables.

Food scares - Alar on apples, PCBs in farm-raised salmon, E. coli in
hamburgers - typically do. Although there are no documented cases of
anyone dying from the first two food-related issues, some have died from
E. coli.

But when it comes to mad cow, technically known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, once a person is infected, there is no question about the
outcome - he or she will die. To date, 143 persons in the United Kingdom
have died from the disease that literally eats away at the brain.
...
But some food industry experts wonder if the mad cow scare marks a
watershed event - a moment when a small but growing market for organic
food explodes in popularity. Although they don't expect a nationwide surge
in vegetarian eating habits - estimated at between 4 and 10 percent - they
do expect some shift in the food chain.

"This could be a shove in what I think is the right direction," said
Marion Nestle, author of the widely discussed - and debated - book "Food
Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health," which
generally took big food to task for many of the country's health woes.
...
"Most stores are reporting they're getting about 30 calls a day from
people asking about organic goods, and that doesn't mean they're all the
sudden going to become vegetarians, but are looking for safer
alternatives," Tuitele said.

The beef industry is fighting back. The National Cattlemen's Beef
Association launched a $4 million television ad campaign promoting beef on
Jan. 26.
...
IS THIS FOOD REALLY NATURAL?

Here are the definitions of "organic" and "natural," according to the USDA:

Organic: A USDA-accredited certification agency must attest that the
animals have never received antibiotics or added-growth hormones. In
addition, all feeds must be certified organic.

Natural: Minimally processed, no artificial ingredients. The USDA permits
no preservatives in these products.</docText>

Oxford University's new facility for housing laboratory animals, currently 
under construction, will be a "legitimate target" for violent protests, 
according to animal rights activists.
A source from the Animal Liberation Front, long associated with the radical 
wing of animal activism, told The OxStu that "new animal facilities proposed at 
Oxford would be seen as a legitimate target for ALF members." When asked what 
form such protests could take, the source pointed to previous action taken 
against animal tests at Huntingdon Life Sciences in Cambridgeshire, and said 
that possible action could "range from smashing windows with rocks to arson 
attacks against entire departments." 
Planned for the University science area on South Parks Road, the new building 
will bring animals from several different sites under one roof. The 
University claims it will provide "state-of the-art housing" for its animals, with the 
University Veterinary Department on hand to offer advice. Vice-Chancellor Sir 
Colin Lucas stated: "Animals are used in research only when it is essential to 
do so because no effective alternatives exist."</docText>

Federal trappers in Minnesota killed only 125 wolves in 2003, down 
substantially from the average of about 175 in recent years, apparently because a skin 
malady has cut into the wolf population.
Complaints of wolves attacking livestock and pets have been dropping and have 
been nearly nonexistent in recent months, and it appears the state's wolf 
herd may be declining a bit after years of growth.
The decline in complaints has been dramatic, said Bill Paul, who heads the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's wildlife service's program in northern 
Minnesota.
Paul believes mange, a skin problem that causes animals to die from exposure, 
may be reducing overall wolf numbers in the Minnesota.
"We aren't getting the calls we usually do. We haven't had any calls of pet 
attacks at all in the past few months," he said. "There are a lot of deer out 
there for them to eat, which helps keeps them away from livestock. But I think 
the big thing is that we've seen a lot of wolves with mange in recent years."</docText>

Ten months after his death, diet guru Robert Atkins is at the centre of
more controversy. A medical report showing he was obese when he died has
been seized on by Atkins opponents with their own views to promote. At
stake is control of the $40bn-a-year diet industry and the profits of
America's food giants

FOR A MAN WHO changed millions of lives, Robert Atkins?s own ended in an
awful mess. Last April he slipped on an icy pavement, banged his head,
suffered (possibly) a heart attack, then went into a coma from which he
never emerged. He died within a week.
...
To enemies of the Atkins diet it looked like a heinous cover-up at the
expense of the ill-fed and the credulous, and yesterday these enemies had
their chance to gloat. It turns out that Atkins died obese, with a history
of heart disease and a score of 35 on a standard index that put him 10
points over merely overweight. ?To us,? says a spokeswoman for a group of
American doctors called Physicians? Committee for Responsible Medicine
(PCRM), ?the significance is we?ve been saying for years and years that
the Atkins diet is a diet that?s likely to cause heart disease.?

But what is the PCRM? Where did it get its information about Dr Atkins?s
corpse? And is this argument really about a global public health
emergency, or something altogether simpler? Determined dieters who?ve
spent small fortunes trying weight-loss programmes from both ends of the
medical opinion spectrum may have an idea of the answer.

The PCRM is a fiercely anti-meat, pro-vegetarian brains trust that has
opposed the Atkins diet for years, apparently with the best of intentions.
It obtained its information on Dr Atkins?s body from Dr Richard Fleming, a
Nebraska-based cardiologist, outspoken critic of the Atkins diet and
author of two high-profile books on how to minimise your risk of heart
disease without a high-protein diet. 
...
This feud is about business. This is not to say it is not also about
health, but it does emphasise with the concision of a fine haiku that in
America, and increasingly here too, health is business.</docText>

Don't let her age or her height fool you. 
Twelve-year-old Sarah Parker is an ambassador. 
Her mission is to get everyone in Albuquerque to spay and neuter their pets. 
"Everything starts with spay and neuter," Sarah said after a news conference 
Jan. 31 at Albuquerque's East Side animal shelter, where Mayor Martin Chavez 
proclaimed February as Have a Heart for Animals Month. "There are just way too 
many animals out there." 
As Chavez spoke, Sarah, along with several other children from the Animal 
Humane Association's Junior Humane Program, served as his backdrop, holding 
bright pink banners that preached the importance of pet sterilization. 
"We don't ever ever want to euthanize another adoptable pet," Chavez said as 
he cradled an 8-week-old white puppy up for adoption at the shelter. 
About 400 unwanted animals are euthanized in the city's shelters every week, 
a result, the mayor said, of the city's "outrageously high" pet overpopulation.
The monthlong campaign, Chavez said, includes open houses at the city's East 
Side and West Side shelters, where people can learn about animal behavior, 
training, and spay and neuter programs for low-income families. 
Also, the mayor and members of his administration, along with veterinarians 
from around the city, will visit Albuquerque schools throughout the month and 
talk to students about responsible pet care.</docText>

Salt Spring's SPCA has put out a distress call to keep it from going under 
financially. 
The local society has now hit the wall after struggling for two years with 
changes imposed by the B.C. Gaming Commission CHECK NAME and the B.C. SPCA 
organization. 
"The idea of it closing is just heartbreaking," said Jena Peori, who has been 
both an SPCA volunteer and part-time employee. 
SPCA stalwart Cathie Newman said the problem first surfaced two years ago. 
"That?s the point we started using our reserves to help us . . . and then we 
were told [by SPCA head office] we couldn't use them anymore." 
Before 2002, Salt Spring?s SPCA applied for and usually received grants from 
the B.C. Gaming Commission, said Newman. Combined with islanders? donations 
and income generated from reserves, the SPCA could cover its costs. 
But gaming commission rules changed in 2002, so that only the head office of 
the SPCA could apply for a grant, which was capped at $250,000 ? about 
one-quarter of the total all branches received the year before.
The branch's 2003 deficit was forgiven by head office but the group was 
advised that would not be done again. 
"So this is why we have to raise the money on the island," said Newman.</docText>

        <docText>A financial helping hand from last weekend's circus in Sebastian 
fell short of the trapeze, officials from the Boys and Girls Club of Indian 
River County reported Tuesday. 
Sarasota's Walker Bros. Circus put on four shows last Friday and Saturday at 
Sebastian Municipal Airport to raise money to help pay operational expenses at 
the club's temporary Sebastian clubhouse. 




"We raised about $685," Leisa Smith-Fulton, the club's executive director, 
said Tuesday. 
Club officials had hoped to get about $2,000 to $3,000 from circus proceeds. 
"I know we didn't hit our goal," Smith-Fulton said, "but we still made some 
money on it. We had a great group of people out there working really hard to 
try to make this a success." 
She said the shows attracted a combined 317 people, including those who 
bought 100 advance tickets. 
Overall, "I think it was a learning event for our first year," Smith-Fulton 
said of the circus fund-raiser. "I think it will have to be put under serious 
consideration if we ever will do anything like this again." 
The Boys and Girls Club provides after-school and summer educational and 
recreation services for local children. 
Last month, the Sebastian City Council agreed to allow the circus to get set 
up on city land as long as it didn't feature elephants or caged animals, such 
as tigers. Council members made that decision after hearing from local animal 
lovers about reported abuse of circus animals. </docText>

If a proposed livestock ordinance being touted by a Jefferson County official 
gains steam, the chickens may indeed come home to roost, but probably not in 
the literal sense Commissioner Mary Zemke intends. 
Calling for looser restrictions on the number of livestock allowed at rural 
homes, Zemke's draft code is already stirring up controversy at Crooked River 
Ranch ? and the proposal hasn't even hit the planning commission yet. 
The guidelines target the smaller, one- to two-acre lots that make up roughly 
half of the Crooked River community. The law would increase the number of 
chickens allowed at the residential development to 50 per acre and approve as 
many as eight pigs, llamas, goats or sheep per one- to two-acre property, with 
four more animals allowed for each additional acre. 
The county currently allows up to 10 chickens per acre and prohibits pigs or 
other mid-size animals at Crooked River Ranch, which is governed by tougher 
livestock codes than the rest of Jefferson County. Exceptions are sometimes made 
for youth farm projects or if the animal is being raised for auction at the 
county fair. </docText>

In 1989 some 1,400 leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) heaved 
themselves ashore to nest at Playa Grande beach in Costa Rica's Las Baulas 
National Marine Park. By 1995 the number emerging from the surf to deposit their eggs 
was less than half this number. Last year fewer than 50 females waded on to 
the beach.

It was a billboard on a crosstown Manhattan bus that got me thinking. The
rolling PSA said something like this: "1 in 500 Americans have AIDS. Only
1 in 250 know." Instantly, my mind responded: 1 in 2 Americans will die of
heart disease. And this: Every seven seconds, an American dies of cancer.

From there, the list grew to:
...
* Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said in 1988, "Eight out of the
ten leading causes of death in America are what you are eating."

Need I go on? There's a self-induced health holocaust/mass suicide going
on that dwarfs any other health crisis in America...and the fallout isn't
only affecting our bodies, it's destroying our planet, funneling ever-more
taxpayer dollars to multi-national corporations, and hijacking our humanity.
...
March 20 also happens to be the 20th anniversary of the annual Great
American Meatout (http://www.meatout.org/) during which non-vegetarians
are encouraged to "kick the meat habit (at least for a day) and explore a
wholesome, nonviolent diet of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."
...
 FEAR OF A VEGAN PLANET

Like so many other aspects of American life, we've relinquished control of
our eating habits to the corporate pirates and their well-paid
indoctrination, eating animals is as "normal" as breathing while the
consequent animal cruelty required to sustain this lifestyle is, at worst,
considered a necessary evil on all sides of the political spectrum.

It's quite a psychological quantum leap to no longer perceive that cow as
a soulless source of protein, but this is precisely the type of emotional
and cultural advance that may spur further introspection into our other
illogical habits, i.e. operating health facilities on a for-profit basis,
renting oneself out as a wage slave eight hours a day, and believing
there's a difference between Republicans and Democrats. The choice is ours.

Veganism welcomes all and requires no political label or pedigree. When
you go vegan, we each make a difference (at least) three times a day.

To ensure workers at poultry farms are not ex-posed to possible avian flu, 
the Cab-inet has roped in the Human Re-sources Ministry.

Human Resources Minister Datuk Dr Fong Chan Onn said his ministry would work 
closely with the Agri-culture, Home, Health and Defence ministries.

"Our role will be to protect workers against the disease," he said after 
chairing the ministry's post-Cabinet meeting today.

He said all workers at bird farms must strictly abide by the directive issued 
by the Department of Occupational Safety and Health to wear protective gear 
at all times when handling birds.

"This directive also applies to those in wet markets, zoos and shops," he 
said, adding that so far, the depart-ment had checked 75 farms and all had 
adhered to the guidelines and directives.

He said DOSH enforcement offi-cers in all States have been told to check bird 
farms and shops and submit a report.

Fong said complacency over the threat of bird flu and other such contagions 
could lead to a RM50,000 fine and three-year jail term under the Occupational

        <docText>For thousands of years, the majestic North American buffalo roamed 
freely over the wide-open plains of the Canadian Prairies. 
Today, most of these brown, woolly beasts spend their time grazing on ranches 
- or in the case of Bailey, watching TV in the living room of an Alberta 
family's home. 
Jim and Linda Sautner are the proud owners of Bailey, a nearly 4-year-old 
bison, who has a penchant for spending his time inside the couple's home, about 
20km west of the provincial capital of Edmonton. 
"My wife wouldn't let me bring my german shepherd puppy in the house one day, 
so I got even with her by bringing Bailey in," Jim Sautner said. 
"He's made a mess on the carpet a couple of times, so now we bring out an 
icecream pail whenever he gives us that look." 
The Sautners, who own 270 head of buffalo, have become accustomed to having 
the 725kg beast in their living room staring at the television. 
"He prefers to watch The Nature of Things," said Jim, referring to a Canadian 
nature television series. 
The couple rescued Bailey as a baby, after the calf was abandoned by his 
mother. Along with farm hands, they bottle-fed Bailey with milk on a daily basis 
and the affinity for one another grew rapidly. </docText>

Dyed monkeys in a zoo of Shengyang, North China's Liaoning Province. 
(sina/file)
    And wouldn't you just know that someone, somewhere would take this 
wonderful concept from the Chinese zodiac - and all the spirit of fun it typically 
engenders - and try to ruin it for everybody. 
    Take the case of the rainbow monkeys of the Forest Safari Park in 
Shenyang in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
    There, a safari park has already put a stain on the year-long 
festivities. At least for me. 
    Someone on the park staff, for some still undetermined boneheaded reason, 
decided to dye all of the park's monkeys various colours of the rainbow. 
    Embarrassed as they were, the monkeys at the park are now being crudely 
shown off - their fur, in some cases, bright red, gold, and, we suppose, green 
and purple. 
    Yes, folks, they park staff has made monkeys out of its monkeys. 
    In fact, a park worker was stupid enough to admit the monkeys knew enough 
not to go along with this harebrained plan. He told a reporter from the 
Xinhua News Agency that - the mammals who are closest to us in intelligence - were 
anything but co-operative when they tried to dolly up their coiffures.</docText>

        <docText>In the next nine months politics, political candidates 
and special-interest campaigns will bombard us from all directions. We will be 
hammered with truths, half-truths and outright lies. As voters, we will have 
to sift through the rhetoric and try to make sense of what we read, what we 
hear and what we see on television.  
The upcoming bear referendum - seeking a ban on hunting bear over bait, 
hunting with dogs and trapping bear - is an issue that will definitely be 
sensationalized, probably by both sides. 
The referendum petitions that were dropped off at the secretary of state's 
office recently had hardly landed when licensed hunters and anglers across the 
state began receiving mail from a group called Maine Citizens for Fair Bear 
Hunting. Although the name sounds innocuous enough, the group's major financial 
supporters and many of those involved in the campaign want to ban all hunting. 
Some even want to end sport fishing. 
Three men claiming to be a master Maine guide, a retired Maine guide and bear 
hunter, and a lifelong hunter signed the letter, asking for donations and 
support from other hunters and anglers. 
These three claimed they are "not members of any animal rights group." This 
may be true, but the major financial sponsors of this measure that would ban 
hunting bears over bait and with dogs is financially supported by the Humane 
Society of the United States and Fund for Animals, two groups that want to see an 
end to all hunting. The bear referendum is a single issue, designed to 
fracture the outdoor community and help achieve their long-term goal of ending all 
hunting.

Sophie Trollope's "cry wolf" is not a false alarm - it is a serious cry to 
protect the animals she so loves, leading her to become an expert in wolf 
behaviour.

She is fighting for the rights of wolves across the globe, and educating 
people about keeping wolf-dogs as pets.

"I started my research on wolf-dogs in 2001. There seem to be several 
thousand wolves in South Africa. Some of these are used for breeding with normal 
dogs, creating the wolf-dog," she said.

Speaking from her Waterkloof home, Trollope recalled how she visited a wolf 
sanctuary, Wolf Park, in the US.

'I had to stand quiet, let a wolf 'choose' me...'
"I have always loved animals. In 1992 I was going through a difficult time 
and I received a husky, Tessa, as a Mother's Day present. She had been abused by 
her previous owner. I only had her for five months before she died," Trollope 
said.

Trying to cope with this loss, she started to collect articles on animals and 
their behaviour. She wanted to prove to herself that Tessa did not die in 
vain after an unhappy life. The following year she went to an animal behaviour 
seminar and saw a video of Wolf Park.

The lure of private investment to finance this project means that the animals

Dr Richard Suuire worried that; ?when a private man comes in, he is first 
interested in money? and was concerned that the level of conservation and 
education in Ghana may come under threat.

There were also fears that a private company may raise the price of entry to 
the Shai Hills to a level unaffordable to most Ghanaians.

The move to the Shai Hills will radically improve the plight of the animals 
currently housed in the zoo.

A source associated with the zoo for more than twenty years, told The 
Chronicle that they had been informed by a figure at the Department of Wildlife ?with 
a smiling face? that there was no money to feed the animals this year.

        <docText>No one can be sure how long the once-fluffy white dog was chained. Weeks? 
Months? A year or more? 
It certainly had been there since he was a puppy, digging into his neck as he 
grew, month by month, until his skin grew over it, in and around the links of 
his grotesque necklace. 
Animal workers in Kinston are outraged, calling it the worst case of animal 
abuse they've ever seen. 
Animal Control Officer Pat Smith found the dog earlier this week behind an 
abandoned house on Water Street, tangled in the chain. Fortunately for the dog, 
someone working at a house next door saw the animal suffering and called the 
authorities. 
"When I found him, he was almost dead," Smith said. "I haven't cried over a 
dog like that in a right good while, but after I found him, well, I cried my 
share."</docText>

Illegal logging is destroying the equatorial rain forests of Indonesian 
Borneo, bringing the island, once known as the lungs of Asia, to the brink of an 
ecological disaster. 
Not only has 95 percent of the forest legally set aside for logging been 
cleared but nearly 60 percent of protected national parkland has been illegally 
logged, according to a new report in this week's Science by professor Lisa M. 
Curran of the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies.
____________________________________________________________________________
"Already, what is left (of the forest) is too small and too fragmented to 
support many of the species that depend on the forest," said Curran, director of 
the Tropical Resources Institute at Yale University. "For the first time we 
have seen large mammals, such as orangutans and Malaysian sun bears, wild boar, 
starving." 
There are more than 420 different birds and 222 mammal species in Kalimantan, 
half of which depend on the rain forests for survival. Furthermore, the 
indigenous people of Borneo, the Dyaks, depend on boar as a primary source of 
protein. 
"Clearly the animals are in crisis," said Curran. "In Gunung Palung National 
Park in West Kalimantan, for example, the orangutan population will drop by a 
third in the next couple of years." </docText>

        <docText>Dozens of dogs found last month at two alleged "puppy mills" 
are being nursed back to health at the Grant County Animal Shelter. 
"They're in much better health than they were when they first got here," said 
Wanda Bedard, Grant County animal control officer. "But a lot of them still 
need medical care." 
A grand jury indicted the owners of the kennels Wednesday on 33 counts. A 
preliminary hearing has been set for Feb. 25. Additional charges could be filed 
in Pendleton and Harrison counties. 
Ken Sunbom faces 20 counts of animal cruelty, two counts of theft and two 
counts of receiving stolen property. His ex-wife, Tanya Moukedden Sunbom, was 
charged with six counts of theft, two counts of receiving stolen property and 
with being a persistent felony offender. 
Police brought 128 dogs to the shelter after they were discovered last month 
in squalid conditions at kennels operated by the pair. 
Workers neutered all the dogs and updated their shots. 
Each dog had a tracking microchip implanted under its skin. 
Twelve of the stolen dogs have been claimed and returned to their original 
owners, Bedard said.

Checkup: Cole, a 3-year-old Rottweiler mix, has his teeth cleaned while under 
anesthesia by certified veterinary technician Tammy Felmlee, left, as 
veterinarian Kathleen McCloskey monitors the gauges at the Franklin Veterinary 
Associates in Greencastle Tuesday.


Warning signs of periodontal disease: 
Bad breath -- one of the first signs of dental disease. 
A yellowish-brown crust of plaque on the teeth near the gum line. 
Red and swollen gums. 
Pain or bleeding when your pet eats or when the mouth or gums are touched. 
Decreased appetite or difficulty eating. 
Loose or missing teeth. 
Tips for pet dental care 
Begin dental care at home by feeding your pet specially formulated foods that 
help with dental health. 
Schedule regular veterinary checkups to ensure that your veterinarian can 
monitor your pet's dental progress. 
Do not use toothpaste made for humans as it can cause an upset stomach. 
Give your pet appropriate toys to prevent teeth fractures. 
Don't wait for an annual checkup if you suspect a problem.

Brush and floss after every meal, brush your tongue to get rid of bacteria 
and bad breath, then follow up with mouthwash. 
These are some things our dentists tell us to keep our teeth healthy, but 
animals need dental care, too. 
February is National Pet Dental Health Month and advocates say pet owners can 
become more educated on the importance of taking care of their pets' teeth. </docText>

Despite a downturn in the consumption of horsemeat in France, animal welfare 
organisations protest that as many as 850 horses are still eaten each day 
Recent figures showing that the consumption of horsemeat in France has 
decreased hugely over the last two years have failed to pacify horse welfare 
organisations.

The consumption of horsemeat in France was down by 17% in 2002, and slumped a 
further 10% in 2003. There are less than 1,000 horse butchers in the country, 
falling from 1,300 such specialist outlets in 1999.

The decrease in horsemeat consumption in France is considered to be as a 
result of health concerns. Although many people turned to horsemeat during the BSE 
crisis in the late 90s, on the advice of a government veterinary committee, 
horsemeat is now banned from restaurants throughout the country.

But the Ethical Association of the Horse, a welfare organisation which has a 
range of mottos all enforcing the view that a horse ought not to be eaten, 
maintains that as many as 850 horses are still eaten each day in France (as many 
as 310,000 every year).

The association says that the status of the horse has changed and that he has 
become a companion rather than a slave.</docText>

Nutrition expert Dr. Robert Atkins, creator of the high-protein, low-carb 
"Atkins Diet," may have had heart disease when he died.
The Associated Press
Updated: 12:55 p.m. ET Feb. 11, 2004The debate over Dr. Robert Atkins&#x2019; 
high-fat, low-carb diet flared posthumously Tuesday over news that Atkins 
himself weighed 258 pounds at his death &#x2014; though the reasons for his bloated 
condition were immediately disputed.

A physicians group that is highly critical of the diet released details of a 
city medical examiner&#x2019;s report filed after Atkins&#x2019; 2003 death which showed 
the 6-foot doctor was at a weight normally considered obese.

The group claimed the Atkins diet led to weight and heart troubles for its 
72-year-old creator. But his allies countered that he had gained more than 
60 pounds through fluid retention in the eight days he spent in a coma 
before dying last April.

&#x201c;Critically ill patients, when sustained on fluids in the hospital, gain 
weight,&#x201d; said Dr. Stuart Trager, chairman of the Atkins Physicians Council, 
a group affiliated with the Atkins diet empire. &#x201c;He was grossly swollen, so 
much so that his family and associates barely recognized him.&#x201d;

The epochal success of South Korean researchers in cloning a human embryo and 
culling stem cells from it is likely to influence discussion in Japan about 
such studies. 

'It's an achievement that provides great hope for patients suffering from 
serious diseases,' said Shinichi Nishikawa, group director of the Laboratory for 
Stem Cell Biology at the government-affiliated Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research (Riken)(Japan). 

The experiment by scientists at Seoul National University involved a special 
technique to remove the nucleus of an egg taken from a woman and replace it 
with the nucleus from one of her own cells, thus creating genetically identical 
cells. 

The technique may provide a breakthrough in transplant treatment because a 
patient's body would not reject cloned cells. Transplanting cloned nerve cells 
containing a patients' own genes could cure Parkinson's disease or spinal cord 
damage caused by damage to nerve cells. 
But some observers have voiced ethical concerns over cloning, warning that 
cloned embryos could result in a human clone if they were placed in a womb and, 
even if cloned embryonic stem cells were used exclusively for the purpose of 
studies and medical treatment, the embryos themselves from which human life 
starts would be artificially created and destroyed. </docText>

The gorillas need a stag film. 
The lesser flamingos prefer mirrors and showy neighbors. 
The lions, well, they don't require any help at all. 
At the Fort Worth Zoo, animals perform their mating rituals free of the 
romanticism and bad poetry of Valentine's Day. 
The often-mysterious whoopee-making activities of the 435 species at the zoo 
offer a fascinating study of behavior. But the subject is more than a 
curiosity for the keepers and curators, who use breeding to maintain the captive 
population, and in some cases, to act as a hedge against extinction. 
And while old-fashioned animal instinct is a powerful thing, it doesn't 
always lead to a lucky evening. 
Sometimes the keepers must intervene to help nature run its course. In some 
areas of the zoo, however, unchecked randiness has led to a different kind of 
intervention. 
Reproduction is "one of the most interesting parts of biology," said Robert 
Wiese, the zoo's director of animal collections. 
The zoo, along with most other major U.S. zoos, maintains a complex set of 
genealogical records on its animals, particularly on its 39 endangered or 
threatened species. 
It is Wiese's job to cull through the stud books to find mates for animals 
from jaguars and mountain bongos to rhinoceroses and elephants. He tries to keep 
the gene pool as broad as possible by matching animals that are the most 
unrelated genetically. 
"It's almost the opposite of domesticated animals," he said. "Where they're 
trying to breed faster thoroughbreds or more milk production from cows, we try 
not to select for anything." 
But nature is anything but uniform in its approach to reproduction, and so 
the curators and keepers at the zoo must think creatively to satisfy each 
animal. 
Some need space, some need privacy, some need to hibernate, some need a cold 
shower. Sometimes, the keepers just need to make sure they are putting the 
right pair together. </docText>

Dutchess nuzzled my face, breathing sweet, warm air on my cold cheeks, 
tousling my hair. She liked me.
My heart thumped. City girls don't get many chances to snuggle with 
standardbred mares and probably couldn't get this close to an unfamiliar sighted horse. 
Standing under the muzzle of a blind one felt like an intrusion, but Dutchess 
caressed the moment. She indulged me.
``She is an extremely confident horse,'' said Annette Fisher, her rescuer, 
benefactor, ``mom.''
She and I chatted softly so Dutchess could monitor our location. After she 
endured years as a castaway of the animal kingdom, her hooves finally struck 
friendly soil. She has escaped the hatchets of the meat processors not once, but 
twice. ``The fact that somebody would euthanize her because they didn't want 
to care for the horse is amazing,'' said Jana Tuckerman, a vet in equine 
practice. ``It's irresponsible to take a blind mare to the slaughter house.''</docText>

Q. My dog was recently diagnosed with Addison's disease. What is this disease 
and how is it treated?
A. Addison's disease is a condition in which the body no longer produces 
adequate amounts of certain steroids. There are several types of steroids, which 
are primarily produced in the adrenal glands. These particular steroids are 
necessary for pets to handle stress and normal body activities such as nerve 
conduction and muscle contractions. In the case of Addison's disease, the 
inadequate production of steroids results in a dog that can no longer handle the daily 
stresses in life and eventually becomes noticeably ill. Electrolyte 
imbalances primarily affecting sodium and potassium occur. These electrolytes are 
essential for normal nerve activity as well as numerous other cellular functions. 
Potassium can increase to levels that become toxic to the heart.

The Ruckus Society rethinks the U.S. anti-corporate globalization
movement; foregrounds POC leadership, ?anti-oppression analysis?
...
?Close your eyes,? directs a young workshop facilitator. In the sticky
heat of a secluded Florida campground, under a large open-air tent, a
group of activists closes their eyes. ?Now I want you to picture an
anti-corporate globalization activist.? The campers furrow their
collective brows. ?Okay,? says the facilitator, after a brief pause, ?how
many saw a white person??

Over a hundred and fifty activists -- roughly a third of them people of
color -- have gathered in the Florida wetlands from across the hemisphere,
united in opposition to corporate globalization, to participate in a
week-long training camp hosted by the Oakland-based Ruckus Society.
...
The better part of a day was devoted to debate between animal rights
activists (primarily white) and meat eaters (primarily working class and
people of color) after meat was brought into the historically vegetarian
and vegan camp space for the first time, at the demands of many people of
color.

John Taylor, a 25-year-old organizer with the African American
Environmental Justice Action Network in Atlanta, was one of them.

?In America if you have access to resources and wealth you can make a
conscious decision not to eat meat,? says Taylor. ?But if you come from
one of my communities then you eat whatever is given to you, because you
don?t have the luxury to say, ?I don?t want to eat that.?? Taylor, who is
learning puppet construction, political theater, dance, and costume design
as part of the Arts in Action track, also noted that meat is an important
part of many indigenous spiritual traditions. </docText>

Rep. Linda McKee, D-Wayne, is serving her fourth and final term in the
Legislature representing the citizens of House District 79 -- Fayette,
Wayne and Winthrop. She also is an English teacher at Winthrop High
School. Correspondent Tim Guiggey sat down with her recently to discuss
her time in the Legislature.
...
I noticed that many of the bills you've sponsored have to do with the
protection of animal rights. Where does that come from?

I think you may also be referring to the work I did on the snaring of
coyotes. Coyote snaring is inhumane and cruel, and once I saw the
pictures, I saw that snaring had come about really because of politics,
not because of good science. It was an issue that deeply divided the
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department. I talked to several biologists
and came to believe it was something that needed to be stopped. I tried,
but it didn't pass the committee. I decided to write a letter to the
attorney general to find out if our law was actually legal. In my view, it
violated the Endangered Species Act and federal law. They took a couple of
months to consider it and finally wrote me a letter with the finding that
we were indeed in violation of the federal law and were asking that the
snaring of coyotes be stopped. And so for now it has stopped. I'm also
opposed to bear baiting. It has to do with problems between the guides who
take up all the bear baiting sites and other hunters who have difficulty
finding a place to site bait. Bear baiting should end, and I hope it does.
I hope that the people of the state of Maine can see it for what it is.
You don't park a container of old doughnuts and cupcakes and dinky
Twinkies and bread and grease and put it out in the middle of the woods
and feed a bear for a week or so, or a month, and then come along and
shoot it. To me, it violates ... fair chase.

At a recent get-together of 435 members of the Quivira Coalition in
Albuquerque, I visited the future of the grasslands. In a dark bar, I even
met the rancher's worst nightmare: a Buddhist vegetarian.

Yet my glimpse onward filled me with hope. In fact, I'm surprised at how
closely the time-to-come resembles the idealized past.

Besides ranchers and farmers, the conference welcomed vegetarians and
Republicans and Democrats and Libertarians and Buddhists and Catholics and
Mormons. All believe that grazing animals - cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens,
llamas or whatever else eats grass - were perfectly designed by nature to
enhance the native grasses. If the land is healthy, so will be the people
who live there. And the food they raise, whether lettuce or beef, will be
better for consumers as well.

Of course, ranchers love to cuss ignorant environmentalists who don't know
anything about cows. And environmentalists love to curse stupid ranchers
whose cows leave manure in the creek. For 20 years, I've been both a
rancher and an environmentalist, and sometimes I've been embarrassed by my
company.
...
"Well, we meat-eating ranchers may not be Buddhist, but we grew up knowing
that," I answered. Eventually, we shook hands, somewhat amazed by our
agreement. That's how things work in Quivira: utter opposites can discover
how much they have in common.

The Quivira Coalition isn't the only organization working for change
through cooperation, but it's got to be one of the best.</docText>

        <docText>Less than a month after publicly lambasting Mayor
Bloomberg for tarnishing her husband's legacy, the widow of Dr. Robert
Atkins already has a new target in her sights - people who don't eat meat.

"They're like the Taliban. They're the vegetarian Taliban," Veronica
Atkins fumes in an interview with "Dateline NBC" set to air Friday in
conjunction with the last American TV interview with Dr. Atkins before his
death.

"They're nasty. I've seen them. I've been to conventions, and everything
else. They are nasty, nasty people," Mrs. Atkins continues.

Mrs. Atkins was infuriated when the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine - a group that promotes a vegetarian diet - obtained the diet
guru's medical records that showed that he weighed a beefy 258 pounds when
he died. 
...
The president of PCRM says the Atkins people brought this on themselves by
using Dr. Atkins himself as a spokesman for the diet.

"Dr. Atkins used details of his own heart health in a completely
inappropriate way for the sole purpose of promoting his diet," said Dr.
Neal Barnard.

"This absurd claim that Atkins was in great heart health has gone forward,
and it has been simply untrue." 
...
As for Mrs. Atkins' feud with Bloomberg, who called Dr. Atkins "fat" and
suggested he actually died from health problems and not a slip on icy
pavement, Mrs. Atkins says the hatchet is officially buried.

The mayor "created quite a storm," she says, laughing. "But I don't think
he really meant harm." </docText>

        <docText>Colorado Animal Rescue (CARE) rescued 30 cats from a house in 
Parachute Feb. 5, after their owner died.
CARE received a call that afternoon from the Parachute Police Department 
asking for help in rescuing ?a lot? of cats from the home of a man who had died, 
said CARE executive director Leslie Rockey. 
Parachute police found the cats when they discovered the man?s body, said 
Rockey.
?We filled the cars,? Rockey said, and told police, ??Meet us there at 6.??
When Rockey and Heather Martin, a kennel assistant, opened the front door of 
the house, the cats swarmed around them.
?As soon as we walked in they were all there, meowing and crying at us,? she 
said.
?It was a mess,? said Rockey. ?It was a very poor living environment.?
All the cats were sick, some pregnant, and living in their own feces, said 
Rockey.
Rockey and Martin immediately started plucking cats from the floor and 
putting them into the kennels they had brought with them from the Spring Valley 
shelter. 
?I?ve never seen anything like it,? said Martin. ?It was like picking 
apples,? she said of putting the cats in the kennels.</docText>

Both Fraley and Wenum work for the state Department of Fish, Wildlife and 
Parks; Fraley handles community outreach for the agency in Kalispell, and Wenum 
handles the lions.

A few years back, after the record winter of 1996-1997, Wenum's phone 
wouldn't stop ringing. Lions seemed to be everywhere.

They were living under cabins, threatening dogs, stalking around horse 
pastures. They were sniffing out the Kibbles left on Kalispell porches, and they 
were, occasionally, pouncing on pets.

It was all a function of the weather.

That record winter had slowed down the deer, and the lions had grown fat on 
easy prey and winter kill.

But come spring, some 80 percent of the deer were gone, gobbled up by lions 
and bears and wolves and, most of all, by a long, hard winter of deep snow and 
cold weather.



With deer, elk populations up, FWP getting calls on mountain lions in 
neighborhoods

KALISPELL - It's been a while since Erik Wenum's phone jangled with stories 
of mountain lions prowling Flathead Valley neighborhoods.

"But we're getting some reports coming in," said John Fraley. "We though it 
would be a good idea to get the word out."

        <docText>About 150 animal lovers spent Valentine's Day night helping the 
Northampton County SPCA care for the more than 3,000 animals that pass through 
the agency's doors each year. 
Saturday was the second annual "From the Heart" cocktail reception and silent 
auction to benefit the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
shelter in Williams Township. MCS Art Resource Center at 1110 Northampton St. again 
donated its gallery and dining area for the event. 
We asked people to have a heart for the animals and to give some of their 
time and, of course, some donation to the SPCA, which is in dire need of 
funding," said Susan Master, a volunteer and board member with the Northampton County 
SPCA. Her husband is Richard Master, president of MCS Industries. 
Founded in 1913, the Northampton County SPCA is a nonprofit agency 
unaffiliated with any government or national group. About 97 percent of its roughly 
$500,000 budget comes from pet adoption fees, fund raising, memberships and 
contributions, said board of directors President Diane Davison.

They see worrisome similarities between this winter and the winter of 
1996-97, which preceded the last surge of human-lion problems. Lions seemed to be 
everywhere then - living under cabins, threatening dogs, stalking horses. They 
were sniffing out the pet food left on Kalispell porches and, occasionally, 
pouncing on pets. 
That record winter had slowed down the deer, and the lions had grown fat on 
easy prey and winter kill. But come spring, about 80 percent of the deer were 
gone, gobbled up by lions and bears and wolves and, most of all, by a long, 
hard winter of deep snow and cold weather. 
Now, "we thought it would be a good idea to get the word out," Fraley said. 
Wenum said people often make the situation worse. Feeding the deer through 
the winter, for example, attracts the deer, but the deer attract lions. 
"Once you establish a regular feeding regimen, deer movements become 
predictable and the deer are more vulnerable to predation," Wenum said in a FWP 
statement. 
He said people can help him by calling at the first sign of a wild cat that's 
not acting so wild. Lions bold enough to hang around people and their pets, 
he said, are lions that might later cause trouble.</docText>

2/15/04 Valentine's Day makes February the month of love, and when romance 
seems to be blooming everywhere, cats are no exception.

Soon animal shelters will be flooded with stray kittens, as they are every 
spring. 
This year the Santa Barbara County Animal Services Department will be working 
in conjunction with community organizations to keep many kittens from being 
born and to find a safe home for the hundreds of kittens expected to arrive 
this season, which begins mid-March and will taper off around October.

The plan is to take a proactive approach to the kitten season, said community 
outreach coordinator Sara Wall. All three county shelters will be working 
with Catalyst for Cats of Santa Barbara, Volunteers for Inter-Valley Animals of 
Lompoc, and Animal Shelter Assistance Program of Santa Barbara, among others, 
to encourage the public to spay and neuter their pets.

They will also help each other if one office gets overwhelmed. In addition, 
feral cats that are trapped will be fixed, and foster parents will be recruited 
to nurture and train young kittens so that they will be ready to be adopted.

The shelter has a list of foster parents ready, Wall said, but it needs more. 
In any given day, one or two dozen litters can be brought in. Last year about 
six dozen were brought in at the start of the season. The shelter takes care 
of all stray animals, but cats tend to be abandoned more, Wall said. In 
addition, one cat can have many offspring that reproduce exponentially.</docText>

IF YOU think your dog can read your mind, you're right. Because pooches and 
people have kept company for hundreds of generations, Canis familiaris is 
hard-wired to pick up human social cues, a US anthropologist claims.

According to Brian Hare of Harvard University, the insight will help trace 
the evolution of dogs, and may help explain the origins of autism in people and 
point towards possible therapies. 
"The first diagnostic test for autism is the inability to use social cues," 
he said. "Autists are very poor at reading things like eye-gaze or pointing, 
something called joint attention." 
Not so your average mutt, he says. "It looks like dogs evolved an unusual 
ability to read human gestures and cues, and manipulate and predict human 
behaviour. 
"They were selected to do that through domestication," Dr Hare told the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, meeting in Seattle - and he 
has the evidence to prove it. 
In the first two of four studies, Dr Hare and colleagues in Germany and 
Hungary found dogs are better at a test of their ability to interpret social cues 
than even our primate cousins the chimpanzees, and the dog's closest relation, </docText>

If you recognize the cat in these pictures from somewhere other than Milford 
Humane Society, then you should probably be ashamed of yourself. 

     That likely makes you the person who threw her and another beautiful cat 
out during the coldest week of the year. Ironically, this person would barely 
have had time to recycle the Milford Daily News that contained an article 
outlining the dangers of frostbite for animals before throwing the cats out. 

     The cat, a gorgeous calico now called Dayna, was abandoned with an older 
kitten, probably her son from a previous litter. Eventually, they made their 
way into the basement of an apartment building but not before her ears froze. 

     Frostbite is a pretty horrible experience for both people and animals. 
Most people have seen a picture somewhere of people who's skin turns black from 
frostbite and that's pretty much what happened to Dayna's ears. The top half 
turned black as if it had been burnt, then it crumpled like paper. I think 
(and hope) that once it turns black, there's no feeling in it. But once the ends 
of the ears actually fall off, it leaves a raw edge that has to start healing 
all over again. That, I suspect, must hurt. 

     To add insult to injury, she had never been spayed either and gave birth 
to three kittens in the cold. Although somebody did care enough to call the 
shelter, the little ones were too vulnerable in the frigid weather and they had 
already died before Dayna got to Milford Humane. </docText>

Essential to the research process is injecting mice with VCD, a chemical
that induces menopause. Because the experiment uses animals, it
predictably raised concerns in the campus community regarding animal rights.
...
The high quality of modern human life owes much to research involving
animals. Without it, we would still be racked with the same diseases that
beset our ancestors. Animal testing has given us the antibiotics and
vaccinations without which we would not have survived past infancy. Our
knowledge of nutrition and the development of life-saving surgical
techniques such as heart bypass surgery would not be possible without
animal research. Our life expectancy has increased by 20.8 years because
of animal research, according to the Department of Health and Human
Services. The very fact that we breathe is a testament to the benefits of
the clinical use of animals.

By virtue of their ethical standards, some animal rights activists oppose
profiting from animal testing that uses knowledge gained and procedures
developed from it. Ingrid Newkirk, the president and co-founder of PETA,
is noted for saying, "Even if animal research were to produce a cure for
AIDS, we'd be against it." If animal rights activists were to adhere to
this kind of philosophy then, by extension, they would have to denounce
not only current medical research but also all the medicines, procedures
and knowledge from which they have already benefited.

The whole concept of animal rights is not only a misguided issue to
champion, but also presents a problem for the preservation and improvement
of human life.

Animal testing is an ugly fact, but it still is essential.

I'm an upbeat person. At PETA, I'm often referred to as "Bruce Poppins,"
because I tend to ignore the bad and accentuate the good, sometimes a
bit quixotically, I will admit. Basically, I figure that worry and
pessimism are a prescription for burnout, not empowerment. If we lose
our sense of humor and optimism, we're bound to be less effective as
activists. Labor organizer Joe Hill told us that mourning was not an
effective method of change ("Don't mourn. Organize!"), and Emma Goldman
declared, "If I can't dance, I want no part of your revolution." But the
strongest impact on my outlook is the closing song of the best movie
ever made, Monty Python's The Life of Brian: "Always look on the bright
side of life." If you haven't seen this flick, put this article aside
and proceed to the nearest video store.

When I look at the world around me, I am filled with vicarious pain at
the level of suffering in the world, but also with hope at the number of
selfless people working to make it a better place. As I pondered a list
of ten, I came up with about 25 things that give me an amazing amount of
hope, and struggled to limit them. So I decided to confine myself to the
things that have blossomed for me in the past two years.

Vegan Video Brigades
Praise be to Eddie Lama. From Lawrence, Kansas, to Asheville, North
Carolina, to Seattle to San Francisco to Minneapolis to Washington to
more and more cities, activists are showing people how meat is
made-taking TV/VCRs, generators and literature, setting up at metro
stops, outside concerts, at fairs, and so on. To my great delight,
PETA's Meet Your Meat seems to be the video of choice. Of course, PETA
is happy to supply a free two-hour loop to anyone who would like a copy
to show. We also have details of how to do this event on the "Great ways
to promote vegetarianism" link at GoVeg.com. Watch the video, narrated
by actor Alec Baldwin (a sign of hope himself!) at www.MeetYourMeat.com.

Farmed Animals are People Too
Animal behaviorists are finally studying society's most neglected
animals-rats, mice, and farmed animals (chickens, pigs, cows, and fish),
and publishing their findings. So we now know that rats and mice dream,
play, and have a sense of fun, and that chickens, pigs, fish, and cows
are every bit as interesting and intelligent as any dog or cat. In 2003,
The New York Times and The New Yorker both did stories discussing the
fact that chickens score better on cognitive function tests than dogs or
cats, and pigs do even better, showing mental acumen beyond that of a
three year-old human child. We learned that fish have long-term memory
and can use tools, abilities once thought by anthropologists to
distinguish humans from other primates. Once people start to see
chickens, fish, rats, mice, and other animals as interesting and
deserving of respect, some basic protections are sure to follow, and
fewer and fewer people will eat them or torment them in labs.

The Christian Vegetarian Association and Father John Dear, S.J.
There've been Jewish vegetarian groups for years; finally, the religion
that comprises about 90 percent of Americans has a vegetarian group of
its own. The Christian Vegetarian Association's "What would Jesus eat?"
pamphlet (from ChristianVeg.com) is excellent, and can be placed in the
literature area of your nearest Christian church (you don't have to
belong or even be Christian to do this). Similarly, the first piece of
literature by a member of the Catholic clergy to invoke animal cruelty
as a reason to adopt a vegetarian diet, Christianity and Vegetarianism
by Fr. John Dear, S.J., also came out about a year ago (available from
PETA for free to anyone who wants to place them in Catholic churches).

The Doris Day Animal Foundation (DDAF) is encouraging Americans to be 
"PETriotic" by having their pets spayed or neutered to participate in the tenth 
annual SPAY DAY USA, on Tuesday, February 24, 2004. DDAF is the nonprofit organizer 
of Spay Day USA, the national campaign to reduce pet overpopulation that has 
been responsible for altering more than one million cats, dogs, and other 
animals since its inception. 
The public can participate in Spay Day USA by having their pet altered, by 
making a donation or by volunteering at a local event. "Spay Day USA is a 
wonderful example of how individuals and communities across the nation can work 
together to make a difference in the lives of animals and people," said Doris Day, 
DDAF's founder and president. To find the Spay Day USA event nearest you, 
visit www.pets911.com, or call 1-888-PETS-911 (in Spanish and English). 
Animals who have been spayed or neutered usually enjoy better health and make 
more desirable companions than those who have not been altered. In addition 
to benefiting animal guardians and their pets, spay/neuter benefits communities 
by not adding to the number of homeless animals burdening local humane 
shelters and U.S. taxpayers, who pay more than $1 billion annually to deal with the 
problem of pet overpopulation. "Spay/neuter is a PETriotic thing to do," says 
Holly Hazard, DDAF's executive director," because when we take care of our 
pets, we are helping our communities." </docText>

Sale of musical instruments made of skins of lizards, though prohibited by 
law, flourishes at a religious fair held in an Orissa town, say activists.

The instruments are sold at the grand annual religious fair at Joranda, a 
pilgrimage centre in Dhenkanal district, 130 km from here, for followers of the 
Mahima Dharma religious movement founded in 1828. 

There are over half a dozen temples in Joranda dedicated to the movement's 
founder, Mahima Gosain. Every year, people congregate for a fair between January 
and February. 

This year, the five-day festival began last week. Followers of the religious 
group play a musical instrument known as 'khanjani' that is made of a small 
hollow round ring of wood across which skin of a monitor lizard is stretched.

Wildlife activists say at least 5,000 such instruments were sold at this 
year's fair. "At least 6,000 monitor lizards must have been killed for these 
instruments," said an expert who visited the fair.

But wildlife officials deny this. "Every year we patrol the fair and arrest 
the people selling them," district wildlife officer Sashi Pal told IANS.

"This year too our officials are keeping a close watch. We don't have any 
information if anybody is selling the instruments secretly," he said.

But activists claimed most visitors at the fair had the musical instruments 
and wildlife officials were afraid of seizing them or making arrests.

The skins used in the instruments come from two species of endangered monitor 
lizards -- the Indian monitor or varanus bengalensis and yellow monitor 
lizard or varanus flavescens -- that are protected under the Wildlife Protection 
Act of 1972.</docText>

Tens of thousands of animals and plants are being 
driven to extinction as countries fail to meet conservation targets set more 
than a decade ago, U.N. officials warned at a major conference on biodiversity 
that opened Monday. 
 
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, said human 
activities such as logging and overfishing are briskly sending animal and 
plant species to oblivion. 
Countries have failed to meet expectations set by the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ? resulting in a "high scale" of species loss worldwide, 
but especially in the developing world, he said. 
"We have to do more, not simply pay lip service," Toepfer told a news 
conference marking the start of the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the 
Convention on Biological Diversity. 
More than 2,000 government officials, scientists and environmentalists are 
attending the conference, which is an offshoot of the Rio summit that aims to 
promote environmental protection and help developing countries share in the 
wealth created by their natural resources. 
At least 60,000 species worldwide currently become extinct each year, Toepfer 
said, mainly because of the "global development agenda" set by wealthy, 
industrialized nations, which consume most of the globe's natural resources. 
Delegates attending the conference, which runs for nearly two weeks, hope to 
refocus attention on environmental issues at a time when security and trade 
dominate the international agenda. 
Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki said many countries emphasize 
industrialization and economic progress above environmental conservation, threatening 
"a major global ecological crisis." </docText>

Through dramatic but nonviolent protests, Greenpeace has for more than 30 
years brought the world's attention to - and helped reduce - actions that degrade 
the environment. Nuclear testing, seal and whale hunting and toxic emissions 
all have been curbed in the aftermath of Greenpeace efforts to expose their 
deleterious effects on human and animal species. 
But the group's extraordinary worldwide impact could be cut back if U.S. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft has his way. Greenpeace faces unprecedented 
criminal charges that could significantly diminish the group's ability to operate - 
and potentially chill similar protest acts by a wide array of activist 
organizations. 
The case stems from an action by Greenpeace off the coast of Florida related 
to one of its causes, protesting illegal logging. On April 12, 2002, 
Greenpeace activists in small boats pulled up to a cargo ship outside the Port of Miami 
that they believed was carrying a shipment of mahogany illegally exported 
from Brazil. Two members of Greenpeace boarded the cargo ship with the intention 
of unfurling a banner reading "President Bush, Stop Illegal Logging." 
The duo were blocked in their efforts and arrested, along with four other 
protesters. They were charged with interfering with the Coast Guard and illegally 
boarding the ship. They spent the weekend in jail and paid a fine, typical 
punishments for those who practice the long-honored tradition of civil 
disobedience. </docText>

Fur has finally come in from the cold and is once again in hot demand, 
according to the industry.

An object of desire during the money-driven eighties and early nineties, fur 
fell out of favour through a combination of the recession and increasingly 
potent animal welfare campaigners.

The activities of the anti-fur lobby reached a level where anyone with a fur 
coat was afraid to wear it out for fear of public condemnation.

The inevitable result was the closure of fur sections in departments stores 
and a large number of specialist furriers.

However, it appears in the past few years that the pendulum may have swung 
back the other way and that the industry is enjoying something of a renaissance.

The latest evidence comes in new figures from the British Fur Trade 
Association (BFTA) which indicate sales increased by 35% in Britain last year.

Market researchers Mintel said in a report from 1999 there were around 180 
designers using fur, compared to around 40 in 1985 when figures were first 
recorded.

At the forefront of the claimed return to fur have been some the world?s 
best-known fashion houses, such as Dolce &amp; Gabbanna, Gucci, Prada, and Jean-Paul 
Gaultier.

Andrea Martin, from the BFTA, said: ?What has happened over the past few 
years is that designers are looking at fur with a different eye.

?There are so many techniques that can used because it such a versatile 
fabric. For example, you can knit with fur, it can be plucked, or it can sheared so 
it is much more low-weight.

?We are coming away from the image of a long mink coat that you might have 
imagined your grandmother would wear and it is much more up-to-date fashion.

?It is starting on the catwalk and then transferring to the high street where 
consumers are wanting it too.?</docText>

A Bridgetown woman has put her first aid training to a rather unusual and 
unconventional use.
Leonie Armstrong, a Bridgetown pre-primary teacher's assistant, received a 
Certificate of Commendation and a letter from RSPCA chief executive Steve 
Vanstan for resuscitating her dog Tannie when she stopped breathing after an 
accident.
Mrs Armstrong said she did not hesitate to use the skills she learnt as part 
of her senior first aid training, with some improvisation.
The accident occurred in November last year at the family farm near the 
Bridgetown-Boyup Brook Shire boundary.
Mrs Armstrong's husband Ken had taken their two kelpies Tannie and Kell to 
move a flock of sheep up a laneway to a paddock, leaving Mrs Armstrong at home.
Mr Armstrong had directed the two dogs through a fence.
While Kell went under, Tannie leapt over and that's where tragedy struck.
While leaping over the fence, Tannie got her hind leg tangled in the wire.
Mr Armstrong tried to free her but in her pain and confusion Tannie bit Mr 
Armstrong several times on the side of the face.
Fortunately they were close to the house and Mrs Armstrong, attracted outside 
by the barking from Kell, yelping from Tannie and yells for help from her 
husband, rushed to the shed to fetch a pair of pliers.
Mr Armstrong had to restrain Tannie firmly under one arm with his hand 
wrapped around her muzzle while he used the pliers to cut her free.
Upon her release, Tannie collapsed and Mr Armstrong discovered she was no 
longer breathing.

Tracey Woods, who runs the Great British Circus box office, said: "We are the 
first educational circus in the country in that we train our animals in front 
of the public and explain what we are doing.

"We feel in this day and age that we need to make it clear that we treat our 
animals with great care.

"The RSPCA inspects our circus every time we travel to a new venue. There 
have only been five prosecutions against touring circuses in the past 150 years.

"We have also won awards for our animal husbandry from World's Fair magazine, 
which is the circus industry journal.

"Animal rights protesters should concentrate on the owners of domestic pets 
who are up in court every day for cruelty."

CAPS has written to the owners of the Gardens asking them to prevent animal 
circuses using their land in the future.

A spokesperson for the Preston-based pressure group said: "By their very 
nature circuses cannot provide the space and necessary requirements to meet all of 
the complex needs of the animals.

"These animals will be touring the country for the next eight months, just to 
perform to the public for a few minutes. We are asking the public to boycott 
animal circuses and for shop-keepers not to display posters for circuses with 
animal acts.

My parents and grandparents on my mother's side are whole-food advocates. 
They taught me early on about the "four white evils." Do those also apply to dogs 
and cats?

A poacher from a village of Kronshtadka in southern Primorye was fined $4,500 
by the Spassk district court on February 12 for killing an Amur tigress - of 
her two cubs one was later found dead while the other is monitored by 
ecologists in the wild, local news sources reported. 

According to televised reports from the court hearing Vasily Zelenin, 20, was 
sentenced to pay a fine of 130,000 rubles after the court found him guilty of 
slaying a tigress December 7. 

Court officials said that Zelenin, together with his companion, went hunting 
in the forest and spotted the tigress's tracks. Following them he soon saw the 
tigress sitting on the ground and killed her shooting three times from his 
rifle. 

Then Zelenin flayed the animal and hid its head and paws in a beehive in his 
yard. The next day experts from Special Tiger Inspectorate for the Protection 
of Rare and Endangered Species found the killed tigress and her dead cub 
nearby and launched a criminal investigation. Zelenin was detained by local police 
and admitted the crime giving law enforcers the tigress's skin, head and paws 
as well as his rifle and cartridges. Zelenin's advocate told the court that 
poverty caused Zelenin to kill the cat. </docText>

Recent tuition hikes, the unhealthy quality of food, and inconvenient meal
times have forced a number of UMBC students to drop their meal plans
entirely. Director of Wood Company Dining Services, Oscar Berninger,
claimed that "decreases between the fall and spring semester happen at
every campus in the country."

Many students find it makes more financial sense to drop their meal plans
and convert scholarship money, or money intended for meal plans into Flex
dollars. Commuter student Jacqui Medford recently dropped her meal plan
and now only uses flex, but she is still having difficulties affording her
lunches. "Sometimes I won?t eat just because I can?t afford to, and that
is ridiculous. A super-sized meal anywhere else is around four dollars.
Why should we pay six to seven dollars just because we are on campus?
Where did the tuition raise go? Certainly not to [help] us." 
...
A number of students have dropped their meal plans not only because they
cannot afford them, or because they simply do not like the food, but
because they cannot eat it. Vegetarian Kristen Cevoli said, "I dropped my
meal plan this year and decided to cook for myself, mainly because the
options for me were so few, and not very healthy either." For Cevoli,
however, money was also an issue because "it would be cheaper to not pay
for a meal plan
 that way I wouldn?t lose money when I didn?t use all my
meals in a week, which always happened."
...
Although the Commons may not seem to provide extensive meal options for
vegans, vegetarians, and other special diets, Berninger claimed "We have
one of the most comprehensive vegan and vegetarian programs in the
country" in the student Dining Hall. This includes vegan soup of the day,
salads, and prepare-your-own fare at Fresh Choices. Also, Kosher frozen
fare is available at the Spot. But many students who don?t have time to
run to the Dining Hall between classes for lunch wish the Commons could
offer better choices.</docText>

    As a representative voice of more than 85 Cape Cod residents who publicly 
support the graduate students' opposition of the Tufts University School of 
Veterinary Medicine's (TUSVM) bone healing experiment, I would like to share 
with you our perspective on the controversy that recently swept through your 
campus ("Grafton campus community deals with aftermath of controversial animal 
deaths" Tufts Daily, Feb. 9). 
    Just hours before attending a New Years Eve fundraiser for TUSVM's 
Oncology department we learned of the plight of five research dogs with surgically 
broken legs. Prior to hearing the evening news, none of us had scrutinized the 
kinds of research our donations might be supporting. As supporters and patrons 
of a school considered an ethical leader in the humane treatment of animals, 
we had simply taken it for granted that our dollars were being spent on the 
research of naturally occurring disease and injury. After hearing the news we 
immediately began to reevaluate our previous misconception. 
    Although it was learned that the Oncology fundraiser had no apparent 
direct ties to the experiment in question, several attendees continued to express 
concern that their donation's might be diverted to animal research methods 
that they themselves might not agree with. Consequently, the research dogs' story 
prompted us to begin a discussion of our views on the subject of responsible 
animal research. 
    Whereas, we are not all scientists, together we possess extensive 
experience caring for a wide variety of animal species with varying degrees of good 
health, illness and injury. Accordingly, it doesn't take a scientific degree to 
know that it should be possible to measure the healing of canine bones 
through the same methods as are used with humans, or that rehabilitation 
possibilities do exist for two or three legged dogs "bred specifically for research"

A mourning dove in flight is erratic. Sudden changes of direction. Confusing 
dips and turns. 
Ditto for a proposed law to hunt the birds. That legislation, at the 
epicenter of an angst-ridden Senate hearing today, is a springboard for threats, 
protests, political sleight of hand and exhaustive lobbying efforts the likes of 
which haven't been seen since, well, the last time it was proposed. 
"I've been around here 20 years and this is like the eighth time I've fought 
it," said Eileen Liska, lobbyist for the Michigan Humane Society. "It's always 
the same. Wild." 
So when the Senate Judiciary Committee (why is a hunting bill in the 
Judiciary Committee? Stay tuned) convenes at noon today, it will be against a backdrop 
of lobbying chaos and an undercurrent of "animal rights extremists" versus 
"gun-loving nuts" that has colored every dove hunting debate for the past 
several decades. 
If the committee passes the measure, it could go to the full Senate as early 
as Wednesday. 
The House, which approved the bill in November, would need to OK changes made 
in the Senate version before sending it to Gov. Jennifer Granholm. 
Granholm is staying safely in her political bomb shelter unless she's dragged 
out. "When, and if, it reaches her desk, we will decide whether to sign it," 
her spokeswoman, Liz Boyd, said Monday. 
Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, said Granholm, like the 
legislators, sees the issue as a hot potato. </docText>

The 2003 Perry County Animal Control numbers have been totaled and the 
results are bittersweet.
The progress to reduce the number of adoptable animals euthanised at the 
animal control facility has improved in leaps and bounds since Perry County Humane 
Society has stepped in to make a difference.
If you remember from 2002, the total brought in was around 530 and total 
adopted was around 30!
That means the society is saving 43% more animals than the year before. The 
Perry County Humane Society are not the only hard-working individuals that have 
taken part in this endeavor. The Perry County Humane Society would like to 
thank Lonnie James (past Animal Control Officer), Scott Hagene (current Animal 
Control Officer), and Angie Adams (kennel care-taker).
Everyone in Perry County can help in this effort in a few simple ways: 1. 
Spay/Neuter your pets! This is the only way we can assure to lower the numbers of 
unwanted animals that are brought into the facility. It also ensures a 
healthy and happy lifestyle for your animal. This one-time vet expense can save you 
money and time in the long run not having to worry about an unwanted litter. 
2. Support your local Humane Society by either volunteering a couple hours a 
week or by sending donations of money and supplies.</docText>

The Marion County Sheriff's Department also launched an internal 
investigation over the animal-neglect allegations against Deputy Karen Bumgart, RTV6's 
Jack Rinehart reported Tuesday. 

Animal control officers say Bumgart abandoned the cats and didn't leave 
behind food or water for them when she moved out of the west-side apartment. The 
apartment's managers summoned the officers after Bumgart left. 
"These animals cannot feed themselves -- you have to give them food to take 
care of them," animal control Sgt. Jerry Bippus said. "They can't open a fridge 
or cabinets to get food. These animals were left there to fend for 
themselves." 
Officers let RTV6 see the apartment Tuesday. Clothes, boxes and trash were 
strewn throughout the unit. 
Also left in the unit were parts of Bumgart's uniform, including pants, a hat 
and the back side of a bulletproof vest. </docText>

Ellen Shillingburg hadn't thought it was possible to feel road rage on the
dirt roads of rural Garrett County, Md.

But when she saw a black bear crossing the road in front of her farm last
fall, Shillingburg barreled toward it in her Pontiac Grand Am.

"I tried to hit it with my car," said Shillingburg, 75, who said bears
killed dozens of her sheep last year on her Oakland property.

"Are you out of your mind?" her husband yelled at her. "It would ruin your
car."

"Yeah," Shillingburg recalled telling him, "but that would be one less
bear we had to deal with."

Black bears were nearly extinct in Maryland 50 years ago, but times have
changed. Shillingburg's experience highlights the anger and frustration
felt by the many Western Maryland residents who support a state plan to
start a bear hunt this year. 
...
But animal-rights activists are fighting back, accusing Gov. Robert L.
Ehrlich Jr. (R) of caving into pressure from hunters more interested in a
trophy bear-skin rug than in wildlife management.

Those opposed to bear hunting have sent thousands of letters and e-mails
to legislators and the Department of Natural Resources. The Silver
Spring-based Fund for Animals is airing a radio ad that pleads for the
hunt to be stopped.

"Even a limited hunt could jeopardize the future survival of this
population in our state," said Michael Markarian, president the Fund for
Animals. "We don't want trophy hunting for this small population of bears."

I'll just go ahead and say it: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is 
a ridiculous organization. See for yourself at www.peta.org. 

Before I offend you with my callous disregard for the suffering of non-human 
beings, let me insert a quick disclaimer: It is possible that PETA has 
achieved some degree of good in this world, and the organization should be lauded for 
its efforts to ameliorate the plight of animals used for inhumane research or 
other cruel purposes. It is also possible that I fully intend to gloss over 
these improbable saving graces and opt instead to deride PETA for what I see as 
a darkly ironic ethical travesty. 
That said, PETA recently released an "action alert" entitled "Stop Habitat 
for Humanity's War on Wildlife!" The alert reported Habitat for Humanity in 
Greeley, Colo., poisoned approximately 175 prairie dogs on undeveloped property 
purchased by the group to make way for housing. Using poison to dispose of the 
rodents, said PETA, "is extremely cruel ? when baits like zinc phosphide come 
into contact with dilute stomach acids, phosphine is released, causing nausea, 
vomiting, coma and, finally, death from suffocation when the lungs fill with 
fluid." 
PETA then launched an assault on the local Habitat for Humanity organization, 
and Greeley Habitat's director Tom Chagolla agreed to halt the program and 
relocate 100 of the vermin - er, prairie dogs.

Two students established an organization last Friday in an effort to spark 
campus awareness of equine cruelty and gain support for a bill outlawing horse 
slaughter. 

Students Against the Slaughter of Horses (SASH) is dedicated to getting 
students invovled in the movement to prevent the ongoing slaughter of horses in the 
United States for human consumption in foreign countries, said club president 
and founder Amanda Karkula, sophomore in ACES.

"A lot of people don't know where their horses are going when they sell them 
at auctions," Karkula said. "Middlemen, or 'killer buyers,' buy these cheap 
horses for slaughtering companies." 

A slaughtering plant in DeKalb, Ill., is currently under renovation after 
being destroyed by a fire two years ago, Karkula said. If reopened, Caval 
International will be one of three horse-slaughtering plants operating in the United 
States. Two others are located in Texas. 

Thousands of horses are slaughtered each year, Karkula said. There were 
42,312 horses killed in the United States for human consumption overseas in 2002, 
according to United States Department of Agriculture records. That number does 
not include horses that were transported across borders into Canada and Mexico </docText>

In the first action of its kind this winter, 18 bison were captured outside 
Yellowstone National Park on Tuesday and were being tested for brucellosis. 
Those that have signs of the disease will be sent to slaughter and the rest 
will be marked and set free, according to Karen Cooper, a spokeswoman for the 
Montana Department of Livestock. 
The bison, a mix of calves, yearlings and adults, were hazed into a pen just 
before noon Tuesday near Horse Butte, west of Yellowstone. The bison were then 
loaded onto trailers and trucked to another holding pen to be tested for 
brucellosis. 
Cooper said some of the bison had been hazed back into the park on Jan. 28, 
Feb. 5 and Feb. 13. 
"These were some of the same animals. We could not get them back in the park 
so today it was a capture operation," Cooper said. 
Several agencies participated in the capture, including the Department of 
Livestock, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, National Park Service and the U.S. 
Forest Service. 
Through a state and federal bison management plan, government agents haze and 
sometimes capture bison that leave Yellowstone. The plan is intended to 
reduce the risk that bison will transmit brucellosis to cattle in the area. 
Captured bison can be sent to slaughter without testing for the disease when 
the population exceeds 3,000, according to the plan. Park officials estimate 
there are currently more than 4,200 bison in the park. </docText>

New diseases in animals are emerging and more virulent forms of old
diseases are increasing. Epidemics are an intrinsic part of factory
farming and industrial agriculture.

In the UK , more than two million cattle were found to be infected with
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) ? mad cow disease. By August 2002,
133 people had died from the Variant Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (VCJD) ? the
human equivalent of BSE.

In 2001, an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK led to the
slaughter of more than five million animals, costing the government two
billion pounds in direct payment to farmers alone.

The swine fever in Asia led to the killing of millions of pigs. A
newly-emerged nipah strain killed 100 pig farm workers, infected 150 with
non-fatal encephalitis and led to the slaughter of a million pigs to
control the disease. 
...
Industrial farming is a highly inefficient form of production when viewed
from the perspective of animals and humans.

It is efficient only from the perspective of trade and industry which
externalises all environmental and health costs and leaves the planet and
people with the burden of pollution and disease.

According to data from the US itself, it takes 16 kg of grain to produce a
kg of beef. The UK poultry industry states that it takes 1.6 kg of feed to
produce one kg of animal meat of which only 33.7 per cent is edible.

In terms of the feed/food ratio, industrial farming is a negative economy
which consumes more than is produced. </docText>

The Town of Southampton Animal Shelter currently houses over a dozen dogs 
that authorities say cannot be safely placed for adoption due to exhibited 
aggressive behavioral problems that may pose safety risks to adoptees. As many of 
these animals reportedly show little promise of rehabilitation, and are 
occupying finite kennel space, shelter procedure calls for the liquidation of said 
animals. 
Members of the Town Board met last Friday with Southampton Animal Shelter 
Supervisor Donald Bambrick, Public Safety Administrator Cheryl Kraft, and 
Assistant Town Attorney Celia Gilvary to discuss codification of shelter procedure 
into town policy that would allow for the killing of animals with behavioral or 
temperamental problems. The policy is expected to be voted in by simple 
resolution as early as next Tuesday?s Town Board meeting. 
?We?re going to have a written policy that is basically the same thing we?re 
doing right now,? Bambrick said yesterday. 
Typified as a ?no-kill? facility, the town shelter operates under an 
established euthanasia policy that states no adoptable animals will be put to death. 
Dogs deemed unfit for adoption are defined as having behavioral and 
temperamental problems posing a safety hazard, or animals with irreparable injuries, 
hereditary defects or diseases such as canine distemper or canine parvovirus.

Team 4 investigative reporter Jim Parsons delivered the following report
Tuesday on Channel 4 Action News at 5 p.m.

Western Pennsylvania consistently ranks poorly in national obesity
studies. And we all know that obesity starts in childhood.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 80 percent of the nation's schools
serve lunches that have more fat and saturated fat than is allowed by the
government's own limits, so Team 4 tracked down the numbers for fat
content in local school lunches.
...
Federal law requires schools to keep fat content at or below 30 percent of
total calories. Saturated fat must be at or below 10 percent of calories.
But most school districts in Allegheny County fail to meet those
requirements, according to the most recent inspections by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education.
...
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington, D.C., is
a different kind of advocate: a pro-vegetarian group that grades school
districts around the nation on the nutritional content of their lunches.

Team 4 asked PCRM to grade 10 randomly selected school districts in
Allegheny County.

Keller: "They could all be doing better."

PCRM looked at menus over a two-week period. They handed out Ds and Fs to
all 10 school districts. A major factor in those grades was the districts'
failure to pass their latest state fat-limit inspections.

All 10 districts claimed that they have come into compliance with the fat
limits since their last inspection, so PCRM gave the districts the benefit
of the doubt and issued a new report card. Instead of Ds and Fs, most of
the grades were changed to Bs and Cs.</docText>

Taiwan needs sound regulations on butchering chickens, as half of all 
domestic chickens were killed in traditional markets under unhygienic conditions, 
environmental and animal rights activists said yesterday in the wake of the 
avian-flu outbreak. 
Dozens of activists yesterday delivered a petition to the Control Yuan, 
asking for an investigation into governmental agencies in charge of public health 
and agricultural products. Activists performed a skit of the Executive Yuan 
failing to supervise its subordinates to prevent avian flu.
"The hygiene required when butchering chickens could not be stressed more at 
this point, where we are exposed to the potential spread of avian flu," said 
Chen Yu-min (??????), director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan.

Last week I talked about the problem with our Blacktail Deer populations. 
Oregon and other western states have been seeing a downturn in Mule Deer also for 
some time now also. There have been all kinds of theories as to why this is 
going on. Urban sprawl and lose of habitat are big ones and often given as the 
cause. Each state has an organization that is in charge of fish and wildlife. 
Here is the problem. 
Most organizations started out as departments of fish and game. The other 
animals were not regulated by these agencies. Then when the environmentalists 
found out how much money was going to these organizations because they were 
funded by people who were hunters and fisherman they found a way of tapping into 
this money. They caused a name change to wildlife and gave these organizations 
the responsibility for all critters. This started to strap these organizations 
for funding. Predators were listed as game animals and controlled. This was 
the beginning of the end.
Here in Oregon there was new and inventive ways of getting more money. The 
money for licenses and tags wasn't enough any longer, so more tags were offered 
for the female game animal, (doe deer and cow elk). This along with the fee to 
just apply for these tags brought in more money. The federal tax for firearms 
and other sporting supplies brought in more and more money from the federal 
government, however there was requirements that this money be applied to other 
than game animals and newly listed game animals. Now it is almost impossible 
to get enough money to study game animals and the problems of predation that 
surround them. When any agency attempts to do a study on predators and the 
effect they are having on game animals the enviro-nuts file suits in court to stop 
them. They know this is their Trojan horse to stop all hunting, and it is 
working like never before.</docText>

right enumerated, and regulated, in the myriad of laws that govern hunting and 
fishing. And forget, for a moment, that nobody is working to take those rights 
away. And forget, for a moment, that such an amendment is superfluous, at 
best, and an incredible waste of time and energy, at worst. 
Yet, sportsmen?s organizations are pushing for the amendment. 
Why? 
Sportsmen?s groups cite a shadowy conspiracy of animal rights activists who, 
they claim, are trying to infringe on the rights of hunters and fishermen, 
even though mainstream animal rights activists say they are trying to accomplish 
no such thing. 
Certainly, animal rights activists have their agenda, and most of it is 
focused on stopping only the most inhumane and cruel practices ? things such as the 
former Hegins pigeon shoot, an activity that cannot be confused with hunting. 
As it is, without the constitutional amendment, hunting in Pennsylvania is 
very healthy. Pennsylvania is behind only Texas in the number of hunters. Last 
year, some 1 million deer hunters took to the woods and bagged an estimated 
500,000 deer. 
There is no concerted effort to stop that. 
If anything, a right-to-hunt amendment could create all sorts of unintended, 
and dangerous, consequences.</docText>

Five Alaskans have been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of 
illegally killing black bears for their gallbladders and other parts prized by 
buyers in Asia, the U.S. attorney for Alaska said Thursday. 
The five suspects, all from Anchorage, were involved in two apparently 
unrelated conspiracies that resulted in at least 14 black bears being taken in 2002 
and 2003, federal authorities said. 
Federal and state law enforcement agencies, meanwhile, are investigating 
other poaching cases involving as many as 50 other black bears in the state, 
according to U.S. Attorney Timothy Burgess. 
Burgess and other officials Thursday declined to give any details about those 
other 50 bears and who might be under investigation.</docText>

Living with humans for hundreds of generations has altered the cognitive 
abilities of domesticated dogs, according to new research by Harvard University 
anthropologist Brian Hare. He reported these findings in Seattle this week at 
the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
His new work provides direct evidence that dogs' lengthy contact with humans 
has served as a selection factor, leading to distinct evolutionary changes," 
says Hare, who recently completed his Ph.D. in anthropology in Harvard's 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. "This is the first demonstration that humans play an 
ongoing role in the evolution of canine cognition."

Hare has shown previously that domesticated dogs are far more skillful at 
reading human communicative signals -- such as glances or pointing -- than either 
a close human relative, the chimpanzee, or a close dog relative, the wolf.
Hare's latest research involved New Guinea Singing Dogs, a subspecies that 
shows strong indications of domestication at some time in the past but now 
exists as feral, reclusive individuals in the highlands of New Guinea. These dogs, 
related to dingoes, have gone without significant human contact for at least 
the past 6,000 years, and little is known about their behavior in the wild.</docText>

        <docText> People will be able to adopt dogs that were rescued from a 
trailer that belonged to the co-owners of a closed pet store.   After a hearing 
on Wednesday morning, Greene County Associate Circuit Judge Mark Powell gave 
official custody of 11 dogs to the Southwest Missouri Humane Society, clearing 
the way for their adoptions. 
   The Humane Society is getting ready for hundreds of applications from 
people eager to adopt the formerly neglected dogs.  The dogs won't be available 
for a few days because the Humane Society set up a special system to make sure 
they all get good homes.  It?s different than the Humane Society?s usual 
adoption process.
   County and state workers took 14 dogs from a trailer home north of 
Strafford on Feb. 2.  Most of them are adults and likely were not for sale at Puppy 
World, which used to be on Ingram Mill Road just north of Sunshine Street.  
Machelle and John Martin owned Puppy World until state officials ruled the 
Martins didn?t provide adequate care for puppies at the store and revoked Puppy World
?s license to sell dogs on Jan. 28.  Officials found few, if any, of the 
puppies that were for sale at Puppy World.  They hope the Martins returned them to 
their breeders.  The dogs at the trailer may have been used for breeding. 
   The Martins each face 14 charges of animal abuse in Greene County because 
of the dogs found at the home.  Animal Control workers say the dogs were 
living with piles of feces and had no food and water.  Eleven were inside the 
trailer.  The day after the rescue, one was returned to its rightful owner.  Humane 
Society officials say another is potentially too dangerous to be put up for 
adoption now and a third is too badly injured or sick to be adopted now.  Both 
may be available for adoption later. </docText>

Mad cow disease must now be considered "indigenous to North America," and
the United States can no longer consider its first mad cow "an imported
case," says an international scientific panel advising the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA). At a USDA public hearing in Riverdale, Maryland on
Wednesday, the five member panel said that while the dairy cow found to be
infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Washington state
last December was imported from Canada, it probably was not the only one.
"It is probable that other infected animals have been imported from Canada
and possibly also from Europe," the panel warned. "These animals have not
been detected and therefore infective material has likely been rendered,
fed to cattle, and amplified within the cattle population, so that cattle
in the U.S. have also been indigenously infected." Their report advises
that United States should test many more cattle, implement the rapid
screening tests for BSE used in Europe, and exclude brain and spinal cord
material from all human and animal food, including pet food. 
...
Said Michael Hanson, a scientist with Consumers Union, the organization
that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, "There's plenty we don't know.
But the USDA takes the science that will cause the beef industry the least
trouble and basically ignores the rest." Sleep well. </docText>

Common Courage Press has just released the first paperback version of our
1997 book Mad Cow USA, the book that predicted the emergence of the deadly
human and animal dementia disease in the United States. When Mad Cow USA
was first published in November 1997, it bore the subtitle, "Could the
Nightmare Happen Here?" We used a question mark because we thought mad cow
disease was possible but still preventable in the United States, if the
meat industry and government regulators adopted adequate safety measures.

Our book received favorable reviews at the time from some interesting
publications such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, New
Scientist, and Chemical &amp; Engineering News. Otherwise, it went largely
ignored and unheralded. It sold briskly but briefly during the infamous
Texas trial of Oprah Winfrey for the alleged crime of "food
disparagement," and then slid into obscurity until December 2003, when the
"nightmare" in our subtitle arrived and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann
Veneman announced that mad cow disease has been found in the United States. 
...
The United States must be made to follow the lead of the European Union
nations, ban all feeding of slaughterhouse waste to livestock, and test
millions of cattle for mad cow disease. In the meantime, if you want
American beef that has been grown in a safe manner, search out products
that are certified organic.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is intensifying its campaign 
against Columbia. Undaunted by what they see as an unresponsive administration, 
activists from the organization continue to protest what they call "grotesque 
abuses to animals" in laboratories at Columbia. 
The organization has been mobilized against the university since late 2002 
when veterinarian Catherine Dell'Orto came to PETA with descriptions of abuse in 
Columbia's labs.
According to Mary-Beth Sweetland, director of research and investigations at 
PETA, Dell'Orto recently had a meeting with members of an investigative 
committee at the University to address her concerns.
PETA was unsatisfied with the outcome of this meeting. "It was, as far as 
we're concerned, a farce," Sweetland said.
The organization has been busy in the past months trying to bring the issue 
to the attention of alumni, writing letters and sending copies of a videotape 
to the Alumni Regional Offices that shows images of mutilated, caged baboons 
said to be from the Columbia labs.</docText>

A small falcon trapped in the press box at Greyhound Arena gave biologist 
Tony Gennaro a frightened stare as he tried to coax it to safety on Wednesday 
afternoon. 
Talking gently to the bird as if it were a scared 6-month-old child, Gennaro 
was able to corner and catch the male American Kestrel Falcon with his hands. 
Gennaro said the bird, which has been flying around the Eastern New Mexico 
University arena since last Thursday, is doing fine and is surprisingly 
energetic. 
It will be cared for by a student and released on Friday, Gennaro said. 
?It?s amazing; I didn?t think they could go that long without food. But he?
s doing great. He seems to be eating, he?s resting and hopefully he?ll be OK,?
 said Gennaro, a professor emeritus with ENMU?s biology department. 
Gennaro and Dawn Davis, a biologist with the Department of Game and Fish, 
first tried to capture the bird with a small mouse trap and a small white mouse. 
After the trap failed to work properly, Gennaro slowly approached the bird 
and calmly caught it with his hands. </docText>

Dear all you activists out there. There are a couple of festival 
stalls coming up that will be needing a few helping hands..... 

If you are interested and you are DEFINITELY available on the 
dates to follow - no last-minute drop outs please - then email the 
dates you are able to help, to the following email address - 
oink@animal-lib.org.au 

These festivals usually only allow a certain number of helpers - 
usually two or three, so you should get in fast if you are really 
interested in being there to help out. 

The first stall is at the 'Two Tribes' Festival at the Sydney 
Showgrounds on Saturday the 6th March. Starting time is 
unknown as yet. Apparently this is an all-night festival so you will 
have to be prepared to go all night! These festivals are usually 
very exhausting as you are on the go all the time (make sure you 
bring a chair) talking to people, selling goods, getting people to 
sign petitions, and making sure the Animal Liberation stall is 
presentable and helpful. 

The second stall coming up is called 'Shoreshocked', it's on 
Saturday, March the 27th at St Leonards Park. Starting time is 
unknown as yet. This will be an all-day festival and will be just as 
exhausting as the all nighter above. You usually start early and 
finish very late. 

As mentioned above, if you are definitely available and willing to 
spend a whole day/night at an Animal Lib stall helping to spread 
the word of what we do, along with raising some much needed 
money. 

If you don't get on the stall this time, your name will be kept for 
future stall dates, so only dedicated stall helpers need sign up. 

Thanks !!!

LOBSTER CRUELTY'S CHILLING END
By Rachel Morris and Viva Goldner

IT MAY be a point of debate among scientists around the world, 
but the RSPCA is certain that lobsters and crabs feel pain and 
deserve a better death than to be boiled alive.

Under guidelines released yesterday, the RSPCA recommends 
that a crustacean die by first being put to sleep in a fridge or 
freezer, then spiked in the brain, before the final plunge into the 
bubbling pot.

The guidelines are intended for restaurants, caterers and home 
cooks.

However, the "new" guidelines have been common knowledge 
among anglers and chefs for years, with fishermen using the 
method to stop lobsters and crabs throwing off their claws when 
being boiled while conscious.

Sarah Langley, from Nick's Seafood Restaurant at Cockle Bay 
Wharf, said it was known throughout the restaurant trade that 
immersing the lobster in water affected the taste. 

"Our chefs have been putting them to sleep in the freezer forever 
- it is standard practice," Ms Langley said.

The RSPCA previously recommended that lobsters, crabs and 
other shelled sea creatures be immersed in a slurry - a mixture 
of ice and water - to chill them and make them oblivious to their 
fate.

Some restaurants skipped this, instead plunging the creatures 
straight into boiling water because some diners complained that 
dunking in a slurry detracted from the flavour.

According to the RSPCA, the slurry causes osmotic shock, which 
is when an animal's cells burst as they absorb too much water.

Under the new guidelines, crustaceans should be chilled in a 
refrigerator or freezer. They should then be killed by splitting, or 
spiking, the brain just before boiling.

RSPCA research scientist Caleb Gardner said recent studies 
had revealed that even crustaceans feel pain.

The guidelines were formulated by a National Scientific Advisory 
Panel and experts in marine zoology.

RSPCA Australia President Hugh Wirth said it was recognised 
that fish, lobsters and crabs could feel pain.

"If you chuck a live crustacean into a boiling pot of water, they feel 
that and you are killing them cruelly," he said. 

However, that question is still hotly debated by scientists, with 
some saying crustaceans and fish do not possess the brain and 
nerve structures to feel pain in any form recognisable to 
humans.

BIRD FLU TOLL RISES TO 22 

From correspondents in Bangkok 

THE toll in Asia's bird flu crisis rose to 22 today with Vietnam and 
Thailand each announcing the death of a young boy, as several 
nations battled new outbreaks of the deadly virus.

A Thai health ministry spokeswoman said that tests showed a 
four-year-old boy from north-eastern Khon Kaen province who 
died on February 3 was the seventh person in the kingdom to be 
killed by the virus. 

And in Vietnam a doctor in Lam Dong province said a 
three-year-old boy who died early today had tested positive for 
the deadly H5N1 virus. 

The countries are the only ones to have confirmed human 
infections of the virus, which has been reported in poultry in eight 
other Asian nations. 

However, health authorities in Indonesia have launched an 
investigation into whether a 55-year-old man who died in 
hospital on Monday had eaten chicken infected with bird flu. 

As more cases broke out in Thailand, China and Japan this 
week, the United Nations warned Asia's bird flu crisis was far 
from over and that nations should not set timelines to declare 
themselves free of the virus. 

Japan's plans to announce this week that its bird flu woes were 
over were dashed yesterday when it confirmed a second 
outbreak, just before China reported two new confirmed cases in 
central Hunan province. 

The discovery prompted Japanese officials today to begin 
inspecting farms housing some 6.8 million birds near the 
southwestern prefecture where bird flu was detected in bantams 
raised as pets. 

A ban on shipment of poultry and eggs within a 30-kilometre 
radius of the infected site was also imposed, officials said. 

Thailand had also been on the brink of declaring its crisis over 
and beginning to rebuild its devastated $US1.2 billion ($1.51 
billion) poultry export business before announcing on Monday 
that bird flu had re-emerged in poultry in nine provinces. 

Thai officials have warned they expect more cases to be 
confirmed when the results of the latest round of testing are 
announced on Friday - after the close of the stock market which 
has been buffeted by the unfolding crisis. 

Deputy agriculture minister Newin Chidchob said revelations 
that bird flu had re-emerged in 14 zones were gleaned from 
2000 samples taken nationwide, and that the results of another 
8000 samples would bring more bad news. 

Newin blamed the new outbreaks on breeders of fighting cocks, 
whom he said fled infected regions with their valuable birds 
instead of slaughtering them. 

The World Health Organisation warned last week that Thailand 
risked triggering a second outbreak of bird flu by lifting 
quarantine zones too hastily. 

A cull of more than 80 million chickens has so far failed to 
contain the outbreak which has hit Cambodia, China, Indonesia, 
Japan, Laos and South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, with 
weaker strains in Taiwan and Pakistan. 

Singapore today carried out a practice cull of 5000 chickens at a 
privately owned farm which authorities said showed the city-state 
was prepared to deal with any outbreak of bird flu. 

The chickens - healthy hens which can no longer lay eggs - were 
stuffed in heavy-duty bags and suffocated with carbon dioxide 
before being disposed of in an incinerator. 

The United Arab Emirates meanwhile today became the latest of 
a host of countries to ban the import of live poultry and birds from 
China due to concerns over bird flu. 

The UAE, which acts as regional trade hub for goods flowing 
from Asia to the rest of the Middle East and Europe, has already 
slapped a similar ban on live birds and eggs from Cambodia 
and Laos.

CONCERNS GROW OVER ANIMALS BURIED ALIVE ENMASS

Press Release: World Society for the Protection of Animals 

Concerns grow over animals buried alive in mass graves 

International charity the World Society for the Protection of 
Animals (WSPA) has received worrying reports from its Asian 
member societies and other sources about the inhumane ways 
in which poultry are killed during efforts to deal with the avian flu 
outbreak. 

These reports include chickens often buried alive in mass 
graves in countries across Asia; in South Korea and Vietnam, 
tens of thousands have been beaten with iron bars or sticks 
before being buried; chickens in China have been set on fire 
whilst still alive and, in Taiwan, chickens have been poisoned 
and then buried. 

Millions of poultry have already been handled and slaughtered 
with little regard for their welfare. The international bodies 
responsible for handling this outbreak, FAO (UN's Food &amp; 
Agriculture Organisation), OIE (World Animal Health 
Organisation) and WHO (World Health Organisation), have so far 
neglected to address the issue of animal welfare.

NEW FORM OF 'MAD COW DISEASE'

From correspondents in Washington 

ITALIAN researchers have discovered a new form of the prion 
believed to cause mad cow disease, according to a study just 
released.

Prior to this new study, only one prion had been found to cause 
the deadly bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) found in 
cows and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) killing humans, 
according to the study published in the Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences. 

An Italian team headed by Salvatore Monaco of the GB Rossi 
Polyclinic in Verona, Italy found the new prion variant in the 
brains of two of eight Italian cows that tested positive for BSE. 

The two cows' brains were not poked with holes as in typical 
BSE cases, however. 

The scientists found instead an accumulation of amyloid 
plaques and that different parts of the brain were affected. 

The new prion is similar to the one found "in many sporadic 
cases of the human disease (CJD)," according to the study's 
news release.

They burned a mountaintop restaurant in Vail. They released mink from a
farm in Pennsylvania. They defaced SUVs in Richmond.

And now, members of the Earth Liberation Front-- ELF-- have taken aim at a
controversial shopping center site in Charlottesville.

Developer Wendell Wood knew there was opposition to his Hollymead Town
Center project. And he'd heard of the group that vandalized 30 SUVs in
Richmond.

But he didn't think opponents of Target's future home would go so far as
to torch two trucks and a piece of heavy equipment on the Rt. 29 site of
his Town Center, and leave a banner boasting, "Your construction =
long-term destruction-- ELF." 
...
The FBI puts ELF at the top of its list of domestic terrorists, and
categorizes its followers as "special interest terrorists," much like the
Animal Liberation Front. The Charlottesville attack has been turned over
to the FBI.
...
Wood calls himself an environmentalist-- "believe it or not"-- and asks,
"This is the sort of person who represents me?"

The sabotage will not slow the completion of Hollymead Town Center, he
says. Rain has been more of a problem for the approximately $400 million
project, but the Target and other stores are still scheduled to open in
the spring of 2005.

"Obviously" says Wood, he wishes he'd already put a guard on the 163-acre
property. "There will be now. If they come out there again, they better
have a bulletproof vest." </docText>

Across Iraq and Kuwait, U.S. troops are rescuing beaten, starving and 
homeless dogs, lavishing them with TLC and crediting the mutts with making their long 
months at war bearable, even joyful at times. A common refrain from soldiers 
is that the dogs are the best things that happened to them at war, providing 
as they do an incalculable morale boost for entire units. 
When a mongrel puppy wandered into his tent last fall, one Army sergeant said 
the effect was immediate and jarring. "When I saw him, I smiled. ... I smiled 
so big and I realized that I haven't smiled in 5 months," the sergeant wrote 
on a Web posting from Iraq. 
At least two-dozen soldiers have become so attached to their canine comrades 
that they have wangled a way to bring them back to America, aided by a 
remarkable civilian volunteer effort in the United States, Europe and the Middle East 
that helps with logistics and costs. 
But the military forbids transporting pets from Iraq, and soldiers now report 
the brass is cracking down, calling for the enforcement of "General Order 
One," a long-standing military prohibition against even feeding or caring for 
animals, much less adopting them. Concern for the safety and health of the troops 
is the rationale. 
On top of that, the primary route for spiriting the U.S.-bound animals out of 
Iraq - 10 hours by road across the western Iraqi desert to Jordan- is now 
shut. Worried about health risks, the Jordanian government is refusing to allow 
any more dogs in, even though the animals are there only temporarily, remain 
confined and have clean bills of health.</docText>

Bridgeport Cat Project volunteer Gilda Caserta sets up a trap designed to 
catch feral cats huymanely so they can receive medical treatment.


"Ferus," the Latin word for "wild, uncivilized, fierce," is the root of the 
English word "feral."

Volunteers from the Bridgeport Cat Project (BCP) are dedicated to alleviating 
the suffering these cats must endure because owners have abandoned them or 
because they were born in the wild to feral mothers.

"I hate cruelty and neglect of every kind," said Wendy Brown, BCP president, 
a former Bridgeport resident who now lives in Milford. "We humans are 
responsible for all the living things on earth."

Brown and more than 20 other volunteers, mostly women, have raised enough 
money to spay or neuter about 5,000 cats through the BCP since 1994.

The group was founded with a $5,000 grant it used to purchase humane traps, 
carriers and nets, and to pay to have wild cats fixed and inoculated. The BCP 
is part of the national Alley Cat Allies organization and aims to lower the 
city's feral cat population.

The estimated millions of unwanted and homeless cats born in the United 
States every year only live an average of 2 to 3 years. Most are born in the spring 
or fall.

Their shortened lifespan - much shorter than that of domesticated cats - is 
due to early death caused by disease, automobiles, dogs, wild animals and human 
abuse.

People urged not to feed them 
Sure, living in the woods during a winter when there's been more than 71 
inches of snowfall can be uncomfortable. 
It can be tough. 
But it doesn't have to be fatal. 
Even though there's been continuous snow coverage on the ground since the 
first week of December - sometimes deep snow with an icy crust on the surface - 
Pennsylvania Game Commission personnel are not reporting significant 
winter-related mortality among the Commonwealth's wild animals and birds. 
"Wildlife are built to handle these types of winters. They are, for the most 
part, able to survive," said Jerry Feaser, the game commission's press 
secretary. 
Mel Schake, the game commission's information and education supervisor for 
southwestern Pennsylvania, said wildlife conservation officers in his region 
have found a couple of deer that apparently died of broken bones and other 
injuries sustained in falls on icy hillsides. And Indiana County's wildlife 
conservation officers reported that four deer died when they fell through the ice 
covering the Mahoning and Little Mahoning creeks. 
But game commission personnel are not seeing widespread evidence of animals 
and birds starving. 
"As tough as it seems, it's not negatively impacting wildlife," Schake said.</docText>

  The drive to secure a British ban on live exports of horses, ponies and 
donkeys took a major step forward yesterday with signs of support from the 
European Commission.

South West Tory MEP Neil Parish is hopeful that his lobbying for a British 
ban on live exports could be successful.

Mr Parish has persuaded Dutch MEP Albert Maat, who is putting forward 
legislation on the transport of animals within the European Union, to include an 
amendment which would maintain Britain's "minimum values" legislation.

This protects low value horses, ponies and donkeys from the horror of live 
transport by pushing their value just above the meat value of the animals, so 
that they will not be transported live for slaughter.

Last night Mr Parish said his call for the minimum values ruling to stay in 
place had received a positive reception.

"It would be silly to say we have achieved a ban, but this is very positive 
news," he said.

"We are a long way down the road to getting the right legislation. I got some 
very positive answers from the European Commission about the derogation."

His optimism that the ban on live exports can be retained comes only a few 
weeks after Defra Minister Alun Michael, who has described himself as "Minister 
for the Horse", sparked outrage by refusing to lobby the EU on the matter. Mr 
Michael said he would not push the EU to close the loophole which would end 
the British ban on live exports.</docText>

        <docText>If doctors had to identify the deadliest sin affecting
Americans today, they probably would name gluttony as the No. 1 killer.

As obesity in the United States reaches epidemic proportions, with more
than 60 percent of adults overweight or obese, public-policy makers and
health officials are scrambling over ways to improve the American diet.

But Don Colbert, physician and nutritionist, thinks the obesity crisis
could be solved if Americans would pause before inhaling a super-sized
fast food meal and ask themselves a simple question: "Would Jesus eat this?" 
...
And Colbert's not the only Christian diet guru urging people to ask what
Jesus would eat. Christian advocates of vegetarianism say if Jesus were
alive today, he would maintain a plant-based diet out of compassion for
animals.

Others say Jesus would approve of genetically modified food, given his
propensity for transforming and multiplying food.

Although there may be disagreement over what Jesus would choose given the
option of a veggie burger, broiled lamb with garbanzo beans, or
genetically modified corn on the cob, growing numbers of Christians are
looking to the Bible for dietary guidance, hoping Scripture might succeed
where science has failed in inspiring healthy eating habits.

Stephen Kaufman, co-chair of the Christian Vegetarian Association, hopes
more Christians will start making faith-based choices about what they eat. </docText>

The report, based on information provided by chief brand board investigator 
Jerry Derr of Rapid City, says brand inspectors falsified brand inspection 
documents.

That allegation centered mostly on a practice called "chuting" cattle, 
although the report refers to it as "shooting" cattle. The attorney general's office 
wasn't sure of the correct spelling on Thursday.

In any case, Reed said "chuting" is done not to hide anything but to speed 
shipment of cattle after a sale.

Here's how the process works.

When cattle are brought to a sale barn, a state brand inspector makes a 
record of each animal, its brand and its owner.

After the sale, a brand inspector fills out a market clearance form listing 
each animal, its buyer and its brand. That practice should be followed whenever 
cattle are sold to a feedlot, Reed said.

But state officials said inspectors often cut corners on the market clearance 
form when the cattle sold are going right to a slaughterhouse. Loads of 
cattle sold for slaughter are usually from many different herds and carry many 
different brands.

Writing down each slaughter cow's brand would add hours to the shipping 
process, Reed said.

"They want to get those cows out of those pens, get them on trucks and get 
them to slaughter."

So inspectors write down the exact number of cows in the shipment but record 
only a sampling of the brands.

"Nobody is ever going to look at those brand papers again," Reed said. 
"They're going east to a slaughter plant."

Reed said the "chuting" practice was in use when he became a brand inspector 
in South Dakota in 1960 and has been widespread and accepted since.

However, the attorney general's report insisted that "chuting" results in 
inaccurate or incomplete market clearances to cattle buyers. The practice makes 
it difficult and, in some cases, impossible to track title for individual 
cattle, the report said.

Reed said if there is any question of ownership, the brand record for each 
cow is still on file at the sale barn.

Reed said that before Derr's investigation, he thought chuting was legal. He 
still isn't convinced it is illegal but has ordered all inspectors to stop the 
practice.

Reed also disputed other allegations in the report and in statements by state 
officials:

n Long said the inspection system failed to discover at least half a dozen 
instances of cattle theft.

Reed said that charge originated from an incident at the Philip Livestock 
Auction in which seven or eight stolen cattle were sold and later discovered in 
Montana.

At the time, investigator Derr said he was troubled that stolen cattle with a 
registered brand and no proof of ownership could be sold within the West 
River Ownership Inspection Area.

But Reed said the sale barn and inspectors there followed proper procedure, 
requiring the seller to sign an affidavit showing where he had bought the 
cattle. That paper trail helped trace the cattle and prosecute the thief, Reed said.

Reed said he didn't know of other thefts the state report mentioned.

n The report said some brand inspectors illegally kept money from "local" 
inspections, those done at ranch sales. "That is bogus," Reed said. He said money 
from local inspections comes into his office. An inspector who embezzled 
inspection fees about 14 years ago was prosecuted and jailed.</docText>

Tom and Jeanne Foley of Dawsonville have trained their bichon fris?, Beau, to 
sleep in their bed when they want ? and to leave when they want some alone 
time. Tom bought Jeanne a stuffed animal that looks like Beau for Valentine's 
Day. It's estimated that almost 6 in 10 small dogs share their owners' bed.
 

Even then, they're not totally alone ? the dog, Ozzy Osbourne, still presses 
his nose underneath the door and whines and scratches until the doting owners 
give in and open it.
 
"It's a big romance killer," said 56-year-old Cole, who recently planned a 
weekend getaway in the Georgia mountains. "We decided to go away for Valentine's 
Day to get away from the animals, to have some affection and sex."
 
Dogs, cats and other furry animals are creating a wedge between couples 
across the country as pets move inside the home ? and the bedroom ? in record 
numbers. Like a toddler, or even worse, a photo of your mother-in-law, a pet in 
bed tends to dampen desire.
 
A 1988 survey showed that two-thirds of dogs slept indoors, according to the 
American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. By 2002, 78 percent of dogs 
spent at least some of the evening under the same roof as their owners.</docText>

In addition to supervised probation, Peplin-Sobelman must pay about $26,000 
in restitution to the Humane Society, which paid for the care of animals 
rescued from the breeding operations. Peplin-Sobelman will not be allowed to breed 
animals again or keep more than three house pets, said St. Francois County 
Prosecuting Attorney Wendy Horn. 

Horn called the case "a horrible crime" and "the most egregious case of 
animal abuse" she has ever seen. 

In February 2002, police found 26 living and eight dead cats in a trailer 
owned by Peplin-Sobelman. Investigators said the animals were left unattended for 
weeks. Many survived by drinking melted snow that leaked through the 
trailer's roof and by eating one another. Three of the rescued cats later died from 
diseases associated with malnutrition. 

Weeks later, police discovered an unlicensed dog-breeding facility operated 
by Peplin-Sobelman. There, authorities found 155 dogs and seized 30 animals 
suffering from ailments often associated with neglect. 

Dan Paden, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said 
the sentence "would be laughable if it was not so abhorrent."

        <docText>Dull days are over for badger and bobcat alike at Living Desert 
Zoo and Gardens State Park.

On Sunday, toys will be placed in the exhibits of many of the zoo?s animals, 
thanks to the Carlsbad Foundation?s Barbara Meyer Living Desert fund.

And the public is invited to see their reactions at a ?Boomer Ball Bonanza.?

Starting at noon, seven different exhibit areas will be visited every 
half-hour, with Boomer Balls, ?logs? and spools left for the animals to discover.

Holly Payne, the park?s wildlife culturist supervisor, said the park selected 
animals that would benefit the most from the items the park could order. 

The animals include javelinas, bobcats and mountain lions, and a black bear, 
porcupine, badger, gray fox, ringtail and coachwhip snake. 

?Some were chosen because we thought we?d get a good reaction, so the public 
can learn more about what we?re doing and how important this is,? Payne 
said, adding, ?We don?t guarantee that people will see a reaction.?

Payne said some animals will probably go right up to the toys, especially if 
food is placed inside. But it will likely take a little time for others to 
investigate.

?This is the first time some will have seen any item like this,? she said.

About 20 toys were purchased with $400 from the Foundation fund. They vary in 
size from just a few inches to 2 feet long. 

The toys are made of high-density plastic, so they are very durable, Payne 
said, and they can be exchanged, so new items enter an animal?s enclosure.

n recent years, psychologists and other health professionals have made us 
realize that our health depends largely on our behavior. Eating soy, it now 
appears, is one of the simplest things we can do to boost our health. 
Once revered as a sacred crop in China, soybeans are one of the richest plant 
sources of protein. In fact, the World Health Organization considers it on 
par with meat and dairy proteins. But not only is this low-fat dietary protein 
great news for vegetarians or dieters, a growing body of research indicates 
that soy may help prevent many chronic diseases. Many of its therapeutic benefits 
are believed to come from its vast stores of isoflavones. These bioactive 
plant chemicals function like weak estrogen--a female hormone necessary for 
normal growth and development--by adjusting the hormone's effects when levels are 
too high or low.
To get the most out of soy, health experts suggest eating whole foods like 
tofu, soymilk and tempeh because they contain higher levels of isoflavones than 
processed foods or supplements. Fortunately, there are now a variety of soy 
and tofu products that are both convenient and tasty. Soymilk can be found 
nationally in refrigerated sections of supermarkets, and it easily replaces cow's 
milk for both drinking and cooking.</docText>

He may be the most intensely private man ever to seek public office. What
makes Ralph run?
...
Ralph Nader on a campaign swing? This is the man who in 1996 spent less
than $5,000 on his presidential bid, and who wouldn't even allow the Green
Party to use his name for fundraising. This year, Nader vows things will
be different. "Last time I stood for president," he says. "This time I'm
running." Since he announced his candidacy, Nader has hired full-time
campaign workers, pledged to raise $5 million, and hit the road to stump
in all 50 states before the Green Party held its convention in June.

"He's demonstrated that each citizen can have an impact and change the
government," says Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat from Ohio who has known
Nader for 25 years. "He's had more of an impact on institutions of
government and corporate life than many people who have held public office."
...
Not all of the hurdles faced by Nader are external to the campaign. So
far, the Green Party has not demonstrated much ability to reach beyond its
core constituency. Nader's audiences are often overwhelmingly white and
disproportionately filled with practitioners of decidedly alternative
lifestyles. At campaign events, tables are invariably stuffed with
literature on animal liberation and vegan nutrition, issues that are
unlikely to play in Peoria.

On the March swing, an oppressive air of virtue and clean living hung over
many campaign events. At the Whole Earth Center in Princeton, for
instance, the crowd gathered among shelves laden with whole-wheat spinach
pies, organic soy-nut crunchies, and unsulphured, unsweetened pineapple
rings. At many events, not a drop of booze, not even a beer, was
available. The puritanism comes from Nader as well as the Greens. A
vegetarian, he has been acutely health conscious, especially since his
brother Shafeek died of cancer in 1986. At the office, Nader employees who
grab lunch at McDonald's have been known to eat their food on the sly,
careful not to let the boss catch them with a Big Mac. </docText>

America has an epidemic of obesity. Right now, it's all the rage to fight
the battle of the bulge with a low carbohydrate food plan that cuts pasta,
grains, bread and more. And there's no low-carb diet more popular or
controversial then the one pioneered by Dr. Robert Atkins. Now, there's a
new controversy about the doctor's health before his death. Was he done in
by his own diet? Dateline got extraordinary access to Dr. Atkins and his
family just weeks before he died.
...
Dr. Neal Bernard: ?The Atkins Web site says that his good health and his
clean coronary arteries were apparently due to his diet.  An extraordinary
claim.  And apparently one that was not at all true.?

Dr. Neal Barnard is head of the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, the vegetarian activist group which distributed the confidential
coroner's document.

Dr. Bernard: ?This is not a joke. This is serious business. This is a
major public health problem.?

And it would be a major health problem for millions of people who swear by
the Atkins regime if the doctor's alleged health problems were true and
could be linked to his diet. But Veronica Atkins says her husband was in
good health when he died and she has no problems with the Atkins regime.
She compares dr. Barnard's group to another regime.

Veronica Atkins: ?These things are lies. They're like the Taliban. They're
the vegetarian Taliban. Oh, I mean, I shouldn't insult vegetarians. But
they're like the Taliban, these people. They're nasty.?</docText>

Marc Langland took a break from his duties as the president of Northrim Bank 
recently to try on the outfit he'll wear as Lord Trapper. You can see Lord and 
Lady Trapper in today's parade, which starts at 11:30 a.m. along Fifth and 
Sixth avenues downtown. 

He's the guy who's got the cushiest job in the Fur Rondy parade and the least 
of costume quandaries for the Miners and Trappers Ball: Lord Trapper, Marc 
Langland. 
"I get to wear the big fur coat," he said with a laugh. "It makes it a little 
easier, particularly if it's going to be cold in the parade." 
Langland, a longtime Alaskan who's a founder and the top executive of 
Northrim Bank, once dressed as an animal in a Miners and Trappers entry of yore 
called "Cal Worthington and His Dog Spot." 
This year, he's on Easy Street with the wolf hat, staff and ready-made fur 
parka provided by David Green Furrier. Same with Lady Trapper, Doris Lake. 
Langland doesn't know his "lady" yet, except from her history and 
connections, though he did meet her husband, the late Orville Lake. The Lakes are 
well-known in the mushing community. They have been key players in sled dog racing in 
Alaska for decades and were charter members of the Alaska Sled Dog Racing 
Association. 
Doris and Orville Lake mushed in the Rondy races, which have been on and off 
for the past few years because of the weather but are scheduled to take place 
this year.</docText>

Chinchillas are rodents which once roamed the Andes of 
South America in large numbers. C. brevicaudata, short 
tailed chinchilla was hunted to deplation and is endangered. 
Its native range included the Peruvian Andes, Bolivia, 
Chile and Argentina. The long tailed species, C. lanigera, 
has been listed as endangered and was thought to be 
extinct. Chinchilla are endangered because of hunting 
and trapping of the animals for its pelts and recent 
upsurge in poaching for pets. Between 1895 and 1921 over 
three million chinchilla pelts including a small number of 
live animals were exported from Chile. Some authors 
report that more then 21 million chinchillas were actually 
killed between 1840 and 1916 and only a fraction of 
those caught were able to be exported. Upon rediscovery 
of wild C. lanigera in central Chile during the mid-1970's 
a series of studies on these endangered rodent 
populations have tried to understand chinchillas, their 
habitat and populations which continue to decline. Pet 
fanciers have driven up the market for wild chinchilla as
their colors and fur quality are different and unobtainable
in domestically farmed breeds. Smuggling operations out of 
Chile and Peru are said to be well-financed and efficiently
run.

IF God meant us to be vegetarian why did he make meat taste so good?? a
friend once said to me. This was during the year I abstained from eating
meat. It was a decision based on my fondness for animals, which is still
at odds with my love for pork chops, fried chicken and Ramly burgers. 

At the end of that year, my baser desires got the better of me and I went
back to my old murderous ways. Twenty years have passed and I am still a
meat-eater, but an extremely guilty one. Hardly a day goes by when I do
not think of turning vegetarian again. And whenever I read an article or
watch a documentary about animal husbandry and/or the meat industry I am
racked by guilt over my complicity in the ill-treatment and brutal murder
of animals. 

There are many who would accuse me of over-reacting, but although eating
meat is as natural to most of us as breathing, I believe there are few who
would be able to witness the slaughter of an animal and then happily make
a meal of it. 

The fact is, what we eat has little relation to the living, breathing
creatures we?ve come across in petting zoos, movies (think Babe!) and
books. Our meat often comes vacuum-packed, free of the feathers, fur and
even bones that would identify it as what it actually is ? a carcass. That
sounds extreme but it is the truth. 
...
 It was such a situation that led Peter Lovenheim to write Portrait of a
Burger as a Young Calf: The Story of One Man, Two Cows, and the Feeding of
a Nation. The author took his daughter to McDonald?s and watched,
fascinated, as she played with the free Beanie baby cow that came with her
burger. It was then that he realised how disconnected food has become from
its source. </docText>

A bark is a bark, or is it? Depending on how your dog bellows or bays, he 
could be saying he loves you or uttering curse words. That's where the 
Bow-Lingual comes in, the newest fad for curious cur owners who want to translate woofs 
into words. But how effective is it? Our two subject dogs - Garth and Chelsea 
- have never met. Yet they said a lot of the same phrases, at least according 
to the dog translator. A coincidence or a consumer crock? You be the judge.
Garth spotted the jogger who dared run by our house and told her off in a way 
only dogs can.
"Take your best shot!" he bellowed, at least according to the Bow-Lingual, 
the latest gadget for pet owners who want to discern what their dogs are saying.
"That's not what I want," he barked a minute later, expressing frustration - 
according to the hand-held translator - as he watched a neighbor from across 
the street walk to her car.
 
"I can't get my point across," he bayed, turning to my husband and me as he 
surveyed the comings and goings of our neighbors through the front door.
"Repeating yourself doesn't help," added Garth, our 13-year-old 
liver-and-white English springer spaniel.</docText>

Children growing up in contact with farm animals in rural areas are more 
likely to be protected against allergic asthma than their city cousins.

Research around the world has suggested exposure to animals may play a key 
role in protecting children against atopic, or allergic, asthma, which accounts 
for about half of New Zealand asthma sufferers. Dr Jeroen Douwes, from the 
Centre for Public Health Research, is leading a research project to uncover 
whether the same can be said for New Zealand children and what might be behind the 
findings.

?It appears that there is something in the lifestyles of farming families 
that is protecting them from getting allergic asthma. This is something positive 
for the rural community. If we can identify what factors are creating the 
protective effect then hopefully we will be able to develop tools that can help 
protect others.

?If there is an association between life on a farm and low levels of allergic 
asthma in New Zealand then we can compare the results with the European work. 
We might then be able to exclude a number of possible causes that are 
different from Europe and identify what it is that might help prevent allergic asthma.</docText>

The Humane Society of the United States and other groups are
waging a letter campaign to request the judge reject a proposed plea
bargain in an animal cruelty case about a dog found with its nose and
mouth taped shut.

Robert M. Lamano, of Elmer, pleaded guilty in January to animal cruelty
for abuse to the mixed Blue Heeler dog. The dog was named "Rusty" by
officials at the Society to Protect Animals in Carneys Point Township,
where it was taken after it was found on the border of Lower Alloways
Creek and Quinton in September. Because of the irreversible nature of its
injuries, the dog was euthanized. 
...
Martin Mersereau, manager of the domestic animal abuse department at
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said New Jersey has
"notorious and poorly worded" animal cruelty laws that have allowed other
convicted animal abusers with light sentences.

"This won't be the first case in New Jersey where a vicious and
blood-thirsty person got off with a slap on the wrist," he said.
"Hopefully, this will be one of the last."

In January, Gov. James E. McGreevey signed an animal cruelty bill into law
that made animal cruelty that resulted in the animal's death a
third-degree crime. Repeat offenders are now subject to third-degree
penalties, up to five years in jail and $15,000 in fines. 
...
Lynn Walker, of Providence, Rhode Island and a member of animal rights
group Voices for the Voiceless, has been requesting people send letters to
Forester through e-mail lists. Four of those lists go to people throughout
the U.S., while one goes to Great Britain.

Walker found out about the case through an e-mail list from someone in
Atlanta, Georgia. She said she was incensed when she learned about the
potential plea bargain. She sent a letter to Forester, asking that he
insure all sides had been heard in the case. </docText>

Any of the four proposed bills in the Mississippi House of Representatives 
would open a door to a form of deer hunting that many hunters and game managers 
say should not be allowed ? baiting. 
Based on history, any baiting bill faces an uphill battle to complete the 
rocky road to passage. 
In the 2001 legislative session, a bill to legalize baiting made it out of 
the House Game and Fish Committee ? a first ? on a 7-4 vote, but didn't fare 
well when it went to the full House. 
By a 74-44 vote, the House refused to call the bill to the floor for 
consideration. No baiting legislation has made it that far since.

They?re in pigs, ducks, sheep, cows, horses and birds.

And they?re in your cat, lazily curled on the part of the sofa where you
sometimes lay your head. And in your dog, who joyfully slobbers hello when
you come into the house.

Viruses. Parasites. Bacteria. Fungi.

Jumping from animals to people over time, animal-based germs and organisms
have helped create the diseases that have caused the most human deaths in
history.

Blame cattle, pigs, insects and birds for measles, tuberculosis, bubonic
plague, smallpox, influenza, whooping cough, cholera and malaria.

Previously undiagnosed diseases have proliferated in recent years because
of rapid global travel and the worldwide shipping of food, imported exotic
pets that carry diseases previously unknown to certain areas, growing
populations encroaching on formerly pristine areas and development of the
scientific and technological ability to identify the diseases. 
...
Add to that the centralized nature of animal processing plants and poor
conditions on some poultry farms, and you have the potential for a
disaster to spread as rapidly as possible, said Bruce Friedrich, a
spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

?We cram chickens together,? he said. ?A shed with 20,000 birds and each
bird with less space than a standard piece of paper, cooped up in their
own feces and urine in badly ventilated sheds. It?s a wonder that things
aren?t significantly worse.?

But one expert said criticisms that factories are unsanitary and depend
too much on injecting animals with drugs have been exaggerated. </docText>

Nancy Fisk's first love was horses. She grew up with them, 
taught horseback riding and studied horsemanship in England. 

     It was her love of horses that led Fisk, 57, to her true passion: 
raising Akita dogs. 

     It started in 1982 when Fisk was teaching horseback riding at the Dana 
Hall School in Wellesley. As she explains, a young man needed a place to stay 
and moved in -- along with three dogs, two horses, a few cats and parrots. 

     Two of the dogs were Akitas, and in October that year the female gave 
birth to a litter. 

     "I just fell in love with her," Fisk said of one puppy, whom she named 
Akiko. "I decided I wanted to breed her." 

     Twenty years later, Fisk owns Akiko Akitas on Maple Street, home to 25 
purebreed Akitas spanning four generations and the birth place of dozens more. 

     Some have competed in the renowned Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, 
which wrapped up its 128th event earlier this month. Others have been sold to 
owners from Europe to Hawaii, with the price tag ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. 

     But to think Fisk breeds Akitas for the money is a huge mistake. </docText>

A big part of hunting is being able to get up early and get to the woods 
while mere mortals are still sleeping. Maybe that's why the state Division of Fish 
and Wildlife is rewarding would-be hunters who fight procrastination. 
The state is giving gifts to potential hunters who sign up early for this 
year's round of hunter education field sessions and exams: The first 150 students 
to register at each of the nine testing locations will be given a cable 
trigger lock. 
These gun-safety devices were donated by Project ChildSafe, a program 
developed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation that distributes the free 
trigger locks nationally. Die-hard last-minute types, who want one of the devices 
but aren't among the first 150 to register for the hunting tests, can still get 
them from local police departments. Project ChildSafe says 190,000 locks were 
given to New Jersey police departments in November for free distribution. 
The hunting field sessions and exams are the last phase of the state's Hunter 
Home Education Study Course. They're the places where potential hunters show 
their knowledge and skill to state instructors. The program is a relatively 
new Fish and Wildlife offering designed to help fit hunting education into the 
"hectic schedules of today's fast-moving lifestyles." It uses videotapes, 
manuals and workbooks that allow prospective sportsmen to study at their own pace 
in their homes. </docText>

I felt compelled to respond to the article in the Wednesday, Feb. 4 issue of 
the paper concerning the neglected horses seized from a Newville farm. It is 
unfortunate that a horse needs to ?have one foot in the grave? before a humane 
society acts. I am not at all surprised that in this case at least one dead 
horse was found on the property. 
This recent case reminds me of a similar case in Cumberland County last year. 
Several of my friends reported an underweight horse to the West Shore Humane 
Society. After five calls, the humane officer finally visited the farm in 
question. Upon contacting the officer after her visit, she explained that the 
owner told her the horse (named Nugget) was just ?old? and ?sick.? 
I spent over an hour on the telephone with this humane officer explaining 
that an 18-year-old horse was not old. Further, I described several possible 
conditions (all treatable) that could cause Nugget to be so pitifully thin. My 
friends and I called the humane society several times requesting a vet examine 
Nugget. We even offered to pay for the exam. All to no avail. 
Eventually, a friend could not stand by any longer and purchased Nugget from 
the owner for $800. After a visit from an equine dentist (cost of $40) Nugget 
began to put on weight. He had a common problem that horses develop as they 
chew their food. Within three months of the dental care Nugget gained 
approximately 250 pounds and began looking like a normal, healthy horse. So much for 
this horse being ?old? and ?sick.? 
While I can forgive the officer?s lack of knowledge, I cannot excuse the 
carelessness with which the humane society pursued this case. Perhaps the farmer 
provided the required food, water, and shelter, but when you can count every 
rib on a horse, something is wrong.</docText>

An animal-welfare group hopes to neuter up to 200 cats in San Antonio by 
pricing surgeries at 5 cents per feline, in an effort to prevent the unwanted 
breeding of thousands of kittens. 
Tuesday's "Neuter Scooter for a Nickel" promotion of the nonprofit 
Spay-Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP) is expected to neuter more than 1,500 cats 
statewide. 
The promotion, in its ninth year, is part of a national "Spay Day USA" 
campaign by the Doris Day Animal Foundation that encourages spaying and neutering of 
cats and dogs. 
Besides adding to public health concerns such as cat bites and occasional 
rabies cases, uncontrolled breeding leads to a harsh life for homeless cats, said 
Marcy Lynch, community program manager with SNAP. 
A stray normally lives 2-3 years, compared with 15 or more years for a cat 
that is cared for. 
"It seems every neighborhood has its own colony of stray cats," Lynch said. 
"But I think there's greater awareness that this is a problem." 
Strays often contract feline AIDS or leukemia. Others become victims of 
cruelty, or are hit by cars. Strays that land in shelters are among the luckier 
ones, Lynch said. 
"Disease is a big killer of strays," she said. "Because of the (solitary) 
nature of cats, when they're sick or injured, they just go some place to die." 
Seven local clinics will accept cats Tuesday morning and release them in the 
afternoon. Surgeries are free for pet owners on public assistance. To request 
an appointment, call (210) 673-7722 and leave a message. 
Cat owners are asked to show proof of rabies vaccination. Rabies shots will 
be $7.50, or free for people on government aid. 
Dr. Jim Weedon, a local veterinarian and SNAP's director of operations, said 
neutering is perhaps the best form of feline birth control, since a tomcat can 
produce many litters.</docText>

James Woodrow has lived with two kinds of pain for more than a decade. One is 
physical ---- the torture of two debilitating nervous system disorders, 
sometimes so bad "it feels (like) razor blades or battery acid under my skin."

The other is the anguish and indignation the disabled man feels every time he 
walks into a store or restaurant with his service dog, Rocky, and hears the 
words: "You can't come in here with that dog," the 54-year-old Temecula 
resident said. 
While most businesses don't think twice about allowing a blind person to 
bring a guide dog into a store or restaurant, that is often not the case with 
service dogs that assist those with other disabilities, especially when the 
disability is not visible, experts say.

The animals help the disabled in a number of ways. Some are able to detect 
the onset of a seizure, or provide balance to those with trouble moving around. 
Others help those with psychological disorders stay calm. The Michigan-based 
International Association of Assistance Dog Partners estimates that 20,000 
disabled people in the United States use service dogs, including guide dogs for 
the blind and signal dogs for the hearing impaired.

        <docText>Escalating a sporadic, 35-year-old 
protest campaign, opponents of Canada's seal hunt are advocating a travel 
boycott, pushing their cause in the U.S. Senate, even recruiting Paris Hilton. 
Canadian officials say the tactics will fail and the hunt will continue. 
"There comes a point where you just have to say, `This is what we believe,' " 
said Steven Outhouse of Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans. "You 
can't back down every time someone says it's wrong." 
The new protest initiative began after Canada last year announced a quota of 
975,000 seals that could be killed off Labrador and Newfoundland through 2005. 
Protests are likely to intensify as the peak killing period approaches in 
early April. 
"We oppose the hunt for two main reasons -- it's not sustainable and it's 
cruel," said Naomi Rose, a scientist with the Humane Society of the United 
States. The society denounces the hunt as "the largest commercial slaughter of 
wildlife anywhere."

The evidence is usually obvious. A pile of brown feathers indicates a 
mourning dove. Red feathers means a cardinal. Yellow suggests a goldfinch. 
Whenever I find a bunch of feathers in the yard, I know a sharp-shinned or 
Coopers's hawk has come calling. And if I happen to be nearby when the kill 
occurs, the sky can rain soft, downy feathers immediately after an aerial attack. 
It's no wonder backyard birds spook so easily. 
But given the realities of beak and talon, I understand. A fleeting shadow 
crosses the yard and, in unison, all the birds freeze or flee. If I detect the 
panic, I scan the nearby trees for the hunter. Bird-eating hawks can wreak 
havoc at backyard feeding stations. 
That's what these hawks do -- they eat birds. There's nothing you can do to 
get rid of the hawks, but you can make sure your feeding area is relatively 
safe. Hang feeders within 10 feet of trees or shrubs, which provide escape cover 
for smaller birds. 
Try to appreciate the drama of predator and prey. I tell myself I'm lucky 
when a hawk visits my backyard. It's not often I get a close look at such a 
normally secretive bird. And it's rarer still to witness the matching of predator 
and prey. So I sit back and savor the drama. After all, the hawk doesn't always 
win. In fact, it usually loses. Typically, fewer than half of a hawk's 
strikes are successful. 
I feel fortunate to have observed several successful attacks. Once, a group 
of cub scouts came to my house for a bird banding demonstration. I had trapped 
a few goldfinches in advance and after banding them, I let the boys take turns 
holding and releasing the birds. All but the last flew uneventfully into the 
hedge that surrounded the yard. The last goldfinch flew straight up ... a 
fatal mistake.</docText>

Southwest Florida?s top panther experts descended on Caribbean Gardens: The 
Zoo in Naples on Saturday to bring the plight of the endangered species to the 
people. 
As part of Save the Panther Day, organizers from Friends of the Florida 
panther along with wildlife officials from the Florida Panther National Wildlife 
Refuge spent the day at the zoo educating people about the panther and its 
habitat. 
Larry Richardson, a wildlife biologist who works at the refuge, showed people 
how they track panthers with radio collars. He also explained the problems 
panthers are facing with loss of habitat, while giving them the encouraging news 
that there are still about 100 panthers left in Southern Florida. TO JOIN
? What: Friends of the Florida Panther 
? Cost: $15 for a family, $10 for an individual 
? Where: Friends of the Florida Panther Refuge, Attn. Treasurer c/o U.S. Fish 
&amp; Wildlife Service 3860 Tollgate Blvd. Suite 3000, Naples, FL 34114. 

?I was very interested just to know that the population has doubled, which is 
really encouraging,? said Anita Zatz of Fort Lauderdale. 
About a decade ago biologists said there were 30 to 50 panthers ? now they 
put the figure at about 100. 
Norma Dayton of Venice said she was encouraged to hear that the fences 
surrounding Alligator Alley are helping.

What's worse: Injecting a fatal dose of sodium pentobarbital into a healthy 
German shepherd or watching him walk in tiny circles as he comes unhinged in a 
kennel where the din of barking never lets up? 

Kathy Eller, Animal Friends humane education coordinator, takes a break from 
work to give a treat to Pokey, a 2-year-old hound mix who has been at the 
Strip District shelter since June 2003. Longer-term dogs get a visit to the 
offices.
Click photo for larger image. 
Though it doesn't often come down to that in the work of caring for abandoned 
or unwanted animals, the stark choice of quick death or troubled life is at 
the crux of an argument between the growing "no-kill" movement and traditional 
humane society policies that include euthanasia. 
No-kill proponents, who aim to save all homeless companion animals, say that 
euthanizing creatures that are not critically ill is cruel and unnecessary, 
and that successful programs around the country show their approach can work. 
Opponents say that goal is laudable, but that in practice, many no-kill 
shelters turn away the worst-case animals, which still have to be dealt with by 
someone, and that sometimes no-kill shelters end up warehousing animals in 
circumstances that are worse than death.

A 2003 Minnesota Livestock Industry Benchmark report argued that the state's 
$5.2 billion animal agriculture industry is an economic engine that is "at 
risk of moving" and called local governments a "key constraint" to growth.
But what is a local government to do if, as in the Ripley Township case, 
three-quarters of the 109 residents signed a petition opposing the project but for 
the most part didn't bother to attend a township meeting on the proposal?
Despite the opposition, the Ripley Township board unanimously approved the 
$12 million project. Board Chairman Bruce Schmoll said a lot of the critics 
either hadn't seen all the facts or made assumptions that weren't true.
"You have a non-ag sector setting policy for the ag people, livestock in 
particular," Schmoll said. "In most cases, I don't think they completely 
understand what's involved in trying to make a living in agriculture anymore."
One rumor suggested the project's manure stench would be so great that people 
would stop going to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, about 30 miles away.
"Hell, if I didn't know a lot about agriculture and listened to (opponents) I 
think I'd be scared too," said Rowekamp, whose plans call for a methane 
digester to zap up to 95 percent of the odor. He awaits county approval of the 
project.
Opponents, however, view the township board's approval as just another 
example of "factory farms" trumping citizens' rights. Residents point to Rowekamp's 
primary investor, New York businessman Ben Zaitz, as evidence of his corporate 
ties.
"If agriculture has to succeed by forcing things upon citizens who don't want 
them, I think that's a sad, sad state of affairs," said Adam Warthesen, a 
policy organizer with the Land Stewardship Project, a nonprofit organization that 
promotes sustainable agriculture and opposed Rowekamp's proposal.

New York's highest court has indicated that other states may be barking up 
the wrong tree when they make it easier for dog-bite victims to sue owners of 
pets without a rap sheet.

Last week, the Court of Appeals rejected a suit brought against a dog owner 
whose pet bit a 12-year-old boy. The court relied on 188 years of New York 
state law, even as other states put more responsibility on pet owners.

On Dec. 31, 1998, Matthew Collier was at the home of Charles and Mary Zambito 
in Auburn, visiting the Zambitos' son, Daniel.

When Collier went downstairs, the Zambitos' dog Cecil, a 
beagle-collie-rottweiler mix, barked at the boy. Mary Zambito placed the dog on a leash and 
encouraged Collier to allow the dog to sniff his hand, as the dog had known him from 
prior visits, according to court papers.

Cecil lunged at the boy and bit him on the face. Collier required medical 
attention and was left with a 1.25-inch V-shaped scar near his mouth, the court 
documents said.

But according to legal papers, the dog had never attacked or threatened 
anyone before.

Still, Andrea Collier, Matthew Collier's mother, argued that the dog's 
behavior of barking and running, as well as the Zambitos' practice of keeping Cecil 
in the kitchen, away from visitors, should have been evidence enough the dog 
was capable of attacking.

The Colliers argued the case should go to trial.

In a 4-to-2 vote, the high court disagreed, keeping with New York precedent 
that an animal has to have shown a previous tendency for violence for the 
owners to be held responsible for an attack.</docText>

Honk if you're sterile. That is, if you're a goose. 
Canada geese in parts of Oregon, including those in Bend, are participating 
in an experiment aimed at keeping the honking birds from proliferating. 
In short, many Canada goose populations in Oregon are about to get dosed with 
birth control. 
Beginning last week, officials from Wildlife Services began training Canada 
geese to eat cracked corn and a breadlike substance from black plastic tubs set 
out along rivers. Wildlife Services is a predator/pest-control agency within 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Once they've got geese comfortable with eating the bait, officials will begin 
adding nicarbazin, an antibiotic created for chickens. 
Although the antibiotic was originally intended to protect poultry from 
bacterial parasites, nicarbazin had the unintended consequence of rendering the 
birds sterile, according to Dave Williams, state director for Wildlife Services. 
Essentially, the drug prevents eggs from being fertilized, said Kathy 
Fagerstone, research program manager for the National Wildlife Research Center, the 
Fort Collins, Colo.-based lab for Wildlife Services. 
For five years Fagerstone and her researchers have tested the drug in a 
controlled environment at the lab. </docText>

Person County now has an animal cruelty investigator who will be able to 
investigate allegations of animal cruelty and abuse as well as promote and enforce 
animal health and well-being. 
On Friday, Feb. 13, Butch Setterington was sworn-in by Clerk of Court Debra 
Barker as the county?s animal cruelty investigator. County commissioners 
formerly appointed him to the unpaid, volunteer position on Feb. 2.
With the assistance of city and county law enforcement, as well as Person 
County Animal Control, the newly-appointed investigator is authorized to 
confiscate animals when necessary and offenders can be prosecuted in court.
State law authorizes the board of county commissioners to appoint animal 
cruelty investigators to serve without compensation. Animal cruelty investigators 
shall serve a one-year term and take the oath of office required of public 
officials.
The position has always been available, explained Animal Control Director 
Ronald Shaw, but up until now employees of Animal Control staffed the position.
But with Setterington assuming the volunteer station, employees? time will be 
freed-up so additional staff duties within the department can be attended, 
Shaw said.
?Obviously, we will go out there and look first,? said Shawm referring to 
the initial steps taken when Animal Control receives a call or report of abuse, 
neglect or cruelty. If the call turns out to be legitimate then the case can 
be handed over to the cruelty investigator, he said.</docText>

PROPOSAL: Group ai
Alaskans have been crashing cars and trucks into moose about five or six 
times per day since the start of the year. 
The carnage includes a tragedy near Mile 105 of the Parks Highway on Jan. 5. 
John J. High of Trapper Creek died after his Subaru Legacy smashed into a 
moose with hardly enough time to tap the brakes. A family man survived by his wife 
and two young children, High was driving home from work. 
That same day, drivers near Willow, Sutton, Palmer, Wasilla, Kenai and Seward 
also plowed into moose, according to the Alaska State Troopers. These were 
among more than 230 moose knocked down on rural highways since Jan. 1, about 100 
more than the same period last year. 
At least 16 people have been hospitalized or hurt, while hundreds have limped 
their cars home with dented fenders and shattered glass. 
In Anchorage, where deep snow has driven an estimated 1,000 moose into 
neighborhoods, parks and streets, more than 120 moose have been killed since summer. 
The specter of a huge brown animal lurking at the fringe of headlights 
continues to be the white-knuckle nightmare of every Alaska driver: 1,000 pounds of 
meat and bone threatening to bolt across your path. 
Driving highways becomes a seasonal moose roulette that annually kills one to 
three people and injures at least 100 more. Last March, a 13-year-old boy 
died when a car driven by his mother crashed into a moose dashing across the 
Glenn Highway near the weigh station. 
Even when no one gets hurt, moose collisions cost millions of dollars in 
property damage and lost time, and leaves hundreds of wild animals mangled by the 
roadside. </docText>

      Do fruit flies dream of electric bananas?
        
      It may be no bigger than a poppy seed, but some neuroscientists think the fruit fly's brain contains the rudiments of consciousness. Douglas Fox peers through this unlikely window on the human mind 
     
        
      A FRUIT fly hovers in mid-air. Its bulbous eyes capture a panoramic view of the world, but it ignores most of what it sees. Instead, it is captivated by one small thing: a bright green stripe that just zipped by. It's worth a closer look, worth landing on. The fly chases after it.

      Or so it thinks. The fly is actually in a laboratory and suspended on a wire inside a miniature flight simulator. Surrounding the fly is a cylindrical LED screen, and travelling around that screen is a vertical stripe of green light. Each time the stripe comes into view, the fly tries to steer towards it. Sensors count the fly's wing beats, measure its orientation, and control the motion of the stripe accordingly. If the fly steers hard enough, it can halt the stripe and hold it steady in its view.

      It's a neat gizmo, but watching it work I discover there's more to it than that. Inserted in the fly's brain is an electrode, and buzzing through that electrode, scrolling across a computer screen, are some curious brainwaves. Whenever the fly steers towards the stripe, these saw-tooth waves grow taller, and when the fix is lost, they shrink.

      Ralph Greenspan, the researcher showing me this experiment, thinks these little waves are a very big deal. "The fly thinks that something important is happening to it," he says. "That stripe is what the fly considers to be a significant stimulus from its environment." In other words, the fly is paying attention.

      That might not sound too impressive. Even a fruit fly needs to be able to focus on important stimuli - how else would it find food or avoid danger? But there's more to it than that. The brainwaves that Greenspan has found look uncannily like the ones you see in a human brain when it is paying attention.

For as long as Olga Duell can remember, there have been stray cats hanging 
around Ravenswood Houses.

Duell, who has lived in the Long Island City public housing complex for more 
than 35 years, estimates there are hundreds of cats calling Ravenswood's 38 
acres and 31 buildings home.

"They go into the basement to keep warm," said Duell, who occasionally fed 
strays until diabetes forced her into a wheelchair several years ago.

The cats make their way into ground-level crawl spaces that lead to the 
buildings' ventilation system. For years, according to Duell and other tenants, the 
city Housing Authority's efforts to seal vent openings have resulted in the 
deaths of countless strays caught in the crawl spaces at the wrong time.

"The cats die right under my apartment and horrible smells come up from the 
basement," said Irene Richter, a tenant of 27 years who said she began noticing 
odors every fall about a decade ago. "The air gets awful," added Richter, who 
has been feeding, caring for, and even administering antibiotics to a gray 
tabby she calls Phillip for several years. "It is like a cemetery for cats down 
there."

But Housing Authority officials say there are no strays at Ravenswood.

"Our people have gone through the buildings, inspected each one and they have 
not found any cats," said spokesman Howard Mader, who said vents are closed 
to stop rats from infesting the buildings. "We're going to do everything we can 
to keep rats off our property - if it means sealing vents to the basement, 
that's what we're going to do."

Duell said that in all her years at Ravenswood she has never seen a rodent. 
"Not even a mouse," she said. Richter argued that cat carcasses actually 
attract rodents and other pests into the basements.

When residents learned of plans to again seal the vents earlier this winter, 
they decided to take a stand, enlisting the aid of Joe Mora, an American 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals volunteer and animal rescuer who 
lives a few blocks from the complex.</docText>

Sportsmen don't
The Fund for Animals is opposing a bill (HB 1512) that would add an amendment 
to the state Constitution providing for the right to hunt and fish. The bill 
was passed by the House on Monday 189-11, and is now before the Senate.
According to Heidi Prescott, national director of the group, the amendment is 
"inappropriate and redundant" because hunting and fishing is already enjoyed 
in Pennsylvania "without that 'right' enshrined in the constitution."
What Prescott fails to realize is the amendment is needed because of what her 
organization is trying to do.
Currently, the fund is opposing numerous hunting and trapping seasons in 
various states. And Prescott doesn't think the right to hunt should be protected 
by our constitution?
Prescott was quoted in a recent Associated Press story as stating, "The 
citizens of Pennsylvania do not need to add a silly provision protecting a 
recreational hobby."
Yes we do Heidi, and it's because of people like you.
State Rep. Ed Staback, one of the bill's sponsors, said the amendment doesn't 
just protect the right to hunt and fish, but protects those activities from 
organizations like Prescott's.
Staback pointed out that animal rights groups have tried to ban bear hunting 
in New Jersey and are attempting to ban bear baiting in Maine.
"In light of that, how can she say our rights our insured or guaranteed? They 
are only insured and guaranteed when these groups don't have the ability to 
arbitrarily come into a state and decide to make the kind of changes they'd 
like to see," Staback said.
And what are those changes? "To outlaw hunting, fishing and trapping all over 
the world. That's their ultimate goal," Staback added.
Prescott's stance reeks of hypocrisy and ignorance. Who is she to tell the 
residents of Pennsylvania that we do not need this "silly" provision as she sits 
in the cozy confines of her New York City office?
I also find it interesting the Fund for Animals is now doubling as a freedom 
fighter for our constitutional rights when they are fighting to take away 
rights from others.
The group is waging active campaigns to prevent numerous stores from selling 
fur. Isn't it the right of the merchant to choose what he or she sells in 
their own store?
In my opinion, the group's opposition to the bill is placed solely on the 
fact that it will make it harder for them to chip away at our right to hunt and 
fish.
The Fund for Animals has offices in several states but not in Pennsylvania. 
As far as the interest in the welfare of our constitution, we decline your 
help Heidi. Our constitution is just fine without your half-truths and 
misconceptions.

"Some people are a whole lot worse off than I am," she said.
Working with local and state animal-rescue groups, she has resolved to find 
good, loving homes for each dog. Most of the animals are mutts - a Husky here, 
a terrier mix there. One is a German shepherd, another offers a bit of St. 
Bernard. All of Newlin's dogs are in good health, she said, and have been spayed 
or neutered. All are up to date on their shots. The dogs range from four to 11 
years old. Every one of Newlin's dogs, with the exception of the Husky mix, 
gets along with cats, and all of the dogs get along well with other dogs.
"All of her dogs are just so friendly and they're housebroken and they're 
just real lovers - they just want to be companions," said Pam Simmons with the 
Pet Rescue Foundation in Glen Allen that has been helping Newlin find homes. 
"We want to keep them out of the shelter," Simmons continued. She said once a 
dog reaches six years of age, it is not considered very adoptable. She 
believes that often people overlook the advantages of having older dogs as pets. 
"Some of their virtues are that they are calm and gentle," Simmons said. "The 
older dog knows the ropes and is easy to care for. Older dogs still play and they 
give their love just as much as the younger ones," Simmons added. 
Newlin said she wants more than anything for her dogs to find happy homes.
"I've called just about all the rescue people there are in the state," she 
said. But the competition is stiff for a good home. "There are so many millions 
of dogs that need homes; it's horrible," she said.</docText>

From widespread protein-rich diets to the ongoing mad cow scare to
McDonald's new all-white-meat chicken nuggets, meat -- and the controversy
surrounding it -- has helped shape American nutritional values.

The Atkins "very-low" carbohydrate diet plan has made its mark in fast
food restaurants such as Subway with its "Atkins Friendly" chicken bacon
wrap, in bookstores with a multitude of guidebooks and cookbooks, and in
supermarkets with Atkins brand sugar-free pancake syrup and barbecue sauce. 
...
For some, the decision to eat select meats or refrain from eating meat
altogether has religious or cultural influences.

"(The) Chinese have a traditional notion that foods that are 'warming' in
nature, like meat, are important for building up physical strength; so in
the minds of some of the older generation, one could not possibly get all
the nutrition one needed from the "cool" bean greens, white radishes, and
so forth that vegetarians favor," author Lin Ching Shywan wrote in
"Vegetarian Cooking -- Chinese Style."

Shywan wrote that she became a vegetarian because of her belief in
Buddhism, not because of a healthy lifestyle. She added that many
Buddhists advocate vegetarianism because of their belief in having mercy
for other living creatures. 
...
According to the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, a vegan
diet -- or "pure vegetarian" diet -- offers several nutritional benefits.

"Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate
for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, infancy,
childhood and adolescence," the June 2003 article said. "Vegetarian diets
offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of
saturated fat and cholesterol."

        <docText>A milestone was reached in Colorado this 
week with the first conviction under the state's felony animal cruelty 
legislation. 
Lyle Jackson Harrison of Aurora became the first person convicted in Colorado 
of felony animal cruelty for failing to provide adequate food and water to 56 
horses. As a result, he's being sentenced to 90 days in jail and 200 hours of 
community service. 
Aggravated cruelty to animals has been a felony in Colorado since 2002, but 
this was the first case that saw a conviction. Colorado's previous laws treated 
torture, maiming, or killing of animals as a misdemeanor only. 
"We applaud this conviction. It represents a victory in that laws against 
animal cruelty are not only being passed but are being enforced as the 
legislature intended them to be," says Joan Casey, American Humane's associate director 
of shelter services.
American Humane, a Denver-based organization dedicated to both child and 
animal protection, helped write this legislation and advocate for its passage. 
Spokespeople for the national nonprofit testified before the Colorado State 
Legislature on how animal abuse is linked to other types of violence, such as child 
abuse and domestic violence. The evidence is so overwhelming that 41 states 
and the District of Columbia currently have felony convictions for egregious 
acts of animal cruelty. 
The case has added significance in the wake of the recent tragic incidents in 
Colorado in which five dogs became the victims of savage cruelty after they 
were stolen from the Colorado Humane Society. Three of the dogs were set on 
fire. Only one, a puppy named Ashley, survived. Last week, American Humane 
awarded $1,000 through its Second Chance Fund to the Colorado Humane Society to 
offset the medical expenses for Ashley.
"With this conviction we have added assurance that whoever is responsible for 
these heinous crimes will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of 
the law," says Casey.
A primary goal of American Humane is to raise concern about intentional acts 
of cruelty toward animals and to encourage communities to enforce tougher 
penalties for these crimes. </docText>

The committee, which has already rejected the idea of outlawing all snares in 
its Stage 1 report, voted down Dr Scott?s bid to insert a total ban in the 
Bill.

She said: ?Snares are indiscriminate, and have a significant by ? catch, 
including species such as otters, badgers and domestic pets, and we know that 
snaring isn?t the most effective method of vermin control.?

The United Kingdom is one of just five European Union countries that still 
permits snaring.

But Mr Wilson insisted: ?Snares should remain available to land managers as a 
legitimate method of dealing with pests, but they must be used responsibly 
and professionally in accordance with the law.

?Undoubtedly the use and abuse of snares does take place, but the answer is 
not to penalise landowners and managers who already act reasonably, but to 
clamp down on those who are causing the problem, and that?s what the Bill does.?

The Bill explicitly outlaws the use or possession of any self-locking snare ? 
a wire loop ?killing trap? that tightens as the animal struggles ? while 
still permitting ?free-running? snares ? subject to regular checks at a maximum 
24-hour interval.

It prohibits the ?calculated setting? of any snare to deliberately cause 
unnecessary suffering to any animal, while banning the setting of a snare that is 
likely to cause injury to a protected species.

Several amendments for extra safeguards ? including a crimped stop to protect 
free-running snares from self-locking due to struggling animals or rust ? 
were withdrawn when Mr Wilson said ministers would consider these technical areas 
and impose new regulations if necessary.</docText>

Poaching goes far beyond illegal hunting. Markets exist for deer and 
alligator meat and hides. Off the Gulf Coast, fishermen pull in thousands of pounds of 
illegally caught grouper, mullet and other fish they sell to seafood 
processors. In Cedar Key, thieves make off with $60,000 worth of clam seeds. 
Much poaching involves protected species like migratory birds and black 
bears. In south Florida, poachers sell sea turtle eggs for $20 to $30 a dozen. A 
sushi restaurant, looking to make a bigger profit, buys sailfish, a protected 
game fish, for $2 a pound and sells it as tuna, which can cost $8 to $14 a 
pound. In Bartow, three brothers were caught with 23 gopher tortoises in the trunk 
of their car. A species of special concern in Florida, gopher tortoises are 
illegal to possess.

In addition to depleting the endangered species, ?it?s stealing,? says FWC 
spokesman Gary Morse. ?They?re abusing a resource that belongs to all the 
residents.?

Maximizing their attack
The FWC, which arrests about 40,000 people a year for all sorts of 
violations, doesn?t keep statewide records of poaching arrests and violations. (The 
agency plans to begin putting together such a database later this year.) But John 
Moran, a captain with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission now 
working at Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg, estimates that there 
are 100,000 or so poachers in Florida. Studies suggest that authorities only 
catch about 10% of all poachers.</docText>

The story goes like this: In early fall, a staff member noticed Marv hanging 
around the parking lot. Feeling sorry for him, she began to feed him. Pretty 
soon Marv managed to beg up to three cans of cat food a day. But as the weather 
grew cold, we worried about his safety. 

     So with a safe trap and a can of tuna fish in hand we set out to catch 
Marv. But what I didn't write about were the problems generated by another 
neighborhood cat. 

     From the posters that hang on every telephone pole in Marlborough's 
French Hill neighborhood, we now know that cat was Boris -- a beautiful 
long-haired silver and gray cat. 

     Back in November, Boris became a problem because instead of Marv, he 
wandered into the safe trap to eat the tuna fish. To keep him from the trap, we 
brought him into the office away from the food. Boris was friendly and clearly 
well-cared for. Believing he just got out by mistake, once Marv was caught, we 
let him go. Now we know that was a mistake. 

     But before I get too far into Boris' story, be assured that Marv is well 
and awaiting adoption at the Milford Animal Shelter. He's a little more 
social now and is slowly getting used to both cats and humans. 

     But, back to Boris. Presto Rubel, a former Winthrop Street resident who 
has since moved out of town, said she posted the notices after learning that 
Boris' owner, Bob Harter, had died. Harter, who owned the Winthrop Street home 
where Rubel and her husband lived, owned five cats, but Boris, she said, "was 
clearly his favorite." 

     Rubel describes Harter as "a well-traveled person, with a delightful 
sense of humor." And, she said, "he loved cats." 

     But unknown to Rubel, Harter died Oct. 15 of a massive heart attack and 
his beloved cats were cared for by a tenant. Rubel said she learned only two 
weeks ago of Harter's death when the tenant called to say she was moving and 
needed someone to care for the other cats. 

     It was then Rubel learned that Boris has been missing for two months. </docText>

scraggly city finds itself pressed to prove more than its ability to pave

It has to show that it hasn't gone to the dogs. 
.
They are legion, and they are leash-less. Strays saunter through public 
squares, tails wagging or teeth bared, depending on their dispositions and the 
nearness of meaty alms. Strays flank the gilded portals to fancy boutiques, like 
furry, four-legged doormen with a naked hankering for table scraps. 
.
In a widely publicized incident last summer, one stray bit a Ukrainian 
archery coach who was in Athens for Olympic test events and out for a run.

The wound was not serious, except to the scruffy image of Athens and its 
environs, whose caretakers are now trying, in a manner that might well be 
described as dogged, to tame the situation. 
.
Just a few months ago, the national government enacted legislation intended 
to reduce the population of strays by holding Greeks more accountable, with 
toughened pet-registration requirements and stiff fines for abandoning their pets 
to the streets. 
.
Athens, for its part, is funneling about $2 million this year into new animal 
shelters, new animal control officers and a major sterilization project. If 
the newly neutered strays are not adopted in two weeks, they are set free to 
roam anew, but in a less reproductive fashion. </docText>

        <docText>The U responded last week with a $299 price tag to freshman Jeremy Beckham's 
request for primate experimentation details.

Last August, Beckham, head of the Utah Primate Freedom Project, began asking 
for documents detailing the experiments currently conducted on the hundreds of 
macaques, baboons and marmosets at the U.

The U did comply with many of the requests but to obtain the more sensitive 
protocol documents, which list the exact procedures taking place, Beckham had 
to argue his case in front of the State Records Committee in January.

The committee ultimately decided Beckham had a right to the documents but 
that the U had the right to redact, or black out, proprietary information. 
However, the committee also agreed that any expenses arising from the redaction, 
such as copying or staff compensation fees, must be agreed upon by both Beckham 
and the U.

To notify Beckham of the charges, attorney Phyllis Vetter, representing the 
U, sent him a letter dated Feb. 20. 

In the letter, Vetter informed Beckham he would be charged $137.35 for "legal 
review," $126.67 for "technical review" and $35.06 for "physical redaction."

"If you wish to obtain copies of the redacted records, please send me a check 
payable to the University of Utah in the amount of $299.08," Vetter wrote.

U officials worry that releasing the documents would make private 
information-such as researchers' names and their work-available to the public. U 
spokesperson Coralie Alder said in a Jan. 15 interview that maintaining 
confidentiality "protects the U's intellectual property rights in discoveries generated by 
the research."</docText>

A farm that was investigated by the state last month was determined to be 
free of wrongdoing.
Conditions on the Route 94 farm were investigated after the state received 
calls from passersby who alleged the animals were being treated ?cruelly.? 
Rick Yocum, an agent for the state Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals, said Thursday the farm, owned by resident Glen Senise, was 
investigated last month following the complaints. 
Doreen Ross, of Mount Arlington, was one of the people who called the SPCA to 
report Senise. Ross, who often drives along Route 94 to visit her parents in 
Wantage, said she had seen cows in the field locked up in a small pen with 
water and mud up to their bellies. 
An agent from the SPCA found during a recent visit to the farm that the cows 
were moved to more stable property, Yocum said. 
?Apparently they are in a much better place and we are happy about that. We 
just hope he doesn?t put them back there.?
According to Yocum, the agent who visited the property found a slushy field 
and a lean-to shelter that wasn?t up to par.

The reports of mutilated seals being found in the Seacoast area 
beginning last summer have prompted two Rye residents to start a reward fund. 
Outraged by the acts, Kim LaFrance and her husband, Craig Mitchell, want to 
help the efforts of marine law enforcement agencies to find and prosecute the 
perpetrators of these crimes. 
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the law-enforcement bureau of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, along with other 
government agencies, are investigating the deaths of eight seals that were found 
skinned, some with their male genitalia removed. Investigators said the genitalia 
are likely being sold on the black market to Asian countries, where the items 
are considered a valuable aphrodisiac. "We are so disgusted by this," said 
LaFrance. "We know the motivation is money, so maybe the reward fund will allow 
someone who can solve this case to come forward. It is our hope to create a 
substantial reward fund so that (those) responsible for these deplorable and 
heinous crimes will be caught." 
Having been given the green light by federal agents, the "Seacoast Seal 
Reward" offers two immediate ways that people can donate to the fund. A third, a 
Web site, is under construction and will be available soon.</docText>

WE love happy endings. Dogs and cats traversing thousands of miles to reunite 
with their humans is a Hollywood theme, but most "lost dog/cat" stories do 
not end happily. Losing a dog or cat is easier than you think, but simple 
precautions increase the odds of finding your lost pet. 
Make sure your dog or cat always wears a collar with identification tags even 
if it has been microchipped or tattooed. Anyone finding your lost pet would 
have your contact information at their fingertips. 
Rabies and license tags are registered with your contact information, and you 
can purchase identification tags with your name and contact phone numbers at 
almost any pet supply store, veterinarian office or off the Internet. Just 
remember, it is important to keep your contact information current. 
Collars with identification tags are important, but they easily can become 
separated from your dog or cat. Microchipping is a relatively inexpensive and 
virtually painless way to ensure that your dog or cat will be reunited with you 
if they ever become lost. Most veterinarians and shelters offer this service, 
and your pet is then registered in a nationwide database. 
Again, keep your contact information current.</docText>

Public lands ranchers in the arid Southwest are struggling through a severe 
drought. Stock tanks are dry, grasses are sparse, and livestock and wildlife 
are struggling to survive. 
Additionally, urban sprawl pressures and off-road vehicles make worse an 
already dire situation for ranchers and the land. Many Arizona working ranches 
that have supported generations of families have had to suspend or greatly reduce 
cattle grazing. Public lands ranching is a dying business. 
James Knorr's Feb. 20 letter - "Grijalva's bailout plan is wrong" - is 
insensitive to the plight of ranchers on public lands. Ranchers, land managers, 
scientists, Congress and conservationists are working diligently to overcome 
ranching hurdles in Arizona and across the West. 
The national and Arizona voluntary grazing permit buyout bills, currently 
pending in Congress, offer a "win-win" solution for ranchers and the environment. 
A total of 180 Arizona ranchers and 190 environmental organizations are 
supporting the Arizona bill and a permanent buyout option, and the list of 
supporters is growing. Yet there are still uninformed naysayers who don't realize that 
the buyout will help ranchers, protect the environment, and save taxpayers </docText>

The Luis A. Ferre Science Park in Bayamon is a zoo, a space museum, and a 
great place to have a family picnic. If you are looking for a place where your 
kids can roam around, have some fun and even learn something along the way, this 
is the place to visit.
The science park is located on a rock hill on Road 167, off toll Highway 22.
From its perch, the museum offers a sprawling view of the city in all its 
urban chaos. But landscape appreciation of urban disarray is a thing for adults 
to enjoy, for kids there are plenty of rockets and monkeys!
Upon entering the park, most visitors work their way through the zoo and end 
their visit at the top of the hill alongside the genuine NASA rockets on 
display. But first things first, let's talk about the animals.
The Science Park has a good zoo collection that includes tigers, baboons and 
one very slow hippopotamus. The zoo grounds have winding paths that go past 
the animal cages and a small pond where geese and other type of awkward bird 
species lounge around while visitors have their lunch in gazebos around the 
water's edge. If you don't want to bring your own food, there is a food kiosk by 
the pond. Adults should not get very excited about this, the eating choices here 
are definitely geared to a younger age group. The menu includes such choice 
items as quick-bake pizza, hot dogs and pop-corn. Three standards of children's 
cuisine.
Zoos can be double edged swords since their maintenance has a huge effect on 
their young visitors. For most children, a well-kept zoo brings to reality an 
exotic animal world only previously available in the Discovery Channel.
On the other hand, an poorly maintained collection of animals in captivity 
wandering aimlessly inside their cages in lonely circles of desolation could 
hurl your young child into a vortex of pre-pubescent doom.
Although many of the animals appear to be sort of blue, they are well taken 
care of. As one caretaker explained, some animals are not sad, just indifferent.
The tigers are naturals at this indifference technique. But as any cat owner 
knows, felines spend more than 60 percent of their lives sleeping and 
wallowing in indifference, so while the tigers aren't very entertaining, their apathy 
is actually a good sign, they are normal!.</docText>

An editorial
Agriculture Secretary Rod Nilsestuen is an able administrator who has 
displayed a far greater concern for the future of farming in Wisconsin than most of 
his recent predecessors. We do not doubt the sincerity of his desire to develop 
a better system for resolving disputes over proposed factory farms. 
But the livestock-siting legislation that Nilsestuen is currently promoting 
is sincerely wrong for Wisconsin. 
The bill Nilsestuen supports, AB 868, supposedly sets basic requirements for 
approving or rejecting the expansion of cattle, dairy, pig, turkey and other 
animal farms. There is certainly a need for regulation of 500-, 1,000-, 2,000-, 
3,000- and 4,000-head industrial farms, which create dramatic environmental 
problems, encourage the spread of animal diseases and depress prices in a 
manner that is guaranteed to drive working farmers out of business. Other 
Midwestern states have enacted controls, and Wisconsin has been embarrassingly slow to 
move on this fundamental issue. 
Unfortunately, AB 868 does not effectively control against the establishment 
of factory farms. Rather, it provides a road map for corporate farming 
interests that want to litter Wisconsin's landscape. As Ruth Simpson, a board member 
of Family Farm Defenders, correctly points out, "The intent of this 
legislation is to increase the number of large-scale factory farms in Wisconsin."

        <docText>The Cat Welfare Society 
of Israel (CWSI) today called on officials of the Israeli government to stop 
the mass killing of feral cats in the Sharon Region north of Tel Aviv. The 
killings are in response to a single case of rabies found in one cat in the area. 
Thousands of feral cats, in addition to owned animals, are at risk of being 
poisoned with Alpha-Chloralose-laced food baits thrown in the streets, or are 
being trapped and then killed. 


"The poisoned cats are dying a slow and agonizing death," said Rivi Mayer, 
CWSI founder. "Dogs and other animals who could eat the poisoned bait are also 
at risk. In addition, people who bring their pets to veterinarians for rabies 
vaccinations are having their pets confiscated if the pets are not previously 
vaccinated or if their rabies booster is overdue. Some pets also have been 
confiscated from their homes." 
The Israeli Government's actions began six weeks ago after one cat was 
identified with the disease, due to an outbreak in foxes in the area. Despite six 
weeks of protests from animal welfare groups and other concerned citizens 
against the mass cat killing, the Government indicated it would continue the 
extermination of the animals for another four and a half months. 
Dr. Elliot Katz, founder of In Defense of Animals (IDA), said, "The mass 
poisoning of these innocent beings is terribly wrong. It is an expedient response 
that stems from ignorance, callousness, fear or even hate. I urge the Israeli 
government to cease this unwarranted mass killing of innocent animals, 
replacing it instead with vaccination and quarantine programs. </docText>

 on Wednesday sued animal-rights 
activists who have targeted the company, asking a judge to order a halt to actions 
that have "moved from harassment and intimidation to full-blown terrorism." 
The lawsuit claims that after months of making threatening phone calls and 
visits to employees' homes, vandalizing employees' private property, and so 
forth, Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA (SHAC USA) had a hand in last August's 
bombing of Chiron's headquarters. 
"On information and belief, Chiron alleges that the FBI has linked the person 
suspected of carrying out the bombings, a man named Daniel Andres [sic-- San 
Diego, toSHAC USA's president, Kevin Jonas," the lawsuit says. 
FBI Special Agent LaRae Quy wouldn't comment Wednesday other than to note, 
"We only have charges pending against Mr. San Diego and not against anybody 
else," although "we do feel he's had support." 
Officials in October named Daniel Andreas San Diego, 26, of Sonoma, as a 
suspect in the Chiron bombing as well as in the September bombing of Shaklee Corp. 
in Pleasanton. Nobody was hurt in either explosion. San Diego remains a 
fugitive, considered armed and dangerous, with a reward of $50,000 offered for 
information leading to his arrest. 
SHAC USA spokeswoman Alex Bailey characterized Chiron's complaint as a "SLAPP 
suit," a strategic lawsuit against public participation aimed at limiting 
SHAC's First Amendment rights. 
"If the Chiron suit looks anything like the other 12 SLAPP suits we've come 
up against, it's an entire lawsuit based on a guilt-by-association theory that 
doesn't square with the Constitution," she said. "Never once has there been 
any judgment against us, and we don't expect there to be one in this case </docText>

Working tirelessly, four St. Tammany women with a small core of 
behind-the-scene volunteers managed to provide low-cost sterilization of 821 cats and dogs 
in 2003 through the Spay-Neuter Intervention Program, otherwise known as the 
SNIP van. 
The program provides spay and neutering services to pets whose owners 
otherwise could not afford this service and meet income levels according to federal 
guidelines. 



When space is available, the van also provides the service to residents who 
are working to reduce colonies of stray cats and dogs in their community. 
Florence Ordogne of Mandeville, Lisa King of Abita Springs and Jean Northrup 
of Folsom coordinate SNIP visits in their communities as the Southern Animal 
Foundation West St. Tammany Chapter. In Slidell, Vickie Campos coordinates 
visits in Slidell, Pearl River and Lacombe. 
Although the SNIP van recently experienced a management change and is now 
being run entirely by the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals in New Orleans, the only change to north shore coordinators is finding an 
additional $100 per visit to cover the cost of the van. </docText>

        <docText>Joseph Stuebing's trip to a local feed store in early 
October 2003 mattered little to state and local officials who visited his Dutch Mill 
Road farm that day -- looking for answers to explain why 23 horses in his 
care were slowly starving and dying. 
"I saw about seven vehicles pulling in at one time, like a parade," Stuebing 
told his attorney during a pre-trial hearing in municipal court Wednesday. "I 
was just bombarded with people ... and panicked. It was overwhelming. They 
were just bombarding me with questions." 

 
Stuebing claimed he did not know he had a right to refuse the officials 
entrance to his farm. Arguing a motion to suppress evidence against Stuebing, 
defense attorney Charles Iannuzzi said that the "entourage" of officials 
overwhelmed Stuebing that day, making him feel as if he had no choice in the matter but 
to allow them on the farm. 
"(The state) fails to tell him he has a right to refuse," Iannuzzi said. "As 
a result, the fruits of that search should be suppressed." 
Municipal prosecutor John Adams argued that Dr. Karen Froberg, a senior 
veterinarian for disease control with the State Department of Agriculture, has a 
right to enter any farm with or without the owner's permission for the safety of 
the public. </docText>

Leave it to a sweet-faced Holstein to remind us of the ugly work of
bringing beef to the dinner table. When the nation's first confirmed case
of mad cow disease cropped up in December, Americans received a crash
course on the nastier aspects of the cattle business. We learned, for
instance, that cows walking up the slaughterhouse line are often stunned
with a blow to the head, which can spew bits of brain into the muscle.
That there's a process called "advanced meat recovery" in which the
meat?later ground into tasty sausages or ballpark hotdogs?is sheared so
close to the bone that it often contains spinal cord tissue. And that
newborn dairy calves often survive on a formula fortified with protein
from the blood of their brethren.

With the mad cow scare, many of these practices are on their way out. Yet
there's plenty about the way meat is raised in the United States that can
turn the stomach of even the heartiest carnivore. So, it's no surprise
some companies have decided there may be a market for meat raised in less
grisly conditions. Burgerville, a Northwestern chain, announced this week
that it would buy beef solely from "a cooperative of 40 sustainable family
ranches dedicated to raising cattle in harmony with nature, without the
use of hormones, antibiotics, genetically modified grain or any animal
by-products." All of this sounds very lovely to the consumer, but how much
difference does it make to the cow? And just how bad do the animals that
end up in the grocery store really have it?

To answer these questions, Slate presents this guide to what happens to
your meat?whether it's beef, pork, or poultry?on its way to the table.</docText>

        <docText>The subject of cats again made Akron City Council's Health 
and Social Service Committee agenda at its Feb. 23 meeting as council looks 
for ways to satisfy the continuing debate of what to do about stray cats. 
Testifying at a 1:30 p.m. committee meeting, chaired by Councilwoman Rene? 
Greene (D-4), were members of Citizens for Humane Animal Practices (CHAP); Jeff 
Fusco, Akron's deputy service director; Richard Farkas, executive director for 
the Humane Society of Greater Akron; and several other concerned citizens. 
According to Greene, the legislation under consideration "offers incentives 
to encourage responsible pet owners to spay and neuter their pets, including 
cats and dogs."


The proposed legislation would provide low-cost spay and neuter clinics as 
well as low-cost microchip implants to low-income pet owners. Provisions of 
previous legislation that allow for trapping stray cats and requiring pet owners 
to keep all their pets on their own property will not change. Those latter 
provisions have caused the most rancorous debate because most captured stray cats 
are euthanized after three days. 
CHAP has always maintained that the most effective way to control stray cats 
is through a spay and neuter and release program. It has worried members that 
personal pets could be captured and euthanized before the owner could retrieve 
them from the animal shelter. But this committee meeting remained calm, 
despite CHAP not agreeing with the proposal.

Animal activists in Orissa are furious at the wildlife department's move to 
plant four-inch-long iron spikes on a route frequented by elephants in a bid to 
keep them away. 

The spikes were placed under a bridge located on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar 
to prevent elephants from travelling here from a nearby sanctuary, where 
around 20 elephants reside. 

In the winter, tuskers from the adjacent Chandaka sanctuary join them, 
swelling their numbers to around 40. 

These elephants used to regularly cross from under the bridge and travel to 
farmlands and human habitations here, creating chaos and damaging crops.

The forest department initially dug trenches to prevent the elephants but 
these proved ineffective. Then they put up stonewalls. 

To avoid the barricades, the elephants took to travelling from under the 
bridge, located over a stream.

Locals said the taller elephants would bend on their knees to cross over. 

In a bid to again outwit the elephants, the forest department constructed an 
iron and concrete platform under the bridge and placed the spikes on it.

Urban Texans own a lot of rural Texas. And they are buying more. 
When a piece of rural land is sold in Texas these days, the buyer is almost a 
cinch to be an urban or suburban resident purchasing the tract for what can 
be generalized as "recreational" purposes. 
The buyer doesn't plan to put the land into agriculture or livestock 
production, as it probably previously had been used. Instead, the land will be used as 
a retreat, a place to hunt or fish or a "country place" to which the owner 
can temporarily escape or move to at retirement. 
This new group of rural landowners often has little or no experience with 
managing land and lacks the knowledge necessary to make the property as 
productive for wild things as they almost all want them to be. 
Many, if not most, of these landowners would jump at the chance to learn how 
to best handle their land and take full advantage of opportunities to improve 
them. 
This change in rural land ownership has not escaped state and federal natural 
resource agencies or private conservation organizations. They know the future 
of wildlife and healthy natural landscapes depend on these new owners of 
rural land being given the tools to best care for their new responsibility. 
"Giving people the information they need -- the basics of how to manage their 
land for wildlife -- is something we realize there's a big need for," said 
Diana Foss, a Houston-based urban wildlife biologist for the Texas Parks and 
Wildlife Department. </docText>

Veterinarians yesterday cast doubt over a recent speculation that a growing 
number of dogs died of renal failure because they all ate the same dog food 
made by a well-known international company. 
Rumor is rife on the Internet that this particular brand of dog food contains 
too much salt and therefore causes terminal kidney diseases among dogs. Local 
media reported on the matter following a meeting at the Taoyuan County 
Veterinarians Association earlier this week. 
Chang Tsung-ming, secretary-general of the association, said members of his 
association have recently reported a rising number of renal failure cases but 
stressed that more research is needed before drawing any conclusion. 
These dogs typically developed symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and 
difficulties in urination, according to Chang. 
He has requested the 83 affiliated veterinarian hospitals to gather relevant 
diagnoses and data before the next member meeting, which has been moved ahead 
to early March. 
Josephine Chen, a spokeswoman for the dog food maker, refuted the allegation 
by saying that SGS testing showed a sodium chloride level of 0.34 percent in 
the dog food, which is far lower than the international standard of three 
percent. 
"Our products are marketed in over 120 countries around the globe and we have 
never discovered similar incidents," she said, adding that the isolated cases 
in Taiwan should be subject to further testing. </docText>

Don't let your cat get fat. 
It's the most common nutritional disorder in humans and pets -- obesity. 
For some unkown reason, cats are being hit extremely hard. 
"An average weight cat should be around ten pounds, and we're seeing cats 
that are 18, 21 pounds. I've seen one that was 28 pounds. There's actually one on 
record at 54 pounds," said Dr. Craig Prior. 
Lucky is a fat cat. He used to weigh 19 pounds. Chunky is cute -- until you 
consider what it's doing to your cat. 
"You're predisposing your cat to diabetes. You're predisposing your cat to 
liver problems, you're predisposing your cat to joint problems. It's just not 
healthy," said Dr. Prior. 
In fact, the number of feline diabetes cases has skyrocketed, and for some 
reason, overweight, older male tabbys are most at risk.
Just a few weeks ago, Lucky's owner noticed he was drinking a lot of water. 
That, along with urinating, eating more and sudden weight loss are all signs of 
diabetes.
"We've limited how much food that he's getting, he's down to just one can a 
day. So he gets a half a can twice a day, which he doesn't like at all. And 
then we've also had to start giving him insulin shots," said Lucky's owner.
It's not just how much food they eat, it's the kind of food. Cats are 
predators, so they need meat. High in protein, with low carbohydrates. And the best 
place to find that is in canned food with no gravy.</docText>

Q. My dog was recently diagnosed with pancreatitis. What exactly is this 
disease?
A. Pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas. Severity can range from 
mild to quite severe. The problem occurs less often in cats, most likely due 
to their finicky eating habits. One of the roles of the pancreas is to produce 
enzymes, which aid in the digestion of food in the upper gastrointestinal 
tract. The pancreas becomes inflamed for several reasons, including viral and 
bacterial infections.
The most common cause in dogs is eating foods that are not part of their 
regular diets. Typically, these are table scraps and garbage. Fatty foods are the 
worst. The disease is often seen around the holidays or family gatherings in 
which pets are fed leftovers. Current nutritional recommendations are to feed 
pets diets specifically formulated for them. Their gastrointestinal tracts 
become accustomed to a constant diet and any deviations can lead to pancreatitis. 
Changing dog food should be done gradually over a few days.</docText>

A form of avian influenza has been floating around at the Little Rhody Egg 
Farm in Foster, Rhode Island for over a year killing 2,000 birds last spring. On 
February 23rd, 30 Department of Environmental Management and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture officials arrived at the farm to begin killing the entire flock 
of 30,000 chickens to prevent the spread of the disease. 
Since when has this nation become so desensitized that the slaughter of 
30,000 animals (seven times the population of Foster, RI), hardly causes us to bat 
an eye. A 1983?1984 H5N2 virus epidemic (a more potent and lethal strain of 
the avian influenza) in the US resulted in the destruction of more than 17 
million birds (at a cost of nearly $65 million). To me it seems like such a waste. 
It's disgusting that "industry" has become this powerful and that profits far 
outweigh the concerns of keeping animals healthy, thus keeping the public 
healthy. But I suppose the large amounts of antibiotics (more than 70% of all the 
antibiotics used in the US are for farm animals) that are fed or injected 
into factory farm animals as part of their daily routine of eating while 
constantly caged (compensation for over-crowded and unsanitary conditions conducive to 
infections) are the "preventative measures" that we keep hearing about 
whenever an infectious outbreak occurs. </docText>

Lucy Spelman, director of the 114-year old National Zoo in 
Washington, D.C., announced plans to retire Wednesday, the same day a highly critical, 
yearlong independent review by the National Academy of Sciences was released. 
That report found severe deficiencies at the zoo in animal care, pest 
control, record keeping and management that contributed to the deaths of 23 animals 
in the past six years. "I have pushed, pulled and prodded to move the zoo 
forward," Spelman, 41, said in a news conference announcing her resignation. ?But 
now, to accelerate the rate of our progress, I have concluded that it is time 
for me to move on ... I have become a lightning rod for too much attention. It 
has become a distraction for the zoo and the Smithsonian." 
The report is a grim catalog of failure: In January, two endangered adult 
male pandas died after rat-poison pellets that emit toxic fumes were buried in 
their yard for the first time. Two of the zoo?s four Grevy's zebras died in 
early 2000 of hypothermia, and necropsies showed the animals had "no body fat" to 
ward off the severe winter weather. In 2002, after being anesthetized for a 
physical exam to check on a limp, a middle-aged lion was found dead in his cage 
the next morning from complications relating to the anesthesia. Rats are 
depressingly common at the zoo, infesting the habitats of other animals; zookeepers 
were found to misplace and even alter records on animal care.</docText>

As both Vietnam and Thailand struggle to contain bird flu outbreaks and the 
death toll mounts, confusion and fear reign at the farms. Vietnamese police 
officers are not helping matters by trying to profit from the disaster, nor are 
officials by being economical with the truth.

Trucks in the compound of Charoen Pokphand's animal feed factory in a small 
town just north of Hanoi still depart on schedule, but it hasn't been business 
as usual this past week.

Uncertainty has been slowly creeping in ever since the Vietnamese government 
issued a new regulation prohibiting the transport of animal feed unless it has 
been tested and certified as disease-free. The aim is to curb the spread of 
the H5N1 strand of bird flu that has reportedly claimed the lives of at least 
14 people in Vietnam and 8 in Thailand, and caused the death of millions of 
birds across Asia. After all, it was in this area that the H5N1 virus was first 
discovered.

For the drivers leaving the compound it means taking a chance with the local 
police, who are remarkably eager to enforce the new regulations.</docText>

Jesus Banderas gets the dog?s attention while Lutz then attacks on owner Tina 
Armer?s command.
He calls it a hobby.

But the time, energy and love that Hollister resident Jesus Banderas puts 
into training his German Shepherd in the sport of Schutzhund resembles something 
more along the lines of a passion.

Schutzhund stems from a German word meaning ?protection dog.? 

It began in the early 1900s in Germany as a way to train dogs in tracking, 
obedience and protection - specifically to maintain the working ability of the 
dogs.

It has been a popular sport in Europe for years, and has recently been 
catching on in the states, with Schutzhund clubs and competitions all over the 
country. Banderas is a devout member of the Monterey Bay Schutzhund Club.

For Banderas, it was his love of German Shepherds that lured him into the 
sport about eight years ago, and has held him in its clutches ever since.

?I guess you?ve got to like dogs, and I always have - as long as I can 
remember,? he said. 

In 1994 Banderas moved to Hollister and commuted to his job in Watsonville, 
where he would pass by a house where he always saw German Shepherds outside.

After about a year of continually telling himself one day he would stop and 
inquire about a puppy, he finally did.</docText>

        <docText>Kim Shelton arrived at work at the Hoke County Animal Shelter 
earlier this month to find one of the dogs with its head stuck under a gap between 
the animal's chain-link cage and the concrete floor.
The dog wasn't hurt, but the incident is one of many that Shelton has had to 
contend with at the aging shelter.
The Hoke County Board of Commissioners toured the shelter during a special 
meeting Feb. 16 after learning about its needs from county Animal Control 
Officer Jimmy Carthens during a retreat Feb. 4.
Commissioners found leaking pipes, peeling paint, rusting cages, cracked 
Plexiglas windows and a roof that is not adequately insulated.
"Finally, we're getting some attention," Shelton said.
Shelton is the former president of the county humane society. She said she 
convinced the county 10 years ago to contract with the organization to operate 
the shelter after she witnessed abuses and poor conditions there.
The shelter is next to the county landfill on C.C. Steele Road. It was built 
around 1980 and includes 20 chain-link cages for dogs and two open rooms for 
cats. Shelton, with the help of a part-time employee and volunteers, has added 
dog runs behind the facility. The humane society purchased a washer, dryer and 
refrigerator for the shelter.
The shelter has also been affected by the county's growing residential 
population. More people means more animals, Shelton said.
More than 1,600 dogs and cats were brought to the shelter last year, Shelton 
said. Of those, about 400 animals were adopted and about 100 were returned to 
owners, she said. The rest were euthanized.</docText>

There are as many ways to count the number of sport hunters in America as 
there are people doing the counting, and they are producing some widely different 
results. 
Regardless of the method used to count them, one trend shows up time after 
time - sport hunters in America are a vanishing breed. 
The National Opinion Reseach Center, for example, has reported a decline of 
hunting of nearly 12 percent from 1990 to 2000. Many informed observers would 
agree with T.A. Heberlein, an authority on the demographics of sport hunting, 
that, "If these trends continue, hunting as we know it will not exist by 2050." 
The reasons are obvious - loss of habitat for wildlife because of both 
urbanization and increasingly destructive land management practices, the changing 
demographics of our population, changing lifestyles in our society, and a 
growing propaganda campaign about killing animals for pleasure. 
If the reasons for the decline of sport hunting are so obvious, the most 
practical approach to reversing it is just as obvious. It is an attitude of faith 
among hunters, and widely supported by research, that people who do not begin 
hunting by the time they are in their late teens, will never hunt.</docText>

        <docText>Producers who think the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent 
announcement of stricter regulations on cattle processing and products 
containing animal material won't affect their operations much, should think again.

The fallout could hit producers in ways they haven't thought of yet.

In light of the single-case discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in 
a Washington state dairy cow -- one of Canadian origin -- the USDA has ramped 
up its regulations regarding cattle processing. Those include how cattle are 
killed and butchered and what carcass parts can be used in what manner. 
Increased limitations are now hovering snugly over material headed for both human and 
animal consumption and human health and beauty products. 
The Jan. 26 release of the interim rules left no doubt that renderers' 
markets would tighten, with the backlash of the BSE discovery felt almost 
immediately since that news went public Dec. 23, said Neil Katchen of Darling 
International, a renderer with operations in Twin Falls and Boise.

"It's a very difficult time in our industry right now. Some places, it's 
impossible to sell," the company's executive vice president of operations said in 
today's edition of Ag Weekly.

In addition to market chaos on how meat , bone meal and tallow will fit into 
the stricter regulations, more than 40 countries banned all U.S. beef products 
following the BSE discovery.

        <docText>It was a Friday morning in early October when Debi Smith 
received the e-mail: A Dalmatian had been abandoned and was running loose on a 
country road in Bland County. 
    Smith, the founder of Dalmatian Rescue of Southwest Virginia, hurried 
over from her Elliston home the next day and was appalled by what she saw. The 
dog was emaciated, she said, and a film of dirt covered his once-white coat. His 
teeth were stained yellow and showed signs of damage, probably because the he 
had been feeding on mud and rocks. 
    The dog lingered at the edge of a road between two farms, as if waiting 
to be picked up where he had been left. 
    "We figured he was tied to a chain his whole life and someone got tired 
of feeding him and just dropped him off," Smith said. 
    Smith named the dog Doc and estimated that he was 5 or 6 years old. He 
weighed a mere 45 pounds when she rescued him, but she nursed him back to health 
until he weighed a robust 60 pounds. 
    Doc became house-trained and learned to interact with humans. "He went 
from a frightened outdoors dog to a couch potato," Smith said. </docText>

The introduced feline species is a despised outlaw in a unique native 
landscape. 
Local legend has it the creatures grow to panther-like proportions and stalk 
the Tasmanian bush like crazed killing machines. 
The predatory aliens kill birds and other wildlife -- and are so good at it 
they leave nothing for the native carnivores. 
The feral cat is known as a vermin and pest. 
Animals Australia spokesperson Glenys Oogjes says the hatred, however, is 
causing pain and suffering. 
Ms Oogjes says once an animal gets branded a pest or vermin it gives some 
people the green light to hate the animal and treat it with disdain. 
"Animals Australia wants to change the prevalent perception that introduced 
wild animals have to be killed and it doesn't matter how," she said. 
"Introduced wild animals do not suffer any less than any other animal but 
they are subjected to some of the most extreme forms of cruelty imaginable. 
"They can lawfully be poisoned, starved, burned, gassed, shot from

        <docText> bronze sculpture of Marjan, the Kabul Zoo's ailing lion who 
became a symbol of war-ravaged Afghanistan, will be on display later this year at 
the N.C. Zoo for a few months before it is shipped overseas.
A Texas sculptor is preparing the bronze of Marjan who received worldwide 
attention more than two years ago through the Kabul Zoo and Afghanistan animal 
fund-raising effort coordinated by the N.C. Zoo and the N.C. Zoological Society.
N.C. Zoo Director Dr. David Jones, who has been actively involved with 
efforts to help the Kabul Zoo, updated members of the N.C. Zoo Council Feb. 25 about 
the global outreach project.
"Marjan the lion stimulated interest in the wildlife in Afghanistan," Jones 
said.
Bob Coffee, an Austin, Texas, sculptor, submitted a proposal nearly two years 
ago to create a memorial sculpture of Marjan and Kabul officials agreed to 
the donation.
"This old, busted-up lion, with one eye, his jaw hanging down - he was the 
symbol of this country. Old, ailing, but proud, like Afghanistan," said John 
Walsh after Marjan died in January 2002.
Walsh has been international projects director of the World Society for the 
Protection of Animals, a partner in the international effort to help the zoo.
In a 2002 visit to the local zoo, Walsh expressed the hope that a sculpture 
of the lion would be installed at the Kabul Zoo with only three words to 
describe Marjan, who was 24 years old, and the country's people - Old. Ailing. 
Proud."
Hundreds made donations to the fund after learning about the plight of Marjan 
who was found to be blind in both eyes and had been at the zoo during 23 
years of war and cruelty in Afghanistan. He had lost one eye to a grenade in the 
1990s and lost weight during the war years. The apparent cause of death was 
kidney and liver damage.
More than $600,000 has been raised, through the N.C. Zoo and its nonprofit 
support organization, the N.C. Zoological Society, to aid both the beleaguered 
Baghdad and Kabul zoos and animals in Iraq and Afghanistan.</docText>

With La Fiesta de los Vaqueros in town, opposing views on the treatment of 
rodeo animals are back on the front burner. 
The Animal Defense League of Arizona (ADLAZ) and two other animal-activist 
groups are planning to hold a protest Sunday outside of the Tucson Rodeo 
Grounds. 
Group leaders believe rodeo invokes naturally docile farm animals into 
violent behavior through acts of animal cruelty. 
Those working for and on the Tucson Rodeo Committee said rodeo livestock is 
too valuable to be treated poorly. 
Gary Williams, who has been general manager of La Fiesta since 1995, said 
that animal activist groups do not base their opinions on fact. 
"Animals are these people's livelihood," Williams said of those involved in 
rodeo. "These animals aren't pets. They can withstand things other animals 
cannot." 
"We are going out to protest the inherit animal abuse at the rodeo," said 
Gary Vella chairman of the ADLAZ. "People pay attention when you hurt kittens or 
puppies, but when it comes to farm animals they turn their head." 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has long been against 
rodeo. 
PETA, the largest animal-rights organization in the world, contends rodeo 
animals are treated cruelly and sent to slaughter once the event ends. 
One intolerable action is using flank straps, which go around an animal's 
abdomen and groin, a PETA official said. 
"The straps can cause them to suffer internal bleeding," Amy Rhodes, senior 
animals in entertainment representative, said from the PETA national 
headquarters in Norfolk, Va. "They also cause sores or other injuries." 
The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association states in its animal welfare 
pamphlet that the flank strap does not induce animals to buck, but instead 
"augments the bucking action, encouraging a bucking bronc or bull to kick high with 
its back feet." </docText>

Time is running out for thousands of horses used to make one of the most 
widely prescribed drugs in the country. We're talking about the Premarin horses. 
Our investigation into the treatment... and slaughter of these horses back in 
November made national news. Now in a follow-up, Terri Parker meets with the 
people inspired to help, after seeing her story... and why their help is needed 
now more than ever. 
Chris Jung introduces us to Halo. "He's a 10 month-old Premarin foal. He's 
purebred quarterhorse and we rescued him from Foal Advocates Network up in 
Canada. 
Halo has the eyes of an angel, and the spirit of... well, he's certainly got 
the usual mischief of any youngster. He seems happy to be alive here at Gaston 
Farm in Port St. Lucie...as well he should be. 
"My daughter saved him", Jung adds. "She said an angel saved him. He was sent 
by an angel." 
Jung rescued Halo from a farm in Canada, where Halo was one of thousands of 
foals slated for the slaughterhouse. Halo's mother, was one of the "premarin 
mares". As we first revealed in undercover video in November, the constantly 
pregnant mares are kept tethered five months a year in small, cold stalls in 
Canada, so their estrogen rich urine can be collected to make the menopause drug 
Premarin. 
Premarin is short for "pregnant mares urine." 
Chris Jung, who founded the rescue group "Hope for Horses" did not know what 
those premarin barns were really like, until she saw our investigation. The 
foals born each year as a byproduct, aren't needed. So when they're just a few 
months old, they along with mares too old to breed anymore...are sent by the 
thousands to feed lots to fatten up and then taken to the slaughterhouse to be 
made into dog food, or shipped overseas as a delicacy. 
Since our report, others across the country have stepped forward to save the 
Premarin foals and the pregnant mares. Alice Crow saw our investigation on our 
sister station in Cincinnati. She was so moved, she rescued thirty premarin 
mares. 
"They work for us", Crow says, "And they make so much money. Then they're 
just tossed as a byproduct." 
The fates of others hang in the balance. Sales of Premarin dropped 
dramatically last year after a 2002 study showed hormone replacement therapy could be 
dangerous, causing heart problems and strokes. Premarin's maker, Wyeth Ayerst, 
had to decrease production by one third.</docText>

Dust off the dictionary of your choice and browse through its thin pages 
until you come across the single most important word to all outdoors enthusiasts 
-- conservation. 
Different dictionaries, of course, will give it a different interpretation. 
"The act of conserving," says one. 
"The process of protection and restoration," claims another. 
For me, conservation is defined every day by a local club, the L.A. Dixon 
Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation. 
It is named after a man who was a forefather in bringing the importance of 
the wild turkey to the attention of legislatures and wildlife officials. 
Based out of Edgefield, S.C., the NWTF is supported by local and state 
chapters in providing the resources to protect, conserve and promote game habitat, 
especially the wild turkey. 
The L.A. Dixon Chapter represents hunters in Orange County and surrounding 
areas. It boasts an aggressive membership and actively participates in the 
community. 
On this Thursday night, the chapter will host its sixth Super Fund Membership 
Banquet at the Big Barn in Hillsborough. </docText>

        <docText>"Watch it," Nico Niessen warns a reporter and a photographer 
from The Star Press. "It's slippery."
Visitors to his dairy barn are normally taken into the milk parlor, office 
and feed alleys, where the floors are dry and clean.
But this particular tour also goes into the pens, lanes and ramps where the 
cows travel when they're not being milked or resting in their sandy stalls. 
Manure from 1,200 cows covers the concrete floors in those areas.
Fortunately, Niessen hands out plastic, throw-away boots to his unprepared 
guests. That protects their shoes and protects his cows from anything harmful 
the shoes might transport into the barn.
Cable-operated automatic floor scrapers slowly push squishy cow dung into 
drain trenches that flow into a 5-million-gallon storage lagoon outdoors.
"This is the swimming pool," Niessen jokes.
His cows discharge enough manure in a year to fill 750 above-ground swimming 
pools, each 52 inches deep and 24 feet around.
Niessen is one of dozens of European dairy farmers - mostly Dutch - who have 
moved to Indiana, Michigan and Ohio since the late 1990s, in part because 
there is an excess of manure in The Netherlands.
Together, the immigrants have started 11 concentrated animal feeding 
operations (CAFOs) in Indiana housing 12,625 dairy cows.
That represents more than eight percent of Indiana's dairy cow population.
Vreba-Hoff Dairy Development, Wauseon, Ohio, is steering the European farmers 
to the three states.
The company has developed three dozen dairy CAFOs for the newcomers and has 
at least 10 more in various stages of development. One of them is Dutch farmer 
Tony Goltstein's proposed Union-Go Dairy in Randolph County.
How many more will come?
"I think we're in the middle of it at this point," said Vreba-Hoff's Cecilia 
Conway, a U.S. citizen whose parents came to America from The Netherlands in 
1960. "There's still a lot of interest."
The public is making a stink over the new Dutch dairies in all three states 
because of their size, odors, manure spills, construction violations and other 
concerns.
After neighbors complained that Niessen's dairy stunk up their laundry when 
hung out to dry, the Henry County Planning Commission denied his petition to 
expand his herd from 1,200 to 1,900. Niessen hired a lawyer who sued the 
planning commission and the neighbors. The case is pending.
An organization called Environmentally Concerned Citizens of Randolph County 
formed last year to stop what it calls Goltstein's proposed "factory farm," 
which would house 1,650 cows. The future of that dairy remains up in the air.
The average dairy farm in Indiana has about 75 cows. The dairies being 
developed in Indiana by Vreba-Hoff range from 675 cows to Niessen's proposed 1,900 
cows.</docText>

 Long before Steve Hindi became known as an animal protector, he was known
as an animal killer.

He had the ultimate fish tale: He caught a 71/2-foot-long, 230-pound Mako
shark.

His story spread quickly, courtesy of a write-up in the New York Daily News.

He caught it in a boat smaller than the fish itself, wrestling his way to
fame off the coast of Long Island during five trying hours in 1985.

But the attention he received from that one fight would be nothing in
comparison to the hundreds of press accounts that would focus on Hindi in
the years to come.

Those closely involved in the polarizing animal rights debate disagree on
everything about Hindi - from whether his tactics are effective to whether
his statistics are accurate.

But no matter what they think of Hindi, they can't help but think of him
because he keeps popping up.
...
While many animal rights groups rely on traditionally influential
techniques - most notably finding strength in numbers - Hindi's fight has
mirrored his "Old Man in the Sea" tale.

A lone man in a small boat, he fights desperately against a force far
stronger than himself. His usual method of attack takes him around the
country to covertly shoot video of animal abuses and then broadcast those
videos on a specially equipped truck that now has 100-inch screens.

That struggle has taken its toll, most noticeably by breaking up his marriage.
...
But Hindi insists that using violence is just as bad as abusing animals, a
much different view than some animal rights groups, like the Animal
Liberation Front.

"The biggest lie told by a component of our side is that we have the right
to use violence because they use violence," Hindi said.</docText>

When lawmakers called for better beef labeling last month after mad-cow
disease was found in the U.S., the American Meat Institute complained they
were piling costs on a financially beleaguered beef industry.

A few weeks later, a plan for meat packers to help cover inspection costs
drew another woe-filled response from J. Patrick Boyle, president of the
trade group, who said "farmers, producers and processors are reeling from
the economic impact" of mad-cow disease.

But two months after bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was found in a
cow in Yakima County, it appears the beef industry isn't really "reeling." 
...
To be sure, mad-cow disease is costing money. Dairy farmers and cattle
growers saw the value of animals older than 30 months plunge and stay down
because those are most at risk for the disease.

Beef processors ? as slaughterhouses and meat packers are known ? have
laid off about 1,000 workers to reduce costs and slow production in
response to lost exports. Certain beef cuts and "specialty meats" such as
eyeballs, tongues and intestines no longer bring premium prices in Asia.
Instead, they're ground into hamburger or sent for rendering. Some
processors are still grappling with meat stranded on ships and in foreign
ports when BSE was discovered. 
...
Mad cow couldn't have struck at a better time, as far as the industry's
ability to handle the blow. Producers and processors, which churned out 26
billion pounds of product last year, had raked in record profits, unusual
for a sector given to relatively staid business cycles.</docText>

The Frankenmuth livestock veterinarian is participating in the newly formed 
Michigan Emergency Veterinary Network -- a group whose aim is to reduce the 
threat of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases in animals. 
"They've been talking about this since 9/11. It's not associated with the mad 
cow outbreak," Luhring said. "It's part of the large picture of being more 
alert and aware of an exotic disease. It's an educational process." 
Eventually, network leaders want to enlist all 3,600 animal doctors statewide 
in the effort, also called Vet Net. 
But other Saginaw County veterinarians who handle mostly cats and dogs wonder 
whether a bioterrorist threat is relevant to their practice. 
"What are (terrorists) going to do? Strap a bomb on a Saint Bernard and set 
him on the road?" asked Dr. Elizabeth S. Walton, owner of Freeland Animal 
Clinic. 
Vet Net will make information about bioterrorism, emerging infectious 
diseases and foreign animal diseases available to veterinarians four times a year. A 
second phase this spring will create a corps of 50 to 100 veterinarians with 
more specialized training. 
The third phase will include training about foreign animal diseases, emerging 
infectious diseases, bioterrorism agents and emergency response. 
"What are the bioterrorism threats directed against animals?" said Dr. Dan 
Grooms, a veterinarian and professor at Michigan State University. "What are the 
foreign animal diseases that, frankly, we are not familiar with? What are the 
emerging infectious diseases?" 
Bioterrorists could cause famine and widespread economic disruption by 
targeting farm animals. They also could spread zoonotic diseases -- those 
transmitted from animals to people, such as West Nile virus. </docText>

SEOUL - "Have you ever seen the origins of life?" asks Hwang Woo Suk,
leader of a South Korean team of scientists credited with creating the
world's first cloned human embryos. He slaps on a pair of surgical gloves
with a whack. "They don't always smell very good," he chuckles.

Hwang should know. After voluntarily suspending the South Korean human
embryo project as he waits for international and domestic consensus on the
ethics of his work, Hwang still has his hands full, going back to his
roots -- in a pig sty.

He whirls around to where assistants have a 6-foot-long sow, an anesthesia
mask strapped over her snout, splayed out rather indelicately on her back,
feet in the air, resting on a steel gurney in a pig pen steaming with
methane. Ignoring the indignant grunts resonating from the lineup of other
surrogate mothers still on all fours, he cuts open the belly of the pig,
punching his gloved hand deep inside her until he pulls out her uterus. 
...
His shoe-string cloning project operates on a fraction of the budget
typical in Western labs. "Their organs will be more suitable for human
transplants."

"Cloning," he says, tucking the uterus back in, "should be used to improve
the human condition."

"Ok, so I cloned a human embryo," he says, moving away from the pig. "Do
you blame me? Who can blame me? I am not out to clone a human. I am trying
to save human lives. If I were out for more," he said, gesturing with a
bloody glove around the pungent sty, "do you think I'd be working in a
place like this?" </docText>

Ranchi, Wild elephants in Jharkhand will now have their favourite intoxicant 
placed at their doorstep -- to keep them from plundering human habitations in 
search of the brew! Forest officials in Jharkhand have drawn up a novel plan 
to keep wild elephants at bay with 'mahua', a local brew that the animals are 
known to be partial to. 
The elephants are known for their love of 'mahua', prepared from the flowers 
of a local tree of the same name, and often barge into villages in search of 
the liquor. 
Damage to property is usually extensive during these forays, which often 
result in the loss of lives. 
Last month elephants raided two villages in Dumka and Godda districts to 
drink mahua. They trampled four mahua traders to death and consumed their liquor 
stocks before returning to the forests. 
Taking advantage of the animals' weakness for the brew, the Jharkhand forest 
department has decided to place stocks of mahua near water bodies frequented 
by elephants. 
This, the foresters hope, will help contain the elephants within forests. 
"We have identified 50 water bodies where elephants generally drink water. 
Mahua will be kept near these water bodies to ensure that they do not venture 
into villages in search of the drink," a forest official told IANS. 
According to officials, elephants also enter villages to raid granaries.

        <docText>Dan Koons learned the bad news Dec. 
23 just like everyone else, but his reaction was more intense than most. 
Koons, who raises beef cattle at Funk Farms Trust near Shirley, was watching 
TV news when he heard that a 6-year-old Holstein dairy cow in Washington state 
had tested positive for mad cow disease. 
"I felt sick," said Koons, who has raised cattle his entire life. "We'd just 
come through two or three tough years. Demand was up. Supplies were shrinking. 
"I had sold cattle for $1.06 per pound in November. It helped pay off the 
damage of the last two or three years. It just knocks you off your feet." 
Mad cow disease was never considered a possible terrorist threat because the 
disease is not contagious among cattle. However, its occurrence reinforced a 
strengthening message of security for the nation's agricultural industry that 
feeds the United States and the world. 
And it showed how a threat to the food system can cause havoc. 
The mad cow confirmation caused live cattle futures prices to plummet from 
92.35 cents per pound Dec. 23 to 73.52 cents per pound seven days later. Prices 
now hover in the 75 cents per pound range.

THE state head of the RSPCA has launched a stinging attack on those people 
who claim the organisation is operating a kill and chill policy at the Port 
Macquarie branch, calling them "a cancer in animal welfare".
Bernie Murphy, chief executive officer of the RSPCA's NSW network responded 
to claims aired in Friday's Port News that the branch was failing to save 
animals from death row and operating a 'slaughterhouse', calling them mischievous 
and unwarranted.
A former branch member said she believed too many animals were being 
euthanased because the RSPCA was not taking on as many from the pound.
In the past, she said, every animal offered to the branch was saved.
But Mr Murphy said the Port Macquarie branch had gone through a considerable 
transition period and the new committee now had a "good grasp on reality".
He said the previous management's philosophy on re-homing, where they "saved 
everything" was irresponsible and inappropriate.
"These people are a cancer in terms of animal welfare," he said.
He also labelled those people wishing to see a policy of no-kill within the 
RSPCA as troglodytes. According to the Macquarie dictionary that is "people 
thought to be primitive, barbaric, unintelligent or insensitive". 
He said the philosophy of no-kill shelters was totally unrealistic.
Mr Murphy said the Port Macquarie shelter has one of the lowest euthanasia 
rates in the state. 
"These claims have been driven by people who have an unrealistic, 
irresponsible and naive expectations about re-homing every animal that arrives at our 
shelters.
"A ?no-kill' policy sounds a wonderful idea but in theory does not work. 
"Someone is left to deal with the problem of unwanted animals, and that ?
someone', in most cases, is the RSPCA."
Mr Murphy said not only is there a lack of homes for unwanted animals, the 
RSPCA has a policy of not adopting aggressive or unhealthy animals into the </docText>

Athens -- As it struggles to complete its odyssey of pre- Olympics primping, 
this scraggly city finds itself pressed to prove more than its ability to pave 
roads, plant trees and prettify monuments. 
It has to show that it hasn't gone to the dogs. 
They are legion, and they are leashless. Strays saunter through public 
squares, tails wagging or teeth bared, depending on their dispositions and the 
nearness of meaty alms. Strays flank the gilded portals to fancy boutiques like 
furry, four-legged doormen with a naked hankering for table scraps. 
In an unfortunate, widely publicized incident last summer, one stray bit a 
Ukrainian archery coach who was in Athens for Olympic test events and out for a 
run. 
The wound was not serious, except to the scruffy image of Athens and its 
environs, whose caretakers are now trying, in a manner that might well be 
described as dogged, to tame the situation. 
Just a few months ago the national government enacted legislation meant to 
reduce the stray population by holding Greeks more accountable, with toughened 
pet registration requirements and stiff fines for abandoning their pets to the 
streets. 
People here apparently do that with some regularity, which city officials 
describe as the principal source of the problem. 
Athens, for its part, is funneling about $2 million this year into new animal 
shelters, more animal control officers and a major sterilization project. 
Stray by randy stray, dogs are being rounded up, neutered and then -- 
if they are not adopted in two weeks -- set free to roam anew, but in a less 
reproductive fashion. 
City officials concede that those combined efforts will not work fast enough 
to make a major difference by the beginning of the Olympic Games on Aug. 13, 
but they say there may be some benefit. </docText>

Marathon running is synonymous with carbo-loading. So what if you're on
the Atkins Diet?

Do you bacon-binge? Cheddar-load? Is it enough to skip the bun on a
double-bacon cheeseburger?

In other words, what if you haven't seen a bagel in six months and your
carbohydrate-rationed body now finds itself entered in the 26th running of
the Cowtown Marathon on Saturday?

"Truthfully, I think you'd be in trouble," said Fort Worth Runners Club
president Frank McGinty, who said he has run 52 marathons.

Two things are fairly consistent about marathon running: Your body needs
energy, and your body needs fuel.

Buddy, can you spare a carb? simply is not acceptable language around the
start of a 26.2-mile race.
...
Nancy Clark, a Brookline, Mass., sports nutritionist and author of two
books -- Food Guide for Marathoners and Sports Nutrition Guidebook --
makes it clear that she's not a proponent of the Atkins Diet for anyone,
much less a marathoner.
...
"[But] if you're on the Atkins Diet and trying to run a marathon, you
deplete muscle glycogen, which never gets replaced," Clark said. "Because
you're not taking in carbs, your muscles don't have the fuel to function.
... They just stop. Your body lacks stamina and endurance. Basically, it's
no fun to run."
...
"If foods high in carbohydrates are fattening, then why aren't marathon
runners fat?" Clark asked, rhetorically. "Carbs aren't fattening. Calories
are fattening. Lack of exercise is fattening."

Local marathon runner Michael Polansky, who operates Polansky Race
Management, has been a vegetarian since 1979. Carbs come easily.

AN ISLAND GP says it is only a matter of time before someone is killed in his area in a road accident caused by deer. 
Dr Julian Toms, based in Portree on Skye, has been prompted into collecting details of collisions after many of his patients and colleagues were involved in deer-related accidents. 
He is to pass his findings to his MSP and an Executive-backed research programme investigating deer collisions, which are seen as a significant and growing problem. 
It is estimated between 15,000 and 20,000 deer-related accidents occur in Scotland every year - about a quarter of the UK total - while at least nine people have died and ten been seriously injured in Scotland between 1996 and 2000. It is thought the accidents cost about 5 million a year, with another 1 million estimated in damage to vehicles. 
However, the current figures are only the tip of the iceberg, as accurate information on the scale of the problem, its geographical distribution, and accident black-spots is still lacking. 
Dr Toms said that since starting his study of the accident toll two weeks ago, he has been sent details of 11 road accidents involving deer which occurred in the last year, and is aware of another six collisions. Although none resulted in serious injury, the cost of damage to cars has ranged from 200 to 2,500. 
The most common accident hot spots are the A87 road, near the Cluanie Inn between Invermoriston and Kyle, and around Glenshiel in Wester Ross as well as between Broadford and Kyleakin in Skye. 
"I had an accident myself three weeks ago at Glenshiel when I hit a red deer hind. 
"My car is still being repaired at a cost of several thousand pounds. This was a Land Rover and had it been a smaller vehicle the hind may have come through the windscreen. 
"I work in a partnership of six doctors and now three of us have hit deer in the last 18 months. 
"I have a letter from a woman who was involved in an accident and who is now very afraid of driving on this road, so it's affecting people quite badly and making them hesitant about driving, particularly at night and in the winter." 
Dr Toms said many similar accidents go unreported each year and is to suggest that a system is introduced making reporting to police compulsory.He added: "A member of staff at the local hospital was in an accident when the deer came through the windscreen and right into the vehicle. An animal that weight and size could cause major injuries. 
"The other problem is that people try to avoid deer on the road and there is a risk of hitting another vehicle." 
Dr Toms's action has been welcomed by Professor Rory Putman, who is collecting information on deer accidents in Scotland as part of a two-year UK-wide project to develop a national register and highlight the scale of the problem and the worst affected areas. 
Prof Putman said researchers are now getting more complete details of accidents involving human injuries from all police forces, as well as information from insurance companies for claims to vehicles, from councils who have to remove deer carcasses, trunk road agencies and the Forestry Commission, stalkers, the Scottish Society for the Protection of Animals and members of the public. 
He said: "The information from people like Dr Toms will help us get more objective estimates of the number of incidents arising in Scotland and identify the hot spots." 
Ongoing research may help efforts towards preventative measures. These include removing roadside vegetation, erecting fencing to direct deer to a safer crossing point; reflectors which give a flash warning when they reflect headlights; and high-frequency whistles fitted on cars.

 With New York in the grips of another frigid winter, the city's top
designers obviously feel the time is right to go for fur in a big way.

At the recent fall 2004 collections, the fur flew. "It's in every single
show, it's everywhere," says Hal Rubenstein, fashion features director of
In Style magazine. "It's used with the same frequency that people use
satin and wool."

"All I see is fur," says Kate Betts, editor of Time's special style and
design magazine. "It's everywhere. It's luxurious and special, and that's
what people will be trading up to next fall."
...
 In Style's Rubenstein points to a move away from understated luxury.
"We're back to evening glamour with lots of big jewels," he says. "It's
logical that people want other examples that state a certain level of
luxury, and fur is a way to do it."

So true, says Lisa Franzetta, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA). Franzetta, who attended the recent Fashion
Week and was dismayed to see so much fur on the runways. "Sadly," she
says, "some people have reacted to Sept. 11 by getting really
self-absorbed and selfish, and wearing fur is one of the ways we've seen
that arrogance manifested."

Franzetta says she finds it interesting that many designers using fur are
disguising it, shearing the pelts or dying them bright colors. "We're at
the point," she says, "that people need to be reminded that fur comes from
animals."

On the other hand, Franzetta says, PETA is encouraged that there is a
significant amount of faux fur available as well. It shows, she says, that
"you can have a look that reflects the beauty of animals" without causing
them "hideous suffering."</docText>

        <docText>U.S. foodmakers are scrambling to satisfy
consumer clamorings for low-carbohydrate products but also see a move
toward more balanced eating that could spell doom for the strictest
low-carb diets, like Atkins.

At an industry conference last week in Scottsdale, Arizona, companies
including Kellogg Co. and Hershey Foods Corp. touted products such as
low-carb cereals and chocolate bars catering to the millions of Americans
following diets that eschew carbohydrates like bread, sugar and pasta in
favor of high-protein foods and those made with sugar alternatives.

But even as they push these new products, companies which have been hurt
by the backlash against carbohydrates expect consumers will soon back off
the more extreme low-carb diets due to growing concerns about their intake
of artery-clogging fat and cholesterol.

Recent studies have put the number of Americans following low-carb diets
at anywhere from 10 million to 24 million. 
...
The negative reports about Atkins, which prompted a flurry of headlines
across the globe labeling him "Dr. Fatkins," come on top of numerous
public attacks by low-fat diet gurus such as Dr. Dean Ornish and nutrition
advocacy groups.

Late last year, the vegetarian group Physician's Committee for Responsible
Medicine created buzz by saying the Atkins diet could lead to heart
disease and may have contributed to the death of one teen-age dieter.

"You're beginning to see some publications and some articles about taking
these diets to an extreme," Kellogg Chairman and CEO Carlos Gutierrez told
reporters at the conference. "All these small events, whether it's
somebody on the news or whether it's a magazine article, they chip away at
the diet."

Kellogg is addressing concerns about the strictest low-carb diets in a new
television commercial for its Morningstar Farms vegetarian burgers and
patties, which the company says are naturally low in carbs. In the
commercial, a voice questions whether low-carb diets are being taken too
far, while a woman is overheard ordering veal chops, ribs, buffalo wings
and a burger without the bun. </docText>

 People have set up an organization to help reduce the suffering of
 all these animals in Romania.  They are smartly dividing their
 efforts into two parts - one for rescue and one for humane education.
  Each to utilize 50% of all manpower and financial resources so as
 not to die off from  the 'tail chasing' deaths so many rescuers
 face due to exhaustion.
 They could still use ideas and prayers from everyone.
 
 
 
 Dear 21st Century Animal Resource,
 
 I am so impressed with you and 21st Cares!  I want to introduce the
 Romania Animal Rescue, Inc. to you.  We were founded last year as a
 result of a Romanian hiking tour.  My friends and I were horrified at
 the suffering and neglect of thousands of stray street dogs in every
 city and town in Romania!  We formed RAR, now a US 501 c 3
 corporation, to help legitimate organizations and citizens in Romania
 to set up spay/neuter facilities and life care for infirmed animals
 of Romania.  We have been successful in finding a partner to work
 with in Galati, and she is wonderful.  We have been able to set up
 our first shelter and clinic there, thanks to my representative Dana
 Costin from ROLDA.  
 
 I need some advise from you as to how you would go about getting the
 word out to the civilized world about what is going on in Romania. 
 The govt. has no compassion for these animals, and has massive
 slaughter campaigns whereby they send out killing squads to poison,
 club, or kick the dogs to death.  This is not the solution to the
 problem, obviously, or these dogs would not keep coming back and
 causing this over-population crisis.  Often when the word gets out
 about the horrible condition of the strays, the Romanian govt. is
 embarrassed and has a slaughter campaign to clean up the dogs and
 pretend that they have solved the problem "humanely" (out of sight,
 out of mind, you know?).  In most cities, the govt. taxes the
 citizens and says it is spaying/neutering dogs with the $, but we
 have checked these dogs and found that they are in tact.  The
 authorities just keep the $, and the people are frustrated with
 having to pay the taxes and angry with the dogs, and so the neglect
 and abuse is rampant.  I have been told that Romania has the highest
 stray dog population of any country in the world, and I believe this
 to be the case.  
 
 Our shelter has a spay/neuter release program, and we have over
 10,000 dogs in our city alone to care for.  I am being asked for help
 throughout Romania, but have decided I can get the most done by
 focussing on one successful program at a time.  With our program, we
 only keep dogs incapable of street life at our shelter for life care,
 (crippled, blind, etc.).  It is a sanctuary for dogs - a clean,
 spacious and loving environment.  We have parasite medications that
 we use to keep them happy and healthy, and feed the best food we can
 find - which is another problem - and we want to start making our own
 healthy dry dog food at a reasonable price for us and the people of
 Romania.  Right now dog food costs as much as it is in the US-
 sometimes more - and is often out of date and spoiled.  Many problems
 there...
 Any help you can advise?
 Sincerely, and sorry to ramble on, but I am interested in those of
 you with knowledge and experience helping us.

In the 1800s, when Jim Slaughter opened his grocery store in rural
Oklahoma, just south of Norman on a bend in the road that was to become
Highway 77, he had no idea that more than 100 years later, his name
would be used to define the area. In 1970, local residents, determined
to keep the area rural and alarmed at the prospect of being incorporated
into the rapidly-growing city of Norman, preserved their independent
status by incorporating their own town. 
They named the town Slaughterville because the name was already included
as Slaughter's Corner on many maps of the state, and the founders felt
that an easy-to-recognize name would help to identify the town.
According to the current town manager, Slaughterville has struggled ever
since to overcome "the stigma of an unusual name." 

Not only is Slaughterville an unusual name, it is also a name that calls
to mind the violence of the meat industry and serial killers. 

Slaughterhouses are among the most violent places on Earth. According to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and former slaughterhouse workers,
cattle routinely have their limbs hacked off and their skin ripped from
their bodies while fully conscious-they are literally dismembered while
alive. Pigs are routinely drowned in tanks of scalding-hot water
designed for hair removal. And chickens have it worst of all: Their
frail legs are snapped into metal shackles, their throats are slit open,
and they are scalded to death in feather-removal tanks, and they, too,
are often fully conscious throughout the process. 

PETA is sure that the good people of Slaughterville are a kind and
compassionate bunch, and we hope that they will not be afraid to change
their town's name to reflect their compassion. 

That's why we're asking the town of Slaughterville to change its name to
Veggieville &lt;slaughtervilleLetter.pdf . We'll even throw in $20,000
worth of healthy veggie burgers for the local school district to
celebrate the change. Veggie burgers, which are friendly to humans and
animals, are high in protein, high in fiber, low in fat, and contain
zero cholesterol or animal suffering-a great way to feed Veggieville's
kids!

March of Delegates and Kucinich Volunteers starting at 96th Street and
Broadway (southwest corner in front of Rite-Aid) where we will meet at
11:00 am.  
 
NYC Friends of Kucinich is providing posters on cardboard tubes and some
literature.  If you have any literature left on Saturday which we can
distribute along the route of march, please bring it.  Delegates, if you
would like to make some sort of sign to wear or carry identifying
yourself as a candidate for delegate, please do so.
 
We will march on the sidewalk up Broadway to 125th Street where we will
make a turn.  We will then walk across 125th Street to Lexington Avenue. 
At that point, those who wish to continue will take the A train up to
181st Street, from where we will march down to 165th Street.   
 
If we have not already told me you are definitely participating (or not)
in the March, please call me  or send me an email reply
ASAP.  If you are a Washington Heights/Inwood person and want to meet us
up there, please let me know now so we can arrange the logistics of
timing with you.
 
There are a few other items as well.
 
First, in these remaining days, please try to get out and leaflet as much
as possible ? in any moments you can spare.  It is also helpful to call
and email any undecided friends and family to try to convince them to
vote for Dennis.
 
Second, please let me know if you would like lists of prime voters whom
you can call.  Scripts and instructions are included.  By the way, if you
have phone numbers of people you registered to vote, be sure to call them
on Monday, March 1st and remind them to vote for Dennis.
 
Finally, please let me know if you will be able to pass out our beautiful
new palm cards at the specified distance from your polling place on
Primary Day.  Even if you have an hour before or after work, that would
be wonderful!  We will have the cards for you at the March ? or you can
pick them up from me, I can get them to you or you can download them and
print them yourself from www.nycfordennis.com.
 
I look forward to hearing from you in the next day or two by reply email

On October 20, 2003, two Gatesville city employees found a friendly kitten 
wandering in a local park and took her back to their workshop to provide 
care for her until they could find a suitable home for her. The next day, 
one of their coworkers, Butch Barton, allegedly hacked off the kitten's 
tail with his pocket knife. Unbelievably, cruelty-to-animals charges have 
not been filed against Barton!

Under Texas' anti-cruelty statute, it is a blatant violation of law to 
intentionally or knowingly torture an animal - regardless of whether the 
animal has a known owner or guardian. Gatesville's district attorney stated 
that even feral animals are protected by this statute but that it is up to 
the county attorney to prosecute this case. The county attorney is refusing 
to prosecute, claiming that he has not received any information about this 
case from law-enforcement officials. Meanwhile, Gatesville Chief of Police 
J.C. Burch has declined to forward the case to the county attorney, 
erroneously claiming that criminal charges are not merited because the 
kitten did not have an owner
PETA continues to be inundated with telephone calls from Coryell County 
residents about this disturbing case, and we are strongly urging 
authorities to pursue criminal charges against Barton for his alleged 
actions. 

Please contact the chief of police and urge him to investigate this crime 
as he would any other and to file appropriate charges. Please also contact 
the county prosecutor to ask him to vigorously prosecute Barton - for the 
sake of the community as well as its animals:

In order not to detract from our campaign, it is imperative that all 
correspondence be polite and dignified.

For more than 30 years, the Atkins Diet has been going against the grain,
recommending high-protein foods that often are associated with various
ills, from colon cancer to heart disease.

That hasn't stopped millions of Americans from bellying up to the Atkins
bar, which was bolstered late last year when two short-term studies showed
the diet to be healthier than anyone expected.

But doctors, nutritionists and other experts are not certain of the
long-term health effects. Nor do they all agree with findings that
indicate Atkins may be as good for you as it is effective.
...
People should not interpret last year's studies as proof that Atkins is
safe and healthful, although that is likely just what dieters are doing,
said Dr. George Blackburn, director of the Center for the Study of
Nutrition Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard
University.
...
In a six-month study involving 132 severely obese men and women,
researchers at the Philadelphia Veteran Affairs Medical Center last year
found those on a restricted-carbohydrate diet not only lost more weight
than those on a conventional diet, but also had reduced levels of
triglycerides, which contribute to heart disease.

In a similar yearlong study finished last year by Dr. Gary Foster at the
University of Pennsylvania, those on the Atkins Diet lost the same amount
of weight as those on a reduced-fat diet, but experienced lower
triglyceride levels as well as an increase in HDL, the "good" cholesterol.

Foster said he was surprised when his study found the Atkins Diet did not
increase cholesterol, given the proven perils of fatty food. And he was
shocked by the increased levels of HDL.
...
Not all doctors and nutritionists have been swayed by Foster's earlier
study, the results of which were published in November in the New England
Journal of Medicine.

The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which promotes a
vegetarian diet, issued a warning about Atkins and other high-protein,
low-carb diets, saying risks of long-term use include colorectal cancer,
heart disease, osteoporosis and impaired kidney function. Dr. Carol
Johnston, a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University who has
published two studies on the reduced-carb Zone Diet, said the Foster study
was fatally flawed, invalidating its "questionable" results.

The biggest problem, Johnston said, was that participants were not
rigorously monitored, allowing them to cheat on the diets. Her suspicion
was borne out when Johnston, who analyzed Foster's study, found that 40
percent of the Atkins dieters were not in ketosis, a condition in which
the body burns fat because there are no energy stores supplied by
carbohydrates. Atkins depends on ketosis for weight loss.

Editors note: Last month, North Bay Bohemian news editor R. V. Scheide
began following the dietary principles outlined in Dr. Atkins' New Diet
Revolution, the bestselling book that sparked the low-carbohydrate diet
craze more than a decade ago. While millions of people claim to have lost
weight following low-carb regimens, such diets continue to have
detractors, many of whom consider the practice unhealthy, even dangerous.
In the name of strictest science, we asked R. V. to keep a diary of his
first month on the Atkins diet. The following excerpts are neither an
endorsement nor a refutation of such diets, but rather the field notes of
one person's anecdotal experience, submitted here for the public, satiric
and scientific record.
...
Wednesday, Jan. 14. The militant vegan at work discovered this morning
that I am on the Atkins diet and wigged out. She's always trying to get
everyone to quit eating meat. "Didn't you get that e-mail I sent you with
all the information about how bad Atkins is?" she asked, exasperated. I'd
deleted it, but I didn't tell her that.

My body feels like it's eating itself from the inside out. My buddy hasn't
noticed the effect yet, but I can literally feel the fat melting away. My
mood has stabilized along with my metabolism, in much the same way I
imagine lithium soothes the manic depressive. It is not an unpleasant
feeling, a sort of mild, foggy euphoria. I call it "ketosis psychosis." 
...
We're both now deeply in the throes of ketosis psychosis. It takes me
forever to get out of the house in the morning. I keep forgetting things.
I go back to the bedroom for the keys, but when I get there, I forget what
I came back for. I repeat this two or three times for each item I forget:
keys, wallet, underwear, etc. I call this having an "Atkins moment."
...
Tuesday, Feb. 10. It's all over the news. The Wall Street Journal broke a
story today claiming that Dr. Atkins was obese at the time of his death
and died of congestive heart failure. Atkins' critics suggest his diet was
the true cause of death. His family claims the weight gain was due to
fluid that built up during the 12 days the doctor spent in a coma. His
wife complains that the Journal has violated their privacy by revealing
confidential medical information.

It's a sad story, and it's hard not to think there is something a little
screwy about the Atkins diet. I've lost 15 pounds in four weeks--no diet
I've ever tried has produced such dramatic results. I've gained a new
appreciation for controlling the amount of carbohydrates I eat--which
makes sense for any balanced diet. But I think I've had enough of the
induction phase. Too spacy. It's time to start adding some carbs to my regime.

A tangelo seems like a good enough place to start.</docText>

It's a testament to the optimism of memory that I've forgotten how my bedroom 
smelled after a bad night or how it felt to carry Lydia up and down stairs 
when the elevators weren't working during the blackout last summer or how much 
those vet visits ended up costing. I miss her. Her absence has punched a hole 
in my world. The span of her life took in a marriage, the birth of my son and 
two moves. I wrote and published five books, and dozens of columns and articles 
with Lydia under the desk. When we bought her at a kennel in upstate New York 
and named her Lydia Littledog, I promised her breeder I was going to move to 
the country soon. I never got around to that.

I don't even know how to grieve a person's death. I haven't visited my 
father's grave in years. I tell myself that other ways in which I remember him - 
talking about him and writing about him - are more important. I used to say that 
of Elisabeth K?bler-Ross' famous stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, 
depression and acceptance - I seemed to be stuck in the first two stages.

A lot of grief is the fear of unanswerable questions. Are the dead still with 
us somehow, as they often seem to be? Or are mind and soul trapped in the 
body? Are my father and Lydia up in heaven, taking one of the long walks through 
the birchy New Hampshire woods they both loved? Is he talking to her about his 
work, and is she looking back at him with her doggy disdain for human 
worries? He would have a dog biscuit in the pocket of his frayed chinos and stop to 
give Lydia's soft head a reassuring pat.

"It's OK, girl," he would say. "We'll be home soon."</docText>

        <docText>Intalio, Inc., the 
Business Process Management company, today announced that the Dutch Animal Health 
Service, which issues health certificates for farm animals, has chosen Intalio/n3 
to be the core technology for their new central certification system to more 
efficiently monitor the health of livestock. The new system will also enable 
the service to more quickly adapt and implement certification programs, and to 
react more efficiently to animal disease outbreaks like Foot &amp; Mouth disease. 
The central system will complement the service with the ability to process 
foreign health data. 


Intalio/n3, the platform-neutral BPM system from Intalio, Inc., will be the 
core technology for the new system to be named COS-B. Intalio/n3 will bundle 
the existing systems and act as a faster and more efficient central system to 
control and monitor the existing programs. Dutch IT integrator and services 
company PerfectConnection and Belgian BPMS specialist Alexsys Consulting, will 
handle the implementation project. 
Information Technology is crucial in executing and monitoring the 
certification programs of the Dutch Animal Health Service, as computer systems track the 
processes for issuing and attaining a health certificate. In addition, 
computers register who is responsible for executing the related actions for each 
process. Based on this data, the systems initiate the necessary actions and send 
messages to the people involved, such as livestock farmers, veterinarians and 
lab technicians. Furthermore, IT organizes the sending of reminders during the 
processes and then the timely delivery of the results. </docText>

Raising buffalo began as a hobby for Steve Fruechte and has expanded into a 
business and some international trade.

"In 1993, I heard that a fellow had some buffalo for sale, and I had a lot of 
pasture that wasn?t in use," the Caledonia farmer explained. 

"My wife, Linda, and I went to look at them and decided to purchase 10 head. 
What began as a hobby grew and grew, and now I have almost 200 head. Around 50 
of them are cows."

On most days, motorists can see Fruechte?s herd of buffalo in fields along 
Highway #44 about six miles east of Spring Grove.

As members of national and state associations and by meeting other buffalo 
growers, they have learned and continue to keep informed about raising buffalo, 
the largest American animal.

Fruechte markets buffalo meat in the area and has also sold live animals to 
Cuba.

Largest American animal

Great herds of American bison, or "buffalo," once roamed the western plains 
of North America. By the late 1800s the widespread killing of buffalo for their 
hides threatened to wipe out these great beasts.

To prevent the whole species from becoming extinct, the U.S. government 
established game laws and other protective measures that allowed the surviving 
bison to live and multiply.</docText>

Susan Gardner of Orleans and her daughters didn't see the accident when it 
happened last June, but they heard the screech and knew it was bad. 
"It was, 'Uh oh. Which dog got it? Oh, no,'" she said. 
Sadly, the dog that had been hit by the truck was their own dog Mellow, who 
had been across the street playing with other dogs. 
"He just ran in front of a truck," Gardner said. "The fur, the skin was off 
the bone." 
Gardner took Mellow to Eastham Veterinary Hospital, but the situation looked 
grim. Surgery or amputation was possible, but even the $1,500 for amputation 
was too steep for Gardner, a mother of four. 
"We were all set to put him down because we couldn't afford the surgery," she 
said. 
But then an employee suggested applying to the Sampson Fund for Veterinary 
Care, an Orleans-based nonprofit organization that helps pay veterinary expenses 
at participating animal hospitals, including Eastham Veterinary Hospital. 
Gardner agreed, and Mellow's leg was amputated. 
"Mellow went through the surgery fine, the amputation," Gardner said. "He was 
home in two days. He gets along better than he did with four legs. He bounced 
back really quick." 
Mellow is one of the fund's success stories since it was founded in 1986 with 
a $25 donation to Harwich veterinarian Christopher Donner. The Sampson Fund 
assists animals in need of substantial veterinary care but whose owners may not 
have the money. Participating veterinarians cut their costs by 20 percent, 
and then the owner pays a small percentage. The fund picks up the rest. 
The fund is named in honor of Sampson, a stray cat whose owners gave the 
money to Donner to help another animal. 
"The fund grew from there," fund vice president Bob Bourgoin said. "We took 
care of 42 animals in 2003 at a cost of $14,000.</docText>

An Animal Defenders International Rescue Team has traveled
to Zimbabwe and secured a CITES confiscation order from the 
Ministry of Agriculture for four tigers, six lions, and an 
African Python from Assan Circus. Ten dogs and two horses 
were also seized on welfare grounds. These animals were handed 
into the care of Animal Defenders International who are currently
seeking new homes.  A. Hassan, owner of the circus, has apparently
fled the country and cannot be located.

If you have any information about Mr. Hassan or the circus, please

Finally, on Thursday, a whisper of hope. Someone had heard the sound of a 
truck near Bombardopolis, where about 200 children live in the group's orphanage. 
Then, on Friday, Chatman was able to reach a contact in Port-au-Prince who 
had spoken with someone in the village. 

"Everything?" Chatman asked upon hearing the truck had made it. "Praise the 
Lord!" 


Missing for almost a month, the truck and its load of food had been hidden in 
Gonaives as the driver tried to persuade the rebels who held the city to 
allow the shipment through. Finally, the rebel leader relented, even providing 
armed guards to protect the truck from bandits. 

For the missionaries, the shipment represents one of many "miracles" they 
have witnessed, as they face one trial after another during their work in Haiti. 
The rebellion that swept the country during the past month and the sudden 
departure of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide are only the latest challenges. 

Chatman, 63, first visited Haiti in 1975, during a catastrophic drought that 
struck the northwest particularly hard. He only intended to go once, planning 
to focus his evangelist and missionary efforts in India. But he said he felt 
called by God once he saw the conditions in Haiti. 

"I visited villages where people told me they had lost half their families," 
he said. "They had eaten the big animals first, then dogs and cats, then rats 
and bugs. Some of them were eating bark to get by. 

"If you've ever seen that, you'll be changed." </docText>

We saw this in the recent phony "Jobs Creation Act." We are seeing it
again in the "Livestock Siting Bill" (AB 868) which is currently churning
through the Wisconsin's legislature. This bill will facilitate the
establishment of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), also
known as "factory farms," and will restrict, if not eliminate, the ability
of local government to limit those operations.

Factory farms/CAFOs can only operate if they have a Wisconsin Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit. These farms are regulated
under the Federal Clean Water Act and state water law because of their
potential to negatively impact water resources. The WPDES permit regulates
where and how much waste can be spread on fields, how the waste is
temporarily stored in lagoons, and the design of a permanent runoff
control system. It's a fairly simple matter of regulating the amount of
cow or piggy poo that will get into your well water or nearby creek.

        <docText>According to a recent survey, 
veterinarians believe fleas will be the number one health risk for pets this 
spring and summer. This issue is most important for cats, identified by 
respondents as the pet least protected from these parasites by their owners. 
Merial, maker of FRONTLINE? and HEARTGARD? (ivermectin) brand products, 
surveyed more than 300 veterinarians and vet clinic staff at the 2004 North 
American Veterinary Conference between January 17-21 in Orlando, Fla. The survey 
determined which parasites veterinarians believe will pose the greatest health 
risks to pets as warmer weather arrives. 
Fifty percent of those surveyed named fleas atop the list of parasites that 
constitute the most significant medical issues in their practice. Vets and 
their staff voiced particular concern about cats and fleas, with 70 percent of 
respondents saying cat owners don't pay enough attention to protecting their pets 
from the parasite. 
According to Dr. Zack Mills, Executive Director, Veterinary Services of 
Merial, "A vast majority of cat owners do not understand the importance of flea 
control in cats and that the use of preventives, such as FRONTLINE?, are 
effective in treating and controlling fleas. Even indoor cats, especially those who 
live with a dog in the household, should be protected from fleas that may cause 
painful diseases such as flea allergy dermatitis. Pet owners need to take 
precautions in order to prevent flea infestation both on their pets and in their 
homes." </docText>

The catfight's over in the Stillwater Place neighborhood. 
Actually, it wasn't as much of a catfight as it was a fight over cats. 
Specifically, they were four large wildcats - one cougar and three servals - that 
neighborhood resident Gary Dutcher kept in pens in the back yard of his home on 
Chapel Bend Drive. 
Stillwater's neighborhood association sued Dutcher last week, seeking an 
injunction to force him to remove the animals. Allen Superior Judge Stanley Levine 
granted the request Feb. 24, but only after learning the issue is all but 
over - Dutcher moved the cats to an undisclosed location in Steuben County on 
Feb. 26, and the bank that holds the mortgage on his home has foreclosed, forcing 
the property to be sold. 
Instead of a confrontation, Tuesday's hearing was a quiet affair that saw 
Dutcher and representatives of the association's board agree to a preliminary 
injunction that prohibits him from keeping any more wild animals on his property. 
Dutcher told Levine he will vacate the home by early April. 
Under questioning by Levine and association attorney Dan McNamara, Dutcher 
said he moved the cats to Steuben County under supervision of the Department of 
Natural Resources and the Steuben County Sheriff's Department. He did not say 
where they were being kept, but said the facility is regulated by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and the animals are safe and well cared for.</docText>

Thanks to cheap flights and a fascination with the environment, ecotourism is 
one of the fastest-growing sectors of the travel industry. But scientists 
have now discovered that it may harm the very species it is meant to help. 
Charles Arthur reports on the dangers behind a growing trend
04 March 2004 
The silence is nerve-tingling. The lioness is poised to spring on her prey, 
in the dusty African savannah. Then comes the attack: a struggle, a bite, and 
the antelope is downed, and dying.
And that is followed by a new sound: walkie-talkies crackling to life with 
urgent messages, the gunning of Land Rover engines as another score of tourists 
are driven to the site of the kill to gawp at one of the world's 
fastest-dwindling species living out its life. To the bewildered lioness, the clicking of 
camera shutters and the sight of rhinoceros-sized metal beasts is just 
something she has to deal with - even, or especially, when she is eating. And these 
days, many companies will be happy to label such a trip "ecotourism".
"That's the worst kind of ecotourism," said Dr Nigel Dunstone, lecturer in 
zoology at the University of Durham, who has been investigating the effects of 
ecotourism on animal species since 1985. "But the real problem is that it has 
become too big a category. You can even find some white-water rafting holidays 
being called 'ecotourism'. It can cover everything from holidays where 
everything you do is sustainable, including the way you get to the destination and 
what you do there, right through to places that just concrete over a huge area 
for a landing strip and put up a great big concrete hotel."</docText>

Capping a six-year effort to correct a series of deficiencies identified in 
1998 by a professional accreditation committee, the Wisconsin Veterinary 
Diagnostic Laboratory (WVDL) has regained its full accreditation status, according 
to the chair of the board that oversees the lab. 
B.J. Cadman, chair of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory board 
and a practicing veterinarian in Ridgeland, Wis., says the lab was informed of 
its reaccreditation last week by the American Association of Veterinary 
Laboratory Diagnosticians. The reaccreditation, Cadman says, is essential to ensuring 
that Wisconsin's agricultural community and food producers have direct access 
to the best animal health diagnostic services available. 
"This is a pretty significant step, and is something our board has been 
working on for a long time," Cadman says. 
The lab is a key part of the state's animal health infrastructure. It 
provides testing and diagnostic services for all types of animals, especially farm 
animals. In recent years, it has assumed a very visible role in the state's 
battle against chronic wasting disease, testing more than 35,000 animals for the 
disease last year alone. In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the 
United States and the subsequent anthrax attacks, it has also assumed new 
responsibilities in the effort to thwart bioterrorism. 
The lab, which for many years was a part of the state Department of 
Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection - and was known as the Wisconsin Animal 
Health Laboratory - had been under funded and understaffed, and lacked effective 
leadership, according to a history of the lab. 
In 1998, when the lab's accreditation was reduced to "provisional" status, it 
"brought to a head some of the budgetary and administrative challenges which 
our laboratory had dealt with for the past 15 to 20 years," Cadman says. </docText>

The University has seen many interesting phenomena in recent years,
including half-naked men with masks peering into windows and irate
preachers toting 20-foot signs declaring the damnation of the entire campus.

But an even more perplexing phenomenon has been the suicidal ideation of
the campus squirrels.

The squirrels' quiet scurrying remains at the Capstone, but the power
outages, damaged electrical equipment and thousands of dollars worth of
damage have somehow discontinued this year.

Why have the squirrels' desperate, life-ending cries for help ceased?

Danny Glover, division operations manager at Alabama Power, said much of
the squirrels' salvation is due to the intervention of squirrel guards and
rodent blocks, part of the company's reliability effort initiative.
...
Grant Hiatt, a member of the Alabama Animal Rights Fellowship, said that
like the meat industry, it is obvious that animal health and safety is
closely related to humans' health and safety.

A perfect example of that principle is the past squirrel problems on
campus, he said.

"Sure, it would be expensive to squirrel guard, but the benefit for
de-squirreling [electrical equipment] outweighs the cost," he said. "The
squirrels are an integral part of the Quad, and I am sure they have been
in recruitment literature. We should do our part and make sure they are
not electrocuted."

Hiatt said that when he reflects on the mindset of a squirrel, he thinks
of young children and how they must be sheltered and protected from
dangers in the world.</docText>

Police arrested a Wheatfield area woman after officials found more than a 
dozen dead or severely malnourished horses on her Jasper County farm. 
?They (county officers) said I wasn?t feeding the horses, but they wouldn?t 
let me feed them before I was taken to jail,? Deborah Turoci said from the 
back door of her home along Indiana 49 on Wednesday afternoon. 
Turoci, 51, was arrested on charges of cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor, and 
failure to dispose of dead animals, a felony. 
Seven of the horses were dead, and county highway workers had to use heavy 
machinery to remove the carcasses because some were frozen to the ground, 
authorities said. 
If convicted, Turoci could face from six months to three years in prison and 
a $10,000 fine. She was released from jail on $5,000 bond. 
Turoci lived in the house alone except for about 20 cats, police said. She 
also kept five dogs. Jasper County police Chief Deputy Terry Risner said the 
dogs were not fed properly and one had apparently eaten part of one of the horse 
carcasses. 
As she talked with a reporter Wednesday, cats peered out from behind storm 
door glass. A ?beware of the dog? sign hung on the door and behind the house 
were a large pickup and a horse trailer. There were no horses on the property 
where she said she has lived for 14 years. 
Police searched her farm north of County Road 1400N on Friday after receiving 
complaints from neighbors, Risner said. Officials had ordered Turoci to bury 
or remove six dead horses a week earlier and to properly care for the others. 
But Risner said Turoci made no effort to dispose of the dead animals, and 
allowed a 
7-month-old colt to die without euthanasia. 
Turoci said when some horses died while the ground was frozen she couldn?t 
bury them. She said her tractor also broke down. She said two died the same time 
Feb. 14 or 15, which is usual. 
The surviving horses were taken to an undisclosed animal rescue shelter, 
police said. Veterinarians believe the animals can be saved. </docText>

Newswise ? When 15 students in a brand-new Mississippi State University 
academic course shoulder their backpacks and head to class, textbooks aren?t their 
major concern. 
In addition to their normal note-taking tools, they?re packing fingerprint 
powder, evidence markers and cotton swabs. 
The students are a new breed of forensic scientists?those learning to 
investigate crimes against wildlife and the great outdoors. In a class being taught 
at MSU for the first time this semester by the husband-wife team of Richard 
Minnis and Clare Chesnavage, the future forensic scientists are getting hands-on 
training in tracking crimes ranging from hunting out of season to importing 
restricted animals. 
The teaching duo is making academic history with their effort. ?Mississippi 
State is the only university in North America offering a course in wildlife 
forensics and one of a few universities offering a degree in wildlife law 
enforcement,? Minnis noted. 
To develop the course, Minnis did his homework. The assistant research 
professor in the College of Forest Resources, also a deputy for the Oktibbeha County 
sheriff?s office, interviewed several forensic laboratories around the United 
States. He received assistance from Chesnagave, who has worked for the Naval 
Criminal Investigative Service on cold cases and as a medical technologist in 
laboratories for more than 15 years. 
?Wildlife crime scenes are outdoors and cover an extremely large area, unlike 
most traditional crime scenes, which are indoors and very small,? Minnis 
explained. ?In this course, we have to be innovative and alter the techniques used 
in traditional forensics to adapt them for wildlife.? </docText>

After members of Takoma Park's food co-op voted nearly 3 to 1 last March
to keep the word "vegetarian" out of the organization's mission statement,
the member-owned grocery store took a dramatic step in February to better
compete with other retailers.

Starting last month, meat products started appearing on the shelves and in
the refrigerated and frozen food cases of the Takoma Park Silver Spring
Co-op's store in Takoma Junction.

It wasn't an easy decision for the store's management, especially since
the store was completely vegetarian -- albeit unofficially -- for the
previous 22 years.

"It was a tremendously difficult decision," said Bob Atwood, the co-op's
general manager, but a decision reached after consulting with members and
explaining the economics of the situation.
...
Convenience aside, the move to meat has received mixed reactions from
members of the area's vegetarian community. Former co-op member Paul
Shapiro of Takoma Park said he has heard complaints from members of
Compassion Over Killing, the animal rights and vegetarian advocacy group
he founded.

Shapiro said he is concerned the co-op never formally polled its members
on the specific question of selling meat at the Takoma Park store,
although Atwood said the membership vote last year was, in essence, a
referendum on selling meat.

Shapiro, who withdrew his co-op membership over the question of selling
animal products, also questioned some of the meat products sold in the
store, saying that he called several of the companies whose products were
labeled free-range, and that some of the companies didn't actually offer
free-range products.

"There are some people for whom 'factory farming' [where animals are
confined versus roaming freely] is the issue, while others say it's
unethical to unnecessarily kill animals," Shapiro said.

"We now have what was an all-vegetarian co-op selling some, but not all,
'factory farm' products," he added.</docText>

        <docText>Big, white, fluffy Great Pyrenees dogs are called "Gentle 
Giants." Three-year-old Charlie is one of them. 
Last week, the formerly emaciated dog became the house companion for 
Edenbrook of Plano, an assisted-living center. He was placed by SPIN, a rescue group 
called Saving Pyrs in Need. 
President Cindy Tuttle says SPIN formed last November to deal with the 
growing number of abandoned or mistreated Pyrs in North and East Texas. People often 
misjudge their abilities to care for such a big critter. It arrives as a 
small, fluffy puppy, but can grow to be 130 pounds. Not a lap dog. 
Charlie is SPIN's first assisted-living-center dog. The SPINsters are happy 
to place any of their 20 rescued dogs in other homes, too.  
Edenbrook executive director Debra Denney says Sunrise Senior Living acquired 
the facility last fall and "requires its communities to have a dog." She 
found an ad in The Dallas Morning News classifieds for Petfinder (www.pet 
finder.com) and posted a "dog needed" notice. SPIN responded. 
As it turns out, the Great Pyrenees is the right size. Residents don't have 
to bend over to pet him, and he's the right height to greet someone in a 
wheelchair. He's practically perfect ? and he has 65 residents and 65 staffers 
looking out for his well-being. </docText>

Local entrepreneur enjoys success with her own line of pet food 
A healthy dog is a happy dog. Just ask Linda Murdock, a local entrepreneur 
who created a recipe of dog food good enough for human consumption. 
Putting her money where her mouth is, Murdock broke a dog biscuit in half, 
took a bite from one half and said, "Here, try one," as she handed an 
unsuspecting reporter the other half. 
"All the ingredients are natural," Murdock said, offering a piece to the 
deliveryman, who politely declined, his facial expression making clear that he 
thought eating dog food was nuts. 
Murdock's company, Happy Dog, creates products that contain a nutritionally 
balanced blend of human-grade ingredients of the highest quality vegetables, 
whole grains, herbs and vitamin supplements. 
Soon after she began feeding her own dogs such nutritional products in the 
late 1980s, friends began asking Murdock to make them a batch of dog food. 
"Our food bill for two people was $400 a week because I was feeding many dogs 
in the neighborhood," she said. "Then my husband said I had to recoup what it 
cost me." 
However, it was not until 1997 that Murdock decided to go into business for 
herself. 
On a trip to Kansas City, the couple went to a mall, where they discovered 
the Three Dog Bakery chain, which features products for dogs such as a chocolate 
cake made from pur?ed liver. </docText>

How did the politics of Alaska wildlife get so divisive? 
These days we've got legislators on opposite sides of the philosophical 
divide trying to dictate that: 
? The best use of all Alaska big-game animals should be food. 
? The Board of Game should be restructured to give a larger say to 
"nonconsumptive" wildlife users, i.e. animal lovers. 
Has the entire process been taken over by extremists on opposite ends of the 
debate who share only one thing, a fundamental lack of understanding about 
Arctic and subarctic ecosystems? 
One group wants a moose behind every willow bush. 
The other wants wolves so plentiful as to make wolf viewing an easy and 
marketable activity. 
Neither is feasible, let alone realistic. 
Alaska is a far northern landscape. A short growing season restricts the 
diversity and productivity of plant life, limiting the number of herbivores it can 
support. The small number of prey species -- even counting Alaska's caribou 
herds, which look large because they cluster -- dictate that there will be food 
for only a limited number of predators. 
Man can manipulate this environment. Nonconsumptive users who think nature 
operates in some sort of sensible balance, are simply wrong. Look no further 
than Anchorage. The city is overrun with moose for one simple reason: It's a 
predator-free zone. 
Motor vehicles kill plenty of moose here every year, but they do not kill 
anywhere near as many as wild predators take. Still, you may have noticed you 
can't count on finding a moose in Anchorage anytime you want. Visiting tourist 
friends might drive around town for days and not spot a moose. 
It is worth noting that if we decided Anchorage moose should be consumed, we 
wouldn't feed many people. 
Unless we wanted to kill all 1,000 or so in one big bloodletting -- after 
which no one would ever see a moose in Anchorage again -- we might be able to 
remove 200 moose a year from this population. But cars already get more than 100. 
So the number of moose that hunters could shoot would be fewer than that. 
I'd like to shoot an Anchorage moose. I like moose meat, and the doggone 
critters are always getting up on my deck to eat our willows. It would be easy and 
convenient to dump a winter supply of meat right there outside the door. It's 
an Alaska village resident's fantasy. 
But I'm not sure it's the highest and best use of Anchorage's moose. I 
actually think it might be better if instead of using Anchorage moose to feed people 
-- the roadkills go to charity -- we started using Anchorage moose to feed 
wolves. 
I'm truly sympathetic with all those nonconsumptive users who want to see a 
wolf. That's tough to do in Alaska, and we could make it easier. We could 
create wolf-viewing areas by picking a place to dump the carcasses of moose killed 
on Anchorage roads or by wildlife officials. 
Yes, I know, there are those who might find this sort of animal feeding 
distasteful, but people feed wild birds all the time just to get the chance to see 
them and think that's wonderful.</docText>

A mosque stands against the background of oil towers placed in the Caspian 
Sea in Baku, Azerbaijan. A five-year-old cooperative project to clean up the 
Caspian has made partners out of feisty competitors Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, 
Turkmenistan and Kazakstan.



Last month, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakstan declared war 
... on the jellyfish. A particularly voracious species known as Mnemiopsis is 
munching happily on phytoplankton in the Caspian Sea, the building block for 
the sea's valuable fish stocks. As a result, they're wiping out sturgeon and 
every other type of fish. 
None of the five nations wants to see a repeat of what happened a few years 
ago in the Black Sea, when the Mnemiopsis biomass grew larger than the world's 
entire commercial fish catch. 
So the Caspian countries, spurred by their common jellyfish enemy, are 
coordinating under the umbrella of the Caspian Environment Program. A five-year-old 
cooperative project to clean up the Caspian, the CEP has made significant 
headway as well as willing partners out of feisty competitors. 
Environmental problems that cross borders have often raised tensions between 
nations. But a new generation of scholars and activists see in these problems 
an opportunity to bring nations closer together. 
From disputed territory between Peru and Ecuador to the China-Vietnam border, 
hot spots that could trigger war instead have shown potential to bring peace. 
Big political challenges persist, of course. But advocates point to a growing 
body of evidence that shows that working together to save the environment can 
begin to make peaceful neighbors of once-bickering nations. </docText>

Swimmers, kayakers and others who frequent the shoreline should be aware. If 
the beach where you plan to land is occupied by a snoozing seals, the marine 
mammals have priority and cannot be disturbed. 
At least, that's how the federal law is being enforced by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. But that interpretation could be significantly altered by 
the outcome of a civil hearing held last week in San Diego. 
The judge's ruling, which is not expected sooner than this summer, will be 
important to coastal communities nationwide where conflicts between humans and 
protected seals and sea lions are increasing. 
"Every case that gets to court is crucial," said Rebecca Lent, deputy 
director of the fisheries service, which is under the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. 
She said her agency is concerned that the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
remains too vague and would prefer language that is more precise. 
"We are trying to focus on those activities that truly have an impact on 
marine mammals," she said. 
After listening to attorneys for both sides argue for nearly four days over 
the meaning and intent of the 1972 protection act, Administrative Law Judge 
Parlen McKenna observed: "Maybe this case needs to go forward so some (legal) 
definitions can be made." 
The court case stems from an incident last March in which a group of swimmers 
caused a resident colony of harbor seals to stampede into the ocean from a 
pocket beach in La Jolla known as Children's Pool. The swim was intended to make 
a political statement that seals and humans should be allowed shared use of 
the public beach. Organizers insist it was not an act of civil disobedience. 
Nine of the approximately 25 swimmers ? only those who came ashore and 
displaced the seals ? were cited and issued $1,000 civil penalties for violating the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
A majority of the other swimmers returned to their starting point a 
quarter-mile north, after one of the frightened seals at Children's Pool attacked an 
advancing swimmer.</docText>

Description of affected population: chickens. No biosecurity measures had 
been applied on the affected production unit.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
speciessusceptiblecasesdeathsdestroyedslaughtered
aviapprox. 6,600......approx. 6,6000

Diagnosis: the infection was detected under the routine State monitoring 
programme for avian influenza.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic 
Laboratory.
Further testing (DNA sequencing and pathogenicity studies) is being conducted 
at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.
B. Diagnostic tests used: serological agar-gel immunodiffusion test and 
real-time PCR(1) testing.
C. Causal agent: avian influenza virus strain H5N2. Pathogenicity details are 
pending. While DNA sequence analysis shows a string of multiple basic amino 
acids at the haemagglutinin cleavage site, which is consistent with one of the 
OIE definitions of high pathogenicity (see Manual of Standards for Diagnostic 
Tests and Vaccines, OIE, 2000), the inoculation studies in 4- to 8-week-old 
chickens have not resulted in any unusual mortality.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown at this time.
B. Other epidemiological details:
- Birds raised on the premises were being sold to supply the live bird 
markets in metropolitan areas (Houston).
- Poultry premises within a 16-km radius of the index case are being sampled 
and tested. To date, the premises tested within this radius are negative for 
avian influenza.
Control measures:
- stamping-out;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- surveillance.
(1) PCR: polymerase chain reaction
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: The USDA has confirmed 
that the H5N2 strain of avian influenza in a flock of chickens in Texas is 
highly pathogenic.

URGENT ACTION ALERT:
Support Letters from Needed for AB 1857, to Ban Declawing of Large Cats in 
California, Deadline for Support Letters: March 9

The California cat declaw bill has been amended and reintroduced as AB 
1857. This bill would now make it illegal for any person to declaw native 
or exotic wild cat species in the state of California (i.e. lions, tigers, 
cougars, leopards, lynxes, bobcats, cheetahs, jaguars, etc.). AB 1857 would 
still allow declawing of these cats for therapeutic purposes (i.e. 
legitimate medical needs). The bill would not apply to domestic cats. 
(Domestic cats were removed from the legislation due to strong opposition 
from some in the veterinary community, including the California Veterinary 
Medical Association.) AB 1857 is authored by California Assemblymember Paul 
Koretz.

CVMA has reportedly removed its opposition from the bill, given the new 
wording, but AB 1857 may still face opposition from segments of the 
entertainment industry which want to continue to declaw cats held in 
captivity for entertainment or viewing purposes. AB 1857 is scheduled to be 
heard by the Assembly Committee on Public Safety on Tuesday, March 16. 
Support letters, particularly those from California residents and animal 
organizations, should be sent to the Committee by Tuesday, March 9, to be 
listed in the bill analysis distributed at the hearing.

Please send a support letter by March 9 to the Public Safety Committee 
office. Letters should also be sent to the committee members. (Note: 
Assemblymember Paul Koretz also sits on this committee so support letters 
to his office can thank him for his leadership on this issue.) Below are 
some important points to emphasize in submitting your support letters. T

Uganda wants to sell endangered chimpanzees to China

A proposal by the Ugandan Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife 
and Antiquities to export three chimpazees to China's 
Zhouwang Zoo in Yunnan Province has raised concerns with 
environmental conservationists.

The proposal could lead to fears that Uganda's name as 
a protector of great apes could be tarnished with the 
consequent loss of tourism and donor funding.

A committee set up by the ministry last week met with 
officials of Uganda Wildlife Authority and endorsed the 
deal to export the chimps to China.

Nkiru Manya, executive director of Uganda Animal Protection 
Centre, defended the chimp export project but said animal 
rights activists should raise their concerns with the committee 
which is handling the export project.

If the export project proceeds as planned, the chimps 
will be exported to China in 20XX.

The Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife proposed 
Monday that Puget Sound's orcas be added to the state list of endangered species 
"because the marine mammals are at critically low levels and are vulnerable to 
several continuing threats."
The department made the recommendation based on a recent status report 
indicating that the population of "southern resident" killer whales in Puget Sound 
and nearby waters has declined 18 percent since 1995.
"The solid scientific work reflected in this report gives us an excellent 
base on which to assess the health of our resident orca population and determine 
what the next steps should be to protect one of the most enduring symbols of 
Puget Sound and the Pacific Northwest," said Jeff Koenings, the department's 
director.
The "southern residents" that swim in waters off Washington state and British 
Columbia include 84 orcas - down from a historical high of more than 120 in 
the 1960s, before the whales were captured in large numbers for display at 
marine parks.
The L pod, one of three groups of southern residents, has seen both higher 
mortality rates and lower birth rates, particularly in the past decade, 
according to the department's status report.
Scientists point to a decline in salmon, the orcas' main source of food, as 
well as accumulations of PCBs and other toxic chemicals in the water and stress 
from whale-watching boats and other vessels.
The Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission, a nine-member citizens panel 
that sets policy for the Department of Fish and Wildlife, is expected to take 
action on Monday's proposal at its April 1-3 meeting in Spokane.
A state listing would trigger a recovery plan that would guide efforts to 
protect the killer whales. Southern resident orcas are listed as "depleted" under 
the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which also requires a recovery plan 
for the species.
"The state's roles and responsibilities would complement, not replace, those 
of the federal agencies," Koenings said. "We want to operate from a clear 
understanding of the science so as to not duplicate the federal recovery plan."</docText>

DO you still eat chicken?? my mother-in-law asked last weekend.  
?Yes, but less,? I replied.  
?Better not to eat it,? father-in-law said.  
One week earlier, my mother had said: ?I went to the pasar malam to buy 
chicken but there?s none. Both chicken sellers didn?t turn up as there?s no 
business.?   
Such conversations are probably echoing throughout Malaysia, nay, across Asia 
where bird flu has made its presence felt, either directly or indirectly.  
Millions of chickens have been culled in 10 Asian countries, among them 
Thailand and Vietnam where the disease has claimed more than 20 lives. Most of the 
cases have been traced to direct contact with sick birds. Although there hasn?
t been any reported incidence of virus transmission during the preparation and 
consumption of chicken, people prefer to err on the side of caution.  
Everywhere politicians assure their people that chicken is safe for 
consumption by eating chicken publicly. Interested parties organise eat-chicken 
campaigns to spur demand for poultry. (When free chicken meals are offered, chicken 
phobia is forgotten and the meals would be snapped up faster than you can say, ?
Squawk!?)  
Our government has banned the import of poultry from Thailand and given the 
assurance that locally raised poultry is safe. That hasn't stopped the demand 
from declining, though. As a result, the price of poultry has gone down.   
Some hypermarkets have put up large signs proclaiming: ?Our poultry is 
locally produced.? (But their chicken is not fresh. I bought some chicken fillet and 
discovered that they stank after I removed the cling wrap at home. I cooked 
them for the dogs. The dogs are still alive.) </docText>

BIRDS of prey, including species such as the osprey and peregrine falcon, are on the increase in Scotland, according to figures obtained by The Scotsman. 
A report into the number of raptors, compiled by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), found numbers rising - despite 19th-century practices to eliminate predators from country estates still being "firmly entrenched amongst a proportion of Scotland's 21st-century land managers". 
The latest Bird of Prey Persecution Report for Scotland has found many raptors which were previously driven to national and regional extinction have made significant recoveries in recent years. Species have experienced population increases either through natural re-colonisation or concerted re-introduction programmes by humans. 
A total of 27 birds of prey were confirmed as being killed as a direct result of persecution in 2002, according to the study. 
Fifteen of the 27 raptors were poisoned, including seven buzzards, two golden eagles, two white-tailed eagles, one red kite, one sparrow-hawk and two peregrine falcons. In addition, two crows, three rooks, two magpies and 20 unidentified birds were found poisoned. 
The remaining 12 were killed as a result of what the RSPB terms "direct" persecution, meaning they were either shot, caught in cage or spring traps or died as a result of their nests being destroyed. Those killed by direct persecution included three peregrines, eight buzzards and one red kite. 
Many of those raptors killed were predominantly found in areas of game-rearing interest, the report shows. 
For red kites, the figures represent a massive reduction on the persecution figures for the previous year, in which there were an unprecedented ten confirmed cases of poisoning for the species. 
However, although the report shows a change in fortunes for the red kite, the apparent improvement is largely undermined by RSPB figures yet to be published for 2003. 
Although it will not report on last year's raptor persecution incidents until the beginning of 2005, the organisation already knows that ten red kites were killed last year. 
Also of particular note for 2002 was the killing of two white-tailed eagles. This equals all the known white-tailed eagle poisonings for the entire 25 year re-introduction programme since it began. The loss of breeding adults is the most damaging form of persecution that the long-lived, slow-breeding eagles can suffer. 
In order to prevent the continuation of raptor persecution, the RSPB report recommends that better enforcement of wildlife legislation and strengthening of the law to protect those species affected should remain a priority. 
It also calls on the Scottish Executive to fully implement the Nature Conservation Bill, which contains stronger measures to deal with wildlife crime in Scotland. 
Keith Morton, RSPB Scotland's investigations officer, said: "In some areas, a 19th-century attitude seems to still exist, whereby any predatory bird becomes a target. This is an outdated and deplorable attitude. We plan to assist the police with every criminal case we hear about and hope to see the tough new laws against this kind of activity used to the full to discourage it from happening any further." 
RSPB Scotland's Adam Harper added: "All birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981. As of last spring, wildlife was given even greater protection and wildlife criminals could now face prison. The Scottish Parliament is also currently looking at enhanced legislation with the Nature Conservation Bill." 
Commenting on the 2002 report, Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), said: "I really feel that since the SGA was set up the poisoning incidents have been reducing and have fallen every year."

        <docText>Concerned about political fallout from a
second black bear
hunt, the McGreevey administration is quietly urging
wildlife officials
to cancel this year's hunt, several people close to
the issue said. 
 
The hunt is viewed by the administration as a negative
for Gov. James E.
McGreevey at a time when he is eagerly courting
support for an ambitious
land preservation plan in the New Jersey Highlands,
where the state's
bear population is heavily concentrated, sources said.

 
The Highlands plan, which seeks to curtail development
in a vast,
forested region in the state's northwestern counties,
is seen as an
important legacy for McGreevey, while the six-day hunt
last December
drew mostly negative feedback. Much of the criticism
leveled at the
administration came from people who live in the
region. 
 
McGreevey acknowledged recently that he has received
more letters
protesting the hunt - the state's first in 33 years -
than any other
public policy issue, including property taxes. More
than 14,500 people
wrote to the governor urging him to cancel the hunt,
while a much
smaller number, about 2,800 writers, said they favored
it, a spokeswoman
said.

        <docText>A 25-year-old man suspected of poaching a trophy-size 
bighorn sheep posted a $50,000 bond Tuesday afternoon to get out of Garfield 
County Jail. 
Joshua Eli Lloyd, of Glenwood Springs, was arrested by Colorado Division of 
Wildlife officials in Glenwood Canyon around 10 p.m. Sunday after he allegedly 
tried to recover the partially-concealed head of his kill from a culvert north 
of Interstate 70, DOW area wildlife manager Pat Tucker said. 
Glenwood Canyon is a well-known habitat for the state?s official mammal, the 
bighorn sheep. 
?It was just a head cut off at the neck and stuffed in a plastic bag,? 
Tucker said on Tuesday. 
The head was discovered by a fisherman Sunday just north of Interstate 70 in 
the Grizzly Creek area. 
?They were out hiking and found it,? Tucker said. ?We found the rest of the 
body on the hill.?
Lloyd was arrested on three charges: a felony charge of willful destruction 
of wildlife; a charge of illegal possession of wildlife, which carries fines 
ranging from $1,000-$100,000; and a charge of violating Colorado?s Samson Law. 
Under the state?s Samson Law, illegal killing of trophy-size wildlife carries 
a $25,000 surcharge. Wildlife biologists said the ram Lloyd is suspected of 
killing was 81?2 years old, with a three-quarter horn curl. Any ram with a half 
curl ? where the horn has grown at least through half or 180 degrees of a 
circle ? meets the Samson classification, a DOW news release said. 
Lloyd is suspected of shooting the bighorn out of hunting season, without an 
appropriate license and in an area where bighorn hunting is never allowed.</docText>

        <docText>While the sky turned from nighttime black to 
pre-dawn blue and the wind cut through the pines and palmettos, the hunters 
unloaded their gear and the hounds paced in the covered bed of a pickup.
By the time the eastern clouds began to turn pink, the horses were saddled 
and the hunters were primping their tweeds and adjusting their Windsor knots. A 
radio played Irish fiddle music.
Far from the music, Loxahatchee, Fla., resident Maria Wise Miller rode across 
the pine flat woods alone. A length of string - its end soaked in fox urine - 
dragged behind her horse, laying a trail for the hounds and hunters to follow.
At 7:15 a.m., the master of the foxhounds blew his horn, the 18 riders 
gathered and the dogs poured out of the back of the truck, claws clicking on the 
metal tailgate, noses searching for the fox's scent.
The hunt was on.
Foxhunts, like this one hosted by the Palm Beach Hounds, are becoming 
increasingly popular in the United States and Canada, according to Dennis Foster, 
director of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America.
Over the past decade, the number of foxhunting clubs in the two countries has 
increased by more than 25 percent - from 140 to 177, he said.
Though foxhunting long has been under fire from animal rights activists in 
the United Kingdom, it has attracted much less attention in the United States. 
American hunters say their version of the sport is focused on the chase and 
doesn't usually involve killing foxes.</docText>

Dear Dog and Cat,                                                         

       When I say to move, it means to go someplace else, not switch 
positions with each other so there are still two of you in the way.                 

       The dishes with the paw print are yours and contain your food.  The 
other dishes are mine and contain my food.                                      

       Please note that placing a paw print in the middle of my plate and 
food does not stake a claim for it becoming your food and dish, nor do I find 
that aesthetically pleasing in the slightest.                             

       The stairway was not designed by NASCAR and is therefore not a 
racetrack.  Beating me to the bottom is not the object.  Tripping me doesn't help 
either, as I fall faster than you can run.                                

        I cannot buy anything bigger than a king size bed.  I am very sorry 
about this.  Do not think I will resort to sleeping on the sofa to ensure your 
comfort.  Look at videos of dogs and cats sleeping.  They can actually curl up 
into a ball.  It is not necessary to sleep perpendicular to each other 
stretched out to the fullest extent possible.                       

       Please note that sticking tails and tongues out to maximize space used 
is nothing but sarcasm.                                                      

       My compact discs are not miniature frisbees.                           
   

      For the last time, there is not a secret exit from the bathroom.  If, 
by some miracle, I beat you there and manage to get the door shut, it is not 
necessary to claw, whine, try to turn the knob, or get your paw under the edge 
and try to pull the door open.                                       

      When I exit this room, I will come out the same door I entered.  In 
addition, I have been using bathrooms for years.  Canine and/or feline attendance 
has never been necessary.

Every once in a while officers here at Animal Care and Control run into 
really sad situations. Last week, they were called to a residence to assist with 
about 35 cats that lived in a home with a lady who had to go to the hospital. 
The condition of the cats and the home were typical of an animal hoarder, a 
person who "collects" animals WAY past his or her ability to care for them. 
This home was filthy and full of cat feces and trash. The cats were thin, some 
had genetic deformities, many were deaf and had large areas of patchy or missing 
fur. 
So, thinking about this disorder, the boss went to the Tufts University Web 
site which has lots of enlightening and sobering information. They used the 
following criteria to define animal hoarding: "More than the typical number of 
companion animals. Inability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, 
sanitation, shelter, and veterinary care, with this neglect often resulting in 
starvation, illness, and death. Denial of the inability to provide this minimum 
care and the impact of that failure on the animals, the household, and human 
occupants of the dwelling." 
These cases most often come to light when the "crazy lady with all the cats" 
down the street is brought to the attention of authorities by a neighbor, 
family member or health care professional. Sometimes utility workers who notice a 
foul smell from a residence or garage will contact the police and the truth of 
what is occurring at the residence comes out. 
The homes are often unlivable to anyone but the individual who resides there. 
Many of the homes of these people must be condemned once the enforcement case 
has come to an end because the interior of the home is so damaged by animal 
waste and filth it cannot be reclaimed. Animal control officers who have to 
enter the home often have to wear masks or self-contained breathing devices for 
their own protection.</docText>

DELANO -- Record numbers of ducks, ibises, egrets and other waterfowl are 
wintering in a wildlife refuge in the southern San Joaquin Valley, thriving in 
restored wetlands that have been fully flooded for the first time since creation 
of the refuge four decades ago.

Covering the Kern National Wildlife Refuge's 6,500 acres of wetlands in water 
after decades of only having enough resources to water a third of the area 
has turned the marsh into "an oasis in the desert," said Ducks Unlimited 
biologist Chris Hildebrandt.

A federal act passed in 1992 and gradually implemented over the last decade 
has mandated that Central Valley refuges receive a reliable supply of water. To 
the wildlife at Kern -- a wetlands refuge created without its own water 
supply in the middle of thirsty grape and cotton farms -- the Central Valley 
Project Improvement Act has made all the difference.

Thick green tufts of bulrushes, wild millet and other native grasses dot the 
lush marshland, providing food and shelter for familiar birds like mallard 
ducks, the little white-billed black coots and the common moorehen, but also 
attracting more than 6,000 white-faced ibises, a bird hardly seen in the Central 
Valley 10 years ago, and birds that are rare in the area, like tri-colored 
blackbirds. Clusters of cottonwood trees are weighed down by dozens of great blue 
herons in their nests. The majestic bird lives on the frogs and fish it 
catches in the surrounding marsh.

"If you worked at it, you could spot 150 species out here in a day," said 
refuge manager David Hardt.</docText>

The Garage Sale/Raffle Fund-raiser to benefit the Ashland County Humane 
Society is March 27 from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 342 College Avenue. 
Adoption info 
To learn more about adopting a pet from the Ashland County Humane Society, 
volunteering or making a donation,
The site also offers more information about Hope, an injured and pregnant 
black Labrador retriever mix, who is looking for a home. If you would like to 
help the humane society offset the costs of Hope's medical bills, the 
organization is accepting donations at any National City Bank or at the society. 
All of the society's cats are feline leukemia tested, have received 
vaccinations and are spayed or neutered before being placed for adoption. Dogs in the 
Tender Loving Dog Care Program also receive vaccinations and are spayed or 
neutered. If you would like to adopt a dog through this program, call (419) 
525-4455. 


Despite not having a home of its own, the Ashland County Humane Society is 
still determined to give homeless, injured pets a chance to survive -- even if 
they have to be creative. 
Take the case of Hope, a very pregnant, very injured chocolate lab, who found 
her way to the humane society last week. Even though the humane society does 
not have a building to put her in, one of the board's members, Laura Bailey, 
found a spot in her home for the risky pregnancy to take place after treatment 
at a local veterinarian. 
Though the group has been without a building for about three years, the 
humane society has grown and developed, and its love for animals has not 
diminished. </docText>

BEIJING For all the hoopla about China's booming economy, its manufacturing 
muscle and its potential to become a great power, the world's most populous 
country is struggling to keep the lights on. And the sporadic blackouts that 
plagued much of China last year are raising complicated questions for the 
Communist Party and for the rest of the world: 
.
How and where will China get the energy it needs to maintain its economic 
growth? And how much will the environment suffer for it? 
.
"It's one of the hottest issues facing the international energy industry," 
said Scott Roberts, chief representative in the Beijing office of Cambridge 
Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Massachusetts. "The growth 
has been explosive, and I think it has caught many people in China and 
elsewhere off guard." 
.
China's emergence has already roiled commodities markets as the country has 
become a voracious consumer of energy and raw materials. 
.
Last year, its oil imports rose nearly one-third. It also built so many new 
cars, factories, airports and high-rise buildings that it passed the United 
States to become the world's biggest steel importer, according to the Iron and 
Steel Statistics Bureau, a British-based information clearinghouse for the steel 
industry. 
.
Electricity consumption jumped by 15 percent. Domestic coal production rose 
by 100 million tons - and still there were shortages. 
.
Yet China's appetite today is modest compared with what is estimated for the 
future; the country's energy needs are expected to more than double by 2020. 
This prospect has the Communist Party reportedly rolling out plans for at least 
100 new power plants, including nuclear, hydropower and coal-fired ones. It 
has also raised concerns that efforts to improve China's polluted environment 
will be muted by the demand for power. 
.
Plans call for at least 20 nuclear plants to be built by 2020. Hydropower 
projects, regarded by many Chinese officials as a clean power source, are 
threatening to disrupt the ecological balance along many important rivers that flow 
out of the high Tibetan plateau. 
.
Accounting for almost 70 percent of China's power supply, coal is a primary 
source of greenhouse gases, and experts say that by 2020 China could pass the 
United States as the world's biggest source of carbon monoxide. The fact that 
this is happening is perhaps not surprising because America is an economic, if 
not a political, model for China. 
.
"The fundamental problem is that China is following the path of the United 
States, and probably the world cannot afford a second United States," said Zhang 
Jianyu, program manager for the Beijing office of Environmental Defense, a 
U.S.-based advocacy group. 
.
In an address this month before the annual meeting of the National People's 
Congress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao captured the competing pressures of the 
economy when he cited environmental protection and called for building a 
"conservation-minded society" while also exhorting the country to develop more energy 
sources. 
.
"We must speed up the development of large coal mines, important 
power-generating facilities and power grids, the exploration and exploitation of petroleum 
and other important resources," he said. 
.
Zhang said China's environmental degradation was already being measured in 
economic losses. He said state officials estimated that acid rain caused about 
$13 billion in damage annually, while air pollution reduces the annual gross 
domestic product by about 3 percent. 
.
China is also often inefficient in its energy use. Roberts, the Cambridge 
Energy consultant, said that the worst Chinese industries wasted 70 percent more 
energy than their counterparts in the United States. He also noted that 
China's electricity consumption grew 15 percent last year and 10.4 percent in 2002 - 
a spike in demand that he said was equal to the total power consumption of 
Brazil. "They are adding a middle-sized country every two years in terms of 
energy consumption," he said. 
.
This helps explain why energy security is an increasingly important issue for 
Chinese leaders, particularly regarding oil. China began importing oil in the 
early 1990s, partly because its own supplies were leveling out but also 
because of rising demand. Now the U.S. invasion of Iraq has shown a nation 
dependent on Middle East oil how vulnerable it could become. 
.
An analysis of China's energy situation made in December by Deutsche Bank 
said that in response to the Iraq war, China had begun building storage 
facilities to create a strategic oil reserve. The report also said the country was 
aggressively pursuing oil deals around the world, from neighboring Kazakhstan and 
Russia to fields as far away as South America and Canada. 
.
For now, power officials are warning that another spate of blackouts is 
likely. Last year, nearly two-thirds of the provinces and autonomous regions of 
China experienced varying degrees of blackouts. This year, officials say, could 
be as bad or maybe worse.

Sportsmen are flexing their political muscle around the country, changing 
laws in state after state to protect against what they see as threats to 
their heritage.

In Pennsylvania, for example -- second to Texas in total licensed hunters -- 
sportsmen have hardly been under siege. Yet even there, the state 
Constitution could soon carry a new guarantee:

"Right of the people to hunt and fish."

Exactly what that would mean is unclear. But the broader trend is quite 
clear: Eleven states recognize citizens' right to hunt, fish or trap, mostly 
through laws or constitutional changes approved in the last few years.

Six have begun the amendment process, the National Conference of State 
Legislatures said. No one is even tracking legislation that has not yet come 
up for a vote.

Many of the changes are attempts to enshrine in law control over practices 
that sportsmen consider part of their tradition and that animal-rights 
forces say are immoral.</docText>

Can you imagine hooking your dog up to a sled with 15 other dogs, and
running them in four- to five-hour stretches for 9-14 continuous days in
an 1,150-mile race? That would be the approximate distance between
Asheville, N.C., and Bangor, Maine. Under the best of circumstances this
would be grueling, but add to the mix sub-zero temperatures, arctic winds,
snowstorms and ice. This is the Iditarod.

Most of us would consider such brutal treatment to be animal cruelty
punishable by law, but the Iditarod is Alaska's biggest "sporting event,"
and is supported by major corporations. Organizers discount the 120
recorded dog deaths as just a tiny fraction of the animals that run. The
"I-Killed-A-Dog" race has a death rate of 2.9 fatalities for every 1,000
competitors, which is the mathematical equivalent of 290 deaths in the
Boston Marathon during the last decade. Susan Butcher, a four-time winner
of the Iditarod, has publicly stated, "We {dog mushers) wouldn't as a
group, pass anybody's idea of humane treatment of animals."
...
As Jon Saraceno, sports writer for USA Today stated, "It is the most
immoral, reprehensible 'sporting event' in the USA." Other sports writers
have had equally disparaging remarks about the Iditarod. You can help to
end this brutal race by writing to the sponsors. Go to
www.helpsleddogs.org for contact information. Major corporations have
dropped their sponsorships of the race after hearing from the public about
the brutal treatment of the dogs.

Turlock?s animal shelter has been posting stellar adoption rates for its 
furry wards, saving more than 500 animals through a concerted, active campaign by 
dedicated staff members.

The shelter is looking into upgrading its current facility with a new 
16-kennel building and an office and procedure building complete with a lounge area 
where people would be allowed play with any animals they may be considering for 
adoption.

The Turlock Animal Shelter saved 538 dogs from being euthanized in 2003, just 
more than half of the 1,041 canines that have seen the inside of the tiny 
building?s walls.

?We are very active in trying to find homes for the animals in our care,? 
said Senior Animal Control Officer Glena Jackson. ?We have a web site where we 
post the images of our animals, updated every 24 hours, we actively check for 
vacancies at no-kill shelters and of course have the pet page in the paper.?

Even for all of that effort, there are some animals which just cannot be 
saved, particularly wild cats.

?Sixty percent of the cats we get are feral,? said Jackson. ?We do our best 
to find homes for what animals we can, but there are just some animals which 
are not fit for adoption.?

In addition, the race to adoption is made more difficult by the cramped 
facilities the shelter currently occupies.

?We have had to put up to three dogs in these kennels,? Jackson said. ?
Kennels ... are meant for one animal.?</docText>

Even groups which are not terrorists, but are opposed to the policies of
the U.S. government, are often branded "terrorist" in order to demonize
them and justify their persecution. FBI surveillance of demonstrators
against the Iraq war was justified through scare stories about "terrorist
infiltrators." The Earth Liberation Front has been labeled terrorist, even
though it hasn't killed, or attempted to kill, a single person. In Iraq,
many suicide bombs and attacks against military targets have been
described as "terrorism." Terrorism is the targeting and killing of
civilians, suicide bombings or other attacks against military targets are
not terrorism. If attacking military targets is also terrorism then
virtually all military action, virtually all violence, would be terrorism
- a definition so broad that the term becomes meaningless. The Earth
Liberation Front engages in property destruction designed to reduce
pollution and save the Earth. Regardless of the ethics of these actions,
it is not terrorism because they do not attempt to kill civilians. If
violating property rights were terrorism then the Underground Railroad
(which violated property rights) would be an example of terrorism. If the
American revolution had happened today George Washington would be branded
a domestic terrorist by the British.


This fake ?war on terrorism? is a highly-effective propaganda device used
by Bush and others to ram through their authoritarian agenda. Dissent has
been demonized as "unpatriotic" and ?anti-American.? Anything the
government doesn't like gets labeled "terrorist" or "supporting
terrorism." The "war" is used as an excuse to justify any kind of military
intervention, as in Iraq, simply by accusing the enemy of "supporting
terrorism." Opposing free trade has even been equated with supporting
terrorism. In the name of the "war on terrorism" civil liberties have been
drastically decreased through a number of measures. The PATRIOT Act,
passed by congress with virtually no debate, gives the FBI the power to
access your private medical, library, financial and student records
without a warrant and to forbid anyone from telling you that they have
accessed them. It allows non-citizens to be jailed on mere suspicion, not
actual evidence, and be denied re-admission to the United States if they
have opinions the U.S. government does not like. People convicted of no
crime may be held indefinitely without any meaningful judicial review. In
addition to the PATRIOT act, secret military tribunals have been set up to
try alleged "terrorists" without the right to a fair trial. Thousands of
immigrants were "disappeared." New attorney general guidelines allow
spying on dissident organizations without any evidence of illegal activity.</docText>

?They were first introduced to England near Cheshire,? explains Zoe Smolka, 
Scotland?s first red squirrel conservation officer, with the Dumfries-based 
Red Squirrels in South Scotland. ?At the time, a lot of plants were being 
introduced to decorate gardens, and stately home owners seemed to think squirrels 
would make a nice addition. No-one anticipated how successful they would be, or 
the serious consequences of their spread on the red squirrel population.? 
Numerically, the greys undoubtedly have it. Their population is estimated at 
more than two million against only around 160,000 reds. Why can?t they live 
together? The problem, apparently, is that while both eat similar diets, greys 
hold the evolutionary advantage, being capable of digesting large seeds from 
broadleaved trees. Reds, meanwhile, are heavily dependent on traditional Scots 
spruce trees ? which are currently in decline. What?s more the larger greys 
eat more and can digest unripe acorns and seeds. Reds ? which have to wait till 
fruits ripen ? are being pipped to their food supply, resulting in weight loss 
and inability to breed. The ?grey tide? is considered a major threat to reds?
 survival, which is why SNH?s strategy ? as well as targeting land 
management, including plantations that favour reds over grey ? also prioritises control 
of the invader, whose status is that of vermin. 
It gets thornier; ?control? translates as ?culling?. Live capture and 
shooting are the only legal methods of dispatching the creatures, and Smolka ? the 
red squirrels? champion in south Scotland ? demonstrates a typical wire cage 
trap. Baited with maize ? a favourite grey squirrel snack ? they are covered 
and placed on the ground, where greys generally feed. To minimise suffering, 
traps are checked twice daily, and any reds immediately released. As for the 
unfortunate greys, Smolka says: ?Some people shoot them in the trap, but we 
advise you get a sack, put it over the end and when the trap is open, the grey 
goes into the sack. You then take it in the sack to very solid ground, like 
concrete or stone, and give it a very hard blow to the back of the head.? </docText>

On Saturday, May 8th, the day before Mothers Day, there will be pet 
store demonstrations held throughout the State of Florida, in a 
massive effort to educate the public about puppymills.  We are 
notifying as many rescue groups and shelters as we possibly can, 
and asking if you all could possibly help the cause by arranging for 
demonstrations in your area or to attend a demonstration that has 
been arranged.  We had a fairly good turnout for the two recent 
demonstrations that were held down here.  Many of those that attended 
were either from rescue groups/shelters or had a horrifying 
experience with pet store puppymill puppies.  As you are probably 
well aware, new pet stores are opening up all over.   Here in Broward 
County, the numbers are unbelievable.  We know that there are many 
others throughout the state that feel as we do about pet stores and 
puppymills.

If we could some how pull this off, this could be the most eye 
opening event ever in Florida. But we can't do it without your help.  
You would have to contact your local police, city hall or code 
enforcement, to find out if a permit or letter of authorization is 
needed.  More than likely something is required.  They will probably 
want at least 1 weeks notice, but it would be better to check with 
them.  They will or should give you the do's and dont's as well.  
Some cities do not allow signs on sticks (no sticks) or bullhorns.  You 
certainly want to inform them that this is going to be a peaceful 
demonstration.  

It is important that we have an idea as to how many people are 
participating, and which part of the state they are in, so that we 
know which areas will be covered.  We are planning to contact the 
media here in south Florida and encourage you to do the same for 
your area.  We will attempt to also have it reported/announced on 
national news, providing we know which areas are demonstrating.   Can 
we count on you and your rescue organization, friends, neighbors and 
family?

Founder of Animal Hunting Ranch visits Shravaana

Following meetings with officials from the US Department 
of Agriculture, the founder and CEO of international 
import/export firm Global Ways (not a publicly traded 
entity), Mr. Madhi Kim, visited the local exotic animal 
sanctuary 35 miles north east of San Diego.

The sanctuary, dubbed Shravaana, is a private animal 
sanctuary run by the megastar Rapper r'Bear, winner of 
two Grammy awards.  Singer r'Bear, established the exotic 
animal ranch two years ago in an effort to help repopulate 
the world's endangered species.

The two exotic animal ranchers spent the day touring the 
5600 acre ranch.  Mr. Kim, a former game warden from 
Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve, also owns an animal 
ranch. The Texas ranch, Wild Things, provides exotic 
animals for big game hunters willing to pay thousands of 
dollars for the chance to bag a wildebeest or a scimitar-
horned oryx.

The tour included the now-completed lake, which is home 
to a flock of Trumpeter Swans and several species of endangered 
fish, including the Alabama Shad and the Clanwilliam Redfin.

We all know couples who fight like cats and dogs. Increasingly, there are 
couples who fight over cats and dogs. For custody.
In one such case handled by Montreal lawyer Helen Sanders, each of the 
spouses in a divorcing couple was seeking sole custody of their two young children. 
Both also wanted the dog.
"My instinct was that the dog was not wanted by the parties out of 
sentimental considerations for the dog, per se," observed Sanders, a partner in the firm 
of O'Hanlon, Sanders, Cheng. "In this heated litigation, the parties 
considered that if they got the dog, they would get the children, as the children were 
so attached to the dog."
Ultimately, the parties agreed the dog would go where the children went. When 
they settled on joint custody - for the children and the dog - it probably 
made the transition between the two homes easier, Sanders noted in an e-mail.
In another file, a couple was having a tough time separating amicably. They 
were arguing over their property, which included their dogs. "The problem was 
that both my client and her ex-boyfriend had come into the relationship with a 
dog each. And these were big dogs."
The dogs had grown close. At the heart of the dispute, Sanders explained, was 
whether each dog would return to his original owner or whether the owners 
could share them.
Her client wanted joint custody, "as she didn't want the dogs to pine for 
each other." The ex-boyfriend wanted a clean break. Ultimately, they came to a 
detailed agreement that provided for joint custody on a three-month trial basis, 
with a proviso that if it didn't work, both dogs would go and live with the 
ex-girlfriend. If she, in turn, couldn't handle the two dogs, she would 
"transfer custody" of both to her ex-boyfriend.
Fortunately, Sanders recalled, there was "a very nice and canine-friendly 
lawyer on the opposite side who took the concerns of the clients seriously."</docText>

These days, you can be a volunteer friend of just about anything. You can be 
a Friend of the Environment, of the Earth, or of a library. Thousands of 
volunteer groups around the world work tirelessly to improve their communities. In 
times of a lagging economy and budget cuts, volunteers are needed perhaps more 
than ever to help maintain our environment.
Why do people volunteer for environmental causes? Besides improving the 
environment, volunteering is an excellent learning experience. As we become 
educated in a new area, we may be better able to go forth and educate others. 
Education and communication across work, social, and academic borders is increasingly 
important today.
One important example of volunteer support is in the National Wildlife Refuge 
System. With every funding dollar stretched to the breaking point, more and 
more refuges and their barebones staffs rely on volunteers and "Friends of" 
groups to help preserve these precious patches of the Earth. Started by Teddy 
Roosevelt in 1903, the refuge system now has 542 wildlife refuges across the 
United States. Today, 240 refuge "friends" groups with a combined 30,000 to 40,000 
volunteers give their time to support refuges. The National Wildlife Refuge 
System is critically dependent on the lasting commitment and untiring effort of 
the thousands of people each year who volunteer their precious time to work 
on refuges around the country. They come from all walks of life and bring a 
wide diversity of talents and experience to the task.... biologists, birders, 
educators, artists, photographers, carpenters, plumbers, mechanics secretaries, 
architects, planners, and many, many more. Sometimes they contribute from a 
distance, donating photographs, doing library research, drafting text and art for 
brochures, etc. More often you'll find them when you visit refuges, as they 
are clearing walking trails, cleaning up trash, rebuilding facilities, 
operating big equipment, gathering water samples or restoring habitat. One Friends 
group president offered her reasons for volunteering: "I'm a doer and a fixer and 
I love community development." It can be just that simple to start getting 
involved and making a difference.</docText>

A nutrition student says her rights were trampled on after being 
forced to work with animal products in one of her classroom 
experiments or fail her assignment, despite her personal beliefs.
Tanya Kowalenko, a second-year student and a vegan, said she was 
ordered to attend a biochemistry lab on Feb. 20 or fail. She said in 
the lab, her professor instructed the class to dab egg yolk on a 
piece of test paper. The test was to determine the amount of lipid 
gels in eggs.
Kowalenko said she e-mailed her professor, Mario Estable, about a 
week-and-a-half prior to the lab, voicing her concerns. She said she 
was willing to do another assignment in lieu of working with animal 
products, but her professor said it wasn't a valid excuse.
"Part of the lab I wasn't really comfortable doing because there were 
animal products used in the lab, so I sent an e-mail and he wrote 
back that it wasn't a valid reason. I had to go to the lab," she said.
According to an e-mail from Kowalenko, Estable 
replied, "Unfortunately I am unable to accommodate your request for 
exemption from labs using animal products. If you miss the 
laboratories without a valid reason, you will consequently receive a 
zero for those laboratories missed.
"Adhering to a vegan diet is not considered a valid reason for 
missing the laboratories," he wrote.
Estable refused to comment on the situation.
Kowalenko has been a vegan for the last two years and does not 
believe in using any animal products or products that harm animals.
Chris Evans, interim chair for the department of chemistry and 
biology, said there are no rules governing this 
type of situation.
"As far as I know, in Ryerson's policy there are no policies covering 
vegan or moral policies, but we try to accommodate academic needs," 
Evans said.
"Usually these kinds of problems can be resolved by the student and 
professor."
Evans said he hasn't spoken with Estable but says that this 
particular lab was a partnered endeavour and Kowalenko could have 
asked her partner to work with the egg yolk.
Kowalenko admits she didn't touch the egg yolk, but feels wronged for 
being forced to work with animal products.
This is not the first time Kowalenko has had a conflict between her 
personal beliefs and Ryerson's curriculum requirements. Last year, 
she took two courses food service management and nutrition in 
which she was expected to work with animal products. But she says she 
was exempted from class work with no problems from her professors and 
did alternative assignments to earn her marks.
Kowalenko hopes that by coming forward with her story, she can 
emphasize that a person's beliefs don't have to be compromised under 
any circumstances.
"(I want to) get them to understand that people have different 
morals ... I was pretty upset that I had to do it."

When, in October 1957, the USSR launched the first man-made earth satellite, the basketball-sized Sputnik, it caught the United States off guard and sent the government into fits. Not only had the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb years before the Americans predicted they would, but now they were leading the "space race." In response, the Defense Department approved funding for a new U.S. satellite project, headed by former Nazi SS officer Wernher von Braun, and created, in 1958, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to make certain that the United States forever after maintained "a lead in applying state-of-the-art technology for military capabilities and to prevent technological surprise from her adversaries." 

Almost half a century later, what's left of the USSR is a collapsed group of half-failed states, while the U.S. stands alone as the globe's sole hyperpower. Yet DARPA, the agency for an arms-race world, seems only to be warming up to the chase. There may be no country left to take the lead from us, the nearest military competitor being China which reportedly had $65 billion in military expenditures in 2002 (compared to our $466 billion according to GlobalSecurity.org) and which, only in 2003, put its first "Taikonaut" into outer space. Undaunted, DARPA continues to develop high-tech weapons systems for 2025-2050 and beyond - some of them standard fare like your run-of-the-mill. hypersonic bombers, others more exotic. 

In an August 2003 article, Los Angeles Times reporter Charles Pillar noted that DARPA has put forth some of the "most boneheaded ideas ever to spring from the government" -- including a "mechanical elephant" that never made it into the jungles of Vietnam and telepathy research that never quite afforded the U.S. the ability to engage in psychic spying. 

As former DARPA Director Charles Herzfeld noted in 1975, "When we fail, we fail big." Little has changed. According to DARPA's current chief, some 85%-90% of its projects fail to meet their full objectives. Still, Piller points out, DARPA "has been behind some of the world's most revolutionary inventions" - "the Internet, the global positioning system, stealth technology and the computer mouse."

Professional fund-raisers apparently still love Indiana, despite a tough 
state do-not-call list that now includes nearly 60 percent of Indiana's 
residential phone lines. 

Indiana's no-call law covers business solicitations and calls from charities 
that use professional telemarketers, but exempts charities that use their own 
volunteers and/or employees. 

One of the toughest do-not-call laws in the United States, the list 
administered by the Indiana attorney general went into effect Jan. 1, 2002. 

Since then, the attorney general's office has logged more than 6,000 
complaints about violations of the law from consumers. It has reached voluntary 
compliance agreements with 139 companies accused of violating the rule. Of those, 
124 also paid fines that, so far, total $351,000. 

Professional fund-raisers also are required to register their Indiana 
telemarketing campaigns with the state. Two years ago, when Attorney General Steve 
Carter first published the list on his Web site, 
www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/consumer/charityfundraisers.htm, it contained 350 active campaigns. 

The newest list, effective Jan. 1, contains 331 active campaigns -- very 
nearly the same number. (see chart, Pages 8-9B) 

"Right now, it just narrows down who they can call," said Summer Burgin, a 
spokeswoman for Carter's office. 

Professional telemarketers still have a million Hoosier residential lines 
they legitimately can call, as well as business phone numbers, which are not part 
of the no-call program. 

And those calls can be quite lucrative for the telemarketing firms. Fifty of 
the current Indiana campaigns guarantee just 1 percent to the charity, with 
the professional fund-raiser claiming the remainder. 

That's actually better than the 2002 list, on which 100 campaigns promised 
just 1 percent to the charity. 

Although state law says the donations split should represent a good faith 
estimate of the final breakdown, "some choose to go to the end of the spectrum," 
Burgin said. That's because some professional fund-raisers who register 
campaigns with the state don't want to be held to a higher number should costs 
exceed their expectations. 

One current campaign, conducted by professional telemarketer Telefund Inc. on 
behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights 
organization, lists a negative 8 percent share to the nonprofit. 

In other words, Telefund keeps 100 percent of what it raises and PETA pays 
them an additional 8 percent on top of that. </docText>

Global anti-whaling campaign launched 
- newly released report exposes the cruelty behind whaling - 
A new report, 'Troubled Waters', is being released today to mark the launch 
of a global campaign against whaling. Key scientific and practical evidence is 
brought together for the first time to highlight the true extent of the 
cruelty inherent in the modern day killing of whales. More than 1,400 whales are 
expected to die this year alone. 
The Royal New Zealand SPCA is part of an unprecedented coalition of over 140 
non-governmental organisations in more than 55 countries, led by the World 
Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA). The coalition's 'Whalewatch' 
campaign is lobbying the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to call a halt to 
all commercial and scientific whaling operations, maintain the current ban on 
commercial whaling and bring the issue of cruelty back to the fore. 
Peter Blomkamp, Chief Executive of the Royal New Zealand SPCA, said, "The 
cruelty behind whaling has become obscured in recent years by abstract arguments 
over population statistics. The fact is that, whether it is one whale or a 
thousand, whaling is simply wrong on cruelty grounds alone." 
Although commercial whaling has been banned since 1986, over 20,000 whales 
have been killed since the ban came into force. The technology used for killing 
whales has altered little since the 19th century, when the grenade tipped 
harpoon was invented. In the constantly moving environment in which whales live 
and are hunted, there are inherent difficulties in achieving a quick clean kill. 
Despite its destructive power, the harpoon often fails to kill outright and 
some whales take over an hour to die.</docText>

In a move worthy of Orwell's Big Brother, the Washington state legislature 
is being asked to fund a law enforcement database of "eco-terrorists" that 
would, in fact, track citizens engaged in lawful environmental advocacy, 
such as signing a petition to save old-growth forests, attending a rally 
for clean air, or simply joining a group like the Sierra Club or Defenders 
of Wildlife.

There is still time to stop this draconian and unconstitutional measure, 
but we need to act today! Contact your state representative and urge him or 
her to vote against any attempt to fund the Animal and Ecological Terrorism 
Act such as the current Senate Budget Bill (SB 6187), presently before the 
House Rules Committee.

The AETA invokes the language of terrorism to restrict our hard- won 
constitutional rights of free assembly and free speech.  It defines "animal 
rights or ecological terrorist organization" as "two or more persons 
organized for the purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity 
intended to obstruct or deter any persons from participating in an activity 
involving animals or... natural resources."

This dangerously broad definition of "terrorist" would catch anybody who's 
ever sent in $10 to save the pandas. It's a thinly disguised effort to 
quash environmental activism and intimidate citizens who want to speak out. 
  The sponsors of this legislation have certainly learned from Attorney 
General Ashcroft's repeated use of terrorism fears to justify the sacrifice 
of Americans' rights and liberties.

We need your help to show that even in times of elevated security concerns, 
Americans aren't willing to give up their most cherished freedoms. Contact 
your state representative TODAY and urge him or her to vote against any 
attempt to fund the Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act such as the current 
Senate Budget Bill SB 6187).

The question is as simple as this: do you want a few corporations to 
monopolise the global food supply? If the answer is yes, you should welcome the 
announcement that the government is expected to make today that the commercial 
planting of a genetically modified (GM) crop in Britain can go ahead. If the answer 
is no, you should regret it. The principal promotional effort of the genetic 
engineering industry is to distract us from this question. 
GM technology permits companies to ensure that everything we eat is owned by 
them. They can patent the seeds and the processes that give rise to them. They 
can make sure that crops can't be grown without their patented chemicals. 
They can prevent seeds from reproducing themselves. By buying up competing seed 
companies and closing them down, they can capture the food market, the biggest 
and most diverse market of all. 
No one in her right mind would welcome this, so the corporations must 
persuade us to focus on something else. At first they talked of enhancing consumer 
choice, but when the carrot failed, they switched to the stick. Now we are told 
that unless we support the deployment of GM crops in Britain, our science base 
will collapse. And that, by refusing to eat GM products in Europe, we are 
threatening the developing world with starvation. Both arguments are, shall we 
say, imaginative; but in public relations, cogency counts for little. All that 
matters is that you spin the discussion out for long enough to achieve the 
necessary result. And that means recruiting eminent figures to make the case on 
your behalf.</docText>

        <docText>For two months, guards and medical staff at
a California state prison failed to provide meals or emergency care to an
imprisoned Sikh priest from India, Khem Singh, dying of malnutrition,
according to inmate accounts given to a state senator.

In the days before 72-year-old Singh ? who spoke no English and was
crippled ? starved to death at the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility in
Corcoran last month, inmates said, they alerted correctional officers to
his condition and filed complaints. But no medical help was provided.
While some accounts said Singh was on a hunger strike, others insisted he
wanted vegetarian meals but was consistently served meat. 
...
In the days after Singh?s death, corrections officials in Sacramento said
he had been depressed since arriving at the prison in 2001, protesting
against his molestation conviction and refusing to eat a diet that didn?t
conform to his vegetarian practices. The official account was that he died
after a series of ??on and off again?? hunger strikes. But the California
prison system has a detailed policy on handling such strikes: guards must
document refusal of meals, determine the reason for it and report it to a
supervisor; nurses and doctors must visit the inmate daily and assess his
weight, and if the inmate?s condition worsens, the prison could force-feed
fluids and nutrients.

None of this was done for Singh, corrections officials admit. But now they
say that Singh hadn?t officially declared a hunger strike. ??He was
refusing meals sporadically, but it wasn?t a hunger strike,?? said Kelley
Santoro, the prison?s public information officer. ??Was he eating
sporadically because he was a vegetarian and didn?t like the food served
to him? Was he being monitored? All that is under investigation.?? 
...
Inmates said he would pray and bow to them and guards, but would grow
frustrated when prison staff insisted on serving meat. He would often eat
just a piece of bread with peanut butter. ??One inmate told us this whole
thing is about vegetables. ?If they would have just given him vegetables
instead of meat, he would be alive today?,?? Romero said. ??But every time
he was in line, they insisted on slopping down the meat?.??</docText>

It's almost inevitable. In even the most carefully chosen food plan, there
comes that time when your diet is no longer working. Either the weight is
returning or you're just plain bored because you find yourself eating the
same foods day after day. Every diet has inherent pitfalls. If you're in a
rut, the first thing you need to do is identify the obstacle and then find
your way around it. Here are some ways to successfully navigate the
landmines of the most popular weight-management methods:
...
Vegetarian

Physicians, nutritionists and every food study ever done recommend a diet
high in fruits and vegetables. The vegetarian is one of the few who meets
or exceeds these recommendations, and is the darling of the diet world.
What could possibly be wrong?

Advantages: A plethora of healthful, low-calorie foods is available. If
the emphasis is on fruits and vegetables, you can nearly eat your fill
without worrying about calories, Richter said. The diet is also steeped in
vitamins and nutrients.

Pitfalls: Animal protein contains its share of vital nutrients, including
vitamin B-12 and beta carotene, Thompson said. And since cupcakes fit a
vegetarian diet as well as carrots, some people think a dinner of broccoli
and soy allows them to splurge on cheesecake and milkshakes (or, if their
diet prohibits dairy products, fries and onion rings). A strict vegetarian
diet can also be strictly boring.

The fix: Be creative to eliminate the boredom. There are dozens of
vegetarian cookbooks filled with meals and desserts that challenge the
taste buds, Thompson said. Add legumes for protein and avoid overloading
on carbohydrates by eating whole grains, Richter said.

Colin Lowry, cell biologist and Associate Editor of 21st Century Science &amp;
Technology magazine, was interviewed on Feb. 12 on the danger of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?BSE, or mad cow disease?and the little-known
science of prions. The interview, excerpted here, was conducted by
Economics Editor Marcia Merry Baker and Science Editor Marjorie Mazel
Hecht. The full interview will appear in 21st Century Science and Technology.

EIR: We have had two cases of BSE in North America over the past nine
months, and from a scientific point of view, you have said that the
Federal food and agriculture safety policy is outrageous. What is the danger?

Lowry: The Federal standards are totally inadequate. There's very little
testing at all to identify cows that are slaughtered that might have BSE.
There is absolutely no testing before an animal is slaughtered, which is a
real problem, because if you find a BSE cow, you can't identify where it
came from. And the only way to find new cases is to catch them at
slaughter by chance.
...
EIR: And then you also had big funding of the effort of the so-called
friends-of-the-animals, to say, that prion disease is "revenge" on
meat-eaters.... In Britain, they just cancelled the building of a new
research lab, because of the animal rights people protesting, that they
didn't want testing on animals. And yet, who is going to get hurt from this?

Lowry: The first casualty of prion diseases are animals.;</docText>

NAMIBIA Wildlife Resorts (NWR) establishments owe the Treasury more than 
N$34,2 million in parks entrance fees.
This emerged in the National Assembly on Thursday.
 
Almost half of this amount has been outstanding since the 2000-01 fiscal year.
On Thursday, Minister of Environment and Tourism (MET), Philemon Malima, was 
asked by CoD whip Nora Schimming-Chase to explain the situation.
She also wanted to know when exactly these funds would be paid to the State.
Malima admitted that the NWR had failed to pay up.
He said the company had hoped to use the money to implement its business 
plan, which included urgent improvements to its resorts and service delivery.
This request, however, has been turned down by the Finance Ministry.
It has been proposed that the NWR take a loan instead.
It was not immediately clear whether the company has already used some of the 
millions owed to the State or if it was in a position to transfer the full 
amount.
"We should not rush to conclusions that it is just the same [as] parastatals 
that rip off the State Revenue. Give the NWR time to prove itself," said 
Malima.
In January the tourism industry was up in arms after the NWR announced that 
it would increase its day visitor fees to cover the costs incurred for using 
amenities such as swimming pools, spas, braai and ablution facilities.
A month later, the NWR agreed to retract the decision and said it would hold 
off on the increases until later in the year.</docText>

        <docText>State officials are working to vaccinate Florida panthers 
for feline leukemia, a deadly virus that has killed at least two panthers in the 
past few years.
A total of four panthers have been diagnosed with the disease since 2002. Two 
died from infection, one died after a fight with another panther, and another 
is still roaming the Okaloacoochee Slough.
Two capture teams with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
and the National Park Service are mounting a joint effort to stop the 
slow-moving, but deadly, virus in its tracks, vaccinating 16 panthers against the 
disease so far.
''It's hard to say what could happen because it's not happened before,'' said 
Mark Cunningham, wildlife veterinarian for the Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission. ``We're kind of taking it seriously and jumping on the 
problem early on.''
The virus can be passed during mating or during a fight or from mother to 
kitten.
SEEKING SOURCE
Researchers are trying to track down the source of the disease, but the 
suspicion is that it came from a panther run-in with domestic cats or feral cats, 
said National Park Service veterinarian Emmett Blankenship.
Some panther advocates support transplanting panthers to other parts of 
Florida to give them more room to roam.
Capture teams are focusing their vaccination campaign in Collier County, the 
southern part of the panthers' range, to try to keep the disease from 
spreading. So far, they have found no other cases, Cunningham said.</docText>

Ten years ago, Humane Society Silicon Valley housed 45,000 animals a year. 
Sadly, less than 15 percent of these animals were placed in loving homes. Most 
were euthanized due to lack of shelter space. Back then, our long-term vision 
was to eliminate the unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable pets at our shelter. 
The good news is this: Adoptable pets are no longer being euthanized at our 
shelter.
Today, fewer unwanted animals are entering our shelter, and more animals than 
ever before are finding homes. Last year, some 27,000 animals came to our 
shelter, 40 percent fewer than 10 years ago. Nearly 7,100, or 99 percent, of our 
adoptable animals found homes -- more than any other animal care facility in 
the Bay Area.
While we have made huge strides, much remains to be done. Last year, we 
euthanized 14,100 animals, and in the Bay Area, 50,000 pets were euthanized. In the 
United States, six to eight million animals are euthanized each year.
Why are so many animals still being euthanized? It isn't because we cannot 
find enough homes for these animals, or that we don't have enough shelter space. 
The real problem is that a majority of these animals are not adoptable. They 
are under-socialized, resulting in excessive shyness, fear and aggression; 
they have a history of biting; they have severe medical problems or they are very 
old.
Focusing only on ``adoptable'' pets trivializes the thousands of animal 
deaths that occur each year in our community. What we really need to ask ourselves 
is this: How did this animal get this way, and how do we reduce the number of 
unwanted, unadoptable animals?
Why should the public care? Because euthanizing unwanted animals is a 
community problem. It is a reflection of our society and how some of us treat other 
living things.</docText>

CONCORD, N.H. -- Even after five years, Christy Pugh has no trouble
sticking to her vegetarian regimen. The secret to her success? Eating meat.

Pugh is one of a growing number of part-time vegetarians whose loose
adherence to the meat-free diet is transforming a decades-old movement and
the industry that feeds it.

"Sometimes I feel like I'm a bad vegetarian, that I'm not strict enough or
good enough," the 28-year-old bookkeeper from Concord said recently. "I
really like vegetarian food but I'm just not 100 percent committed."

These so-called "flexitarians" - a term voted most useful word of 2003 by
the American Dialect Society - are motivated less by animal rights than by
a growing body of medical data that suggests health benefits from eating
more vegetarian foods.
...
In recent years the market for vegetarian friendly foods has exploded,
with items such as soy milk and veggie burgers showing up in mainstream
groceries and fast food restaurants.

But even the diet's activists say that growth can't be attributed to
committed vegetarians, who are estimated at about 3 percent of the adult
U.S. population, or about 5.7 million people never eating meat, poultry or
seafood.

Charles Stahler, co-director of the Baltimore-based Vegetarian Resource
Group, credits the growth to flexitarians - vegetarians who dabble in meat
and carnivores who seek out vegetarian meals.

"This is why Burger King has a veggie burger. It's not because of us," he
said. "The true vegetarians wouldn't rush to Burger King anyway. It's
because of those people in the middle. They are the driving audience."
...
"There is a big interest in vegetarianism," she said. "But we can also
tell from our readership that these are not people who are following a
pure vegetarian lifestyle. These are people who are integrating a
vegetarian menu in their current diets."

A similar change occurred at the 30-year-old Vegetarian Times, considered
the standardbearer of vegetarianism. Though still meat-free, the once
mostly vegan magazine focuses less on activism and more on recipes with
broader appeal.
...
Bruce Friedrich, spokesman for Norfolk, Va.-based People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, said he doesn't see any harm in vegetarianism
focusing more on food than the issues that spurred the movement.

"From our perspective, if people influenced by health consequently cut
back on fish and meat consumption, that helps animals," he said. "If two
people cut their meat in half it helps as much as one person going
completely vegetarian."</docText>

Recent policy changes at the Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals create an interesting dilemma for the community: What to do with 
homeless dogs and cats? The board of directors for a public charity determines the 
mission and policies of an organization. The Spay-Neuter Assistance Program, 
or SNAP, for example, has chosen to focus solely on spaying and neutering of 
dogs and cats as its mission, as opposed to animal sheltering and adoption 
programs. The HSPCA has decided it is no longer able to care for stray animals and 
instead it is going to focus its time and resources on the re-homing of owned 
pets, humane education, animal rescues and animal cruelty investigations. 
Prior to the policy change at the HSPCA, every one of the five animal 
sheltering agencies in Houston was 
already filled to capacity with homeless dogs and cats. The effect of the 
HSPCA policy shift will be to cause stray animals who would have been normally 
admitted (and euthanized) at the HSPCA to either be turned loose on the 
streets, where they will certainly multiply and most likely die from injury or 
disease, 
or to be admitted and euthanized at one of Houston's other animal sheltering 
agencies. 
The problem is not that the HSPCA has changed its policy. Rather, the problem 
is that there are very simply too many dogs and cats and not enough homes for 
them all. It's not a matter of "more" animals being euthanized. It's just a 
matter of which agency will be responsible for the destruction of homeless 
animals. 
The control of stray animals (and the diseases they spread, such as rabies) 
is clearly a function of government and its public health programs, not a 
function of private animal sheltering agencies. If the city of Houston and Harris 
County did more to prevent the breeding of cats and dogs and the proliferation 
of homeless puppies and kittens in the first place, there would be less of a 
need to destroy homeless animals in our community. </docText>

If you could be anyone for one day, who would you be? Paris Hilton? Donald
Trump? A world leader?

What about a vegetarian?

Let's face it. We live in a fast-food nation where greasy cheeseburgers
and oily fried chicken dominate the American diet. And while we know those
things are bad for us, making a change seems like too much work,
especially if it involves giving up meat all together. But what if it was
just for one day?

On March 20th, people across the country will trade burgers for textured
vegetable protein patties during the Great American Meatout -- a spinoff
of the Great American Smokeout. Vegetarianism isn't just about rabbit food
anymore, and health-food stores in all 50 states and several other
countries will be hosting special meat-free festivals and cookouts
featuring the numerous faux-meat products on the market.
...
According to Meatout's statistics, about 30 million Americans have
"explored" a meatless diet, meaning they've at least pledged to abstain
from meat for one day during a past Meatout event. Meatout promotes a
vegan diet (no eggs, dairy, or animal by-products), but according to
Moncrief, any reduction in meat intake is a step in the right direction.
The group encourages the single meat-free day as a way for people to
sample the vegetarian lifestyle.

"It helps when people can try it out for a day and not have to be gung-ho
about it," says Roads. "You don't have to throw everything away in your
kitchen and start over. You can just see what's it's like and maybe start
doing it once a week." </docText>

The results of a new survey conducted for the Alpharetta-based United Egg 
Producers indicate consumers would prefer and would be willing to pay more for 
eggs that come from farms following animal welfare guidelines. 
The survey, conducted last November, was conducted with 300 American 
consumers age 18 or older. 
The aim was to assess attitudes toward egg products produced under guidelines 
designed to improve the welfare of laying hens. 
The United Egg Producers reports that more than 200 egg companies 
representing 85 percent of the eggs produced in the United States have implemented the 
group's animal welfare guidelines. Eggs produced under the guidelines carry a 
logo with the words "Animal Care Certified." 
Of those questioned in the recent survey, 50 percent stated they would 
"definitely or probably purchase" eggs carrying the logo. An additional 34 percent 
stated they would "possibly or maybe purchase" such eggs. 
Price was not a major factor to most of those surveyed. Nearly one-third (32 
percent) of those surveyed stated they would be willing to spend 5 percent 
more for Animal Care Certified eggs if the cost was higher. Twenty-two percent 
reported willingness to spend 10 percent more. 
However, the single majority, 36 percent, stated they would not be willing to 
spend more for such eggs. 
"These results are encouraging to the egg industry as well as all industries 
faced with animal welfare issues," Gene Gregory, senior vice president of the 
United Egg Producers, said in a statement. "The Animal Care Certified 
standards have required significant commitment by our members, and it is rewarding to 
see that these efforts are paying off in grocer's egg cases across the </docText>

It?s sometimes hard to recall that Berkeley was once just another American
town, whose citizens cooked, served, and ate what Americans everywhere did.
...
Rich developed her love for vegetarian cooking while attending Stanford.
"I made a lot of vegan things for the people in my co-op," she says, "but
tried to be creative 
 to make something more than ?co-op slop,? where you
throw stuff into a big wok and stir it around." She became interested in
raw food through her reading in "health philosophy," although over time
political, social, and ethical issues have become interwoven with her
purely health-oriented concerns. She honed her skills in food preparation
and presentation while operating an East Bay catering company, Artemisia
Foods, before taking the chef?s job at Caf? Muse this past winter. It?s
her first-ever restaurant gig.

Caf? Muse now features half a dozen raw dishes on its menu daily, along
with a variety of more conventionally prepared sandwiches, soups, and
salads. Hence, if you?re seeking a change from your standard deli sandwich
? even though in this "deli" you?d be lunching on organically raised
chicken, Niman Ranch pastrami, and dolphin-safe tuna salad ? you can
experiment with a pad Thai whose "noodles" are peeled from the flesh of
young coconuts, served with a Thai-style sauce made from pure?d Fresno
chiles, medjool dates, Celtic sea salt, garlic, and rice vinegar.

None of the ingredients in this or the other raw dishes are cooked above
110 degrees Fahrenheit ? which means, essentially, that they?re not cooked
at all. Foodies are familiar with this approach because of the success
achieved by Roxanne Klein in her eponymous (and profoundly upscale) Marin
County restaurant, Roxanne?s. And healthy-eating advocates have pursued
raw-food regimens of one kind or another for years, though most have
failed to reach a broader audience. 
...
The Berkeley dining revolution of 1971 has consolidated its gains around
the nation. Will Caf? Muse warrant a full chapter in Sarah Rich?s memoirs
30 years hence? Or will "raw food" be remembered as a passing craze, the
way foodies now look back on "fusion" and pink peppercorns? If commitment,
dedication, and deliciousness are the criteria for lasting success,
failure may find Caf? Muse, Adagia, and their nascent ilk a hard (and
decidedly raw) nut to Swallow.</docText>

On June 1, 2001, fires were set at the Schoppert Logging Company in Eagle
Creek, Oregon. Schoppert was due to begin logging on US Forrest Service
land. One whole logging truck, valued $50,000 was destroyed and two others
damaged. This was terrorism, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force said.
Indictments came down with charges of 1) damaging vehicles and other
property used in interstate commerce, 2) obstructing the movement of
commodities in interstate commerce, 3) using violence to interfere in
commerce and 4) using an incindiery device to commit an act of violence.
If convicted, defendents could recieve up to $1 million in fines or up to
80 years in prison, more than twelve times the average sentence for rape,
a class one felony.

Recently, environmental activist and tree-sitter Tre Arrow, wanted by the
FBI, was taken into custody by Canadian authorities in British Colombia
for shoplifting a pair of bolt-cutters. He is accused by authorities of
the Schoppert Logging fire and of being a member of the Earth Liberation
Front, America's #1 domestic terrorist organization.

With each new horrific assault on human life that occurs in this world, we
are inundated with streams of hollow rhetoric used to rationalize, not to
justify, whatever stance the government takes. Terrorism no longer has
anything to do with fear, freedom does not have any relation to rights,
and violence has nothing to do with harm to living things. Particularly
since 9/11, governments and corporations have demanded that we accept as
truth things that are either outright contradictions or examples of what
is known as false concreteness, the assumption that irrelevant association
leads to substantive conclusions with far reaching implications. Some of
the contradictions we are told to swallow are eternal, like the idea that
waging war brings peace or that security only comes at the expense of
liberty. Others, like the idea that invading Iraq would make us safer or
that conspicuous consumption is effective counter-terrorism, serve the
interests of the powerful.

Welcome then, to the propaganda of what the Zapatista rebels of Chiapas,
Mexico dubbed the Fourth World War, the struggle between the culture of
life and the culture of death, of neoliberalism against humanity, of power
against truth. </docText>

        <docText>nlike the football team, these Detroit lions looked like winners, 
even after a 1,500-mile, 30-hour ride from Motown to Texas in moving vans. 
Two aging lions formerly known by pet names Nikkia and Sheba sniffed around 
their new 3/8-acre enclosure Wednesday. 
They crept along its chain-link fences, and napped amid its rocks, trees and 
grass. 
If all goes well, the two Asian-African hybrid females, 20 and 18, will live 
another five to 10 years at Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation, a nonprofit 
refuge with about 500 animals. 
The two new guests, and two young African adults, a female and a mane-less, 
neutered male, were released into their new homes, secured by a 9-foot 
electrified fence, Wednesday morning. 
Their new environment includes jaguars, emus and a wooded hillside. Just 30 
miles from San Antonio, they'll have little human interaction, if sanctuary 
founder and executive director Lynn Cuny has her way ? again. 
In 1977, Cuny began taking in wild animals in her San Antonio back yard on 
Clower Street. 
Now, as the refuge nears completion of its move from Boerne to a 187-acre 
site near Kendalia, it is taking in its first lions, 400- to 600-pound 
meat-eaters. 
"This is part of the puzzle of creating a new sanctuary," Cuny said of the 
four lions from the Belle Isle Zoo, a branch facility associated with the 
Detroit Zoo. 
The younger cats were pets before living in a zoo. 
As a cub, the female was malnourished. In 1997, police found the male in a 
car's back seat ? and that's neglect, even in the Motor City. 
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick cut funding for the 13-acre Belle Isle Zoo in 
2002. 
A lawsuit filed by the Detroit City Council to restore funding failed, and 
most of the zoo's 160 animals have since been moved to other zoos or 
sanctuaries. 
The four lions lived in a grassy enclosure at Belle Isle, but will have more 
room in Texas, said Scott Carter, director of conservation and animal welfare 
with the Detroit Zoological Institute, which donated $26,000 for the lions' 
new home. </docText>

NEW YORK - Martha Stewart may be a felon, but in what's left of this city's 
long-suffering Fur District, she was a hero. By early last week, furrier Larry 
Cowit had heard from not one but two customers who "had to have" that luxe 
scarf Stewart was wearing after she got the bad news.

Was that chinchilla or rex rabbit framing Martha's sober mug splashed all 
over television?

"There's a silver lining in every bit of bad news," said Cowit.

Martha's lining, it turns out, was dyed chinchilla, and the silver will be 
going to Cowit and his brother, Steve, the third generation to run Henry Cowit 
Inc. He estimated he'd charge less than $2,000 a scarf.

After two dreadful decades - years of watching their friends go bust or 
retire to Florida - the Manhattan furriers are happy to revel in a few good turns 
of events: Finally, last year, national retail sales in fur bounced back to 
1984's $1.8 billion high. Finally, winter back East is bitter again. Finally, the 
paint throwers with ethical objections to wearing anything that once had a 
mother are widening their scope to target animal-research labs, taking heat off 
furriers.

And most important, finally, the fur is, yes, flying again on the runways. 
From Paris to New York this spring, designers who could barely afford to put on 
shows were trimming their fall suits to sports clothes in dyed everything - 
rabbit, lamb, pony and, of course, chinchilla.

So guys like Larry and Steve Cowit can maybe take it easier during summer. 
And play a little golf.</docText>

A dog is there for the taking. He can't talk back. He can't say, stop,
you're killing me, you're treating me like a dog. Six years ago, Margery
Glickman happened upon a couple of hundred dogs that, if they could have
spoken, would have said just that.

Glickman was vacationing in Alaska. She came for the scenery but saw
instead a "dog farm." Animals were tethered to stakes by chains,
belligerent in their confinement, drinking filthy water, sitting, as she
said, "in their own fecal matter." This was a breeding place for the
Iditarod. Glickman was perplexed.

Even back home in Miami, Glickman had heard of the Iditarod. It was a
1,149-mile dog sled race in the middle of winter across Alaska. Designed
to commemorate the diphtheria run that saved lives in 1925, the Iditarod
had become romantic legend, courageous mushers crossing forests, rivers,
tundra and mountain ranges with enthusiastic canines. What glory! Ah, but
where was the glory in this?

"I was appalled," she said.

Glickman had never been an activist in her life. She was a first-grade
teacher. She was a mom. She was in Alaska to relax. Problem was, she couldn't.
...
The Iditarod is a money-maker. Glickman, 56, has launched Sled Dog Action
Coalition, a nonprofit volunteer-only organization. She has been so
successful, sponsors like Pizza Hut, Pfizer and Costco have dropped out.
She has received death threats, enough of them so that she doesn't go to
Alaska.

"It is unconscionable," Glickman said. "They (mushers) say they love their
dogs, but they don't love their dogs. It is an act of barbarism. It is a
shameless, bloody business."</docText>

On March 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson launched
public service announcements depicting dismembered body parts of fat
people -- double chins, stomachs, buttocks, and thighs -- caught in
grocery cart wheels, found by children along the beach and tripped over by
mall shoppers. They're part of Thompson's efforts to educate Americans
about obesity and persuade them to change their eating habits by showing
fat people what they should "lose."1

Meat

CSPI: CSPI's Perfect Diet states vegetarian diets are best and red meat is
"Heart Disease Enemy No. 1" and should be avoided because of its
"artery-clogging saturated fat." According to CSPI's A Dozen Diet Do's and
Don'ts, even lean meats are bad because they're not labeled so you don't
really know how much fat may be hidden in them. "Meat has also been linked
to cancer of the colon and prostate."

Facts: Scares over a link between red meat and cancer have been repeatedly
challenged by researchers.13 According to ACSH, scientists have found red
meat offers numerous healthful benefits. Meat protein helps build strong
muscles and appears to improve bone density in all ages, according to the
2002 Rancho Bernardo Study published in the American Journal of
Epidemiology. Meats, poultry and seafood are some of our best sources for
essential B vitamins and certain minerals, and play a significant role in
lowering our risk for heart disease.14 Beef is the biggest dietary source
of vitamin B12 and appears beneficial at lowering homocysteine, said
Klurfeld. Homocysteine is believed to be a major risk factor for heart
disease, as significant as cholesterol, yet nearly a third of vegetarians
have elevated levels as compared to 5% of meat-eaters. "Even though a
vegetarian diet can lower serum cholesterol, the opposite effect on
homocysteine could offset any potential benefit," he said.

Two horses graze at the G and L Ranch on Dayton Road. Authorities suspect a 
combination of disease and crowded conditions killed four horses recently at 
the ranch. 




Fast Facts 
The organism that causes "strangles" is streptococci equi. It is highly 
contagious and spreads from horse to horse by either direct contact or when an 
infected horse is introduced to the herd, said Dr. Julie Carson, an area 
veterinarian. 
Streptococci equi only affects horses, cannot be spread to humans and is not 
necessarily fatal, Carson said. 
The organism causes fever, pain in the jaw and abscesses around lymph nodes 
under the jaw, she said. Streptococci equi itself does not cause the horse to 
die, but the conditions it causes can lead to death, she said. 
Infected horses should be isolated, fed last and kept in clean stables. 
Caretakers should decontaminate water, feeding buckets and any other items that 
come in contact with infected horses, she said. 
A vaccine is available by injection or nasal spray, she said. 


Crowded conditions, under-feeding and a highly contagious infection known as 
"strangles" may have caused the death of four horses at a Newark farm, 
authorities said. 
Other animals were found in emaciated condition. 
Animal control officils are investigating Lisa Fallon, 48, who has 32 horses 
and numerous other animals at the G and L ranch, 1346 Dayton Road, said 
Licking County Animal Control Director Jon Luzio. 
Fallon said the herd was stricken with "strangles" during the winter and 
refused to comment further. Fallon told investigators one recently purchased 
horse, now deceased, was infected and spread the organism to nearly every horse in 
the herd, Luzio said. </docText>

A Perry County man pleaded "not guilty" to cruelty to animals on Thursday in 
connection with the deaths of 31 chickens.
James Cochran, 24, entered his plea before Perry County District Court Judge 
Richard Avery Jr. A trial is scheduled for May 10.
"The case is pending, and we'll be trying it in District Court," said Don 
McMillian, Perry County assistant district attorney.
Cochran's charge, a Class B misdemeanor, stems from the alleged starving of 
several chickens at his residence. A representative from the People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals discovered the chickens in November 2003 after a 
telephone call alerted the organization.
Cochran's attorney, James Barnes, couldn't be reached for comment.
According to Amy Rhodes, senior animals in entertainment specialist with 
PETA, a PETA activist in Birmingham was contacted after she got the call. The 
representative, along with a Perry County Sheriff's Department deputy, went to 
Cochran's home and allegedly discovered 81 chickens, 31 of them dead and many 
malnourished.
"It is suspected that the animals were being bred for use in illegal 
cockfighting," Rhodes said. "People who demonstrate such blatant disregard for life 
and desensitization to suffering can pose a serious risk to the people and 
animals with whom they come in contact."
In a letter to McMillian, Rhodes states that several roosters had their combs 
removed. "This, as you may know, is a routine practice in the cockfighting 
industry - the combs are removed so that when roosters are forced to fight one 
another, they cannot grab one another's combs," she adds.</docText>

Speaking at the Menninger Foundation in 1963, the distinguished
anthropologist Margaret Mead said about mental health, "We know of no
human society that does not distinguish between permissible and
impermissible killing."

As a hunter or fisherman, did you ever think about yourself as practicing
"permissible killing?" Probably not.
...
The physical distance between the butcher's knife creates a psychological
distance that enables us to separate ourselves from the act of killing,
thus enabling us to avoid, or lessen, guilt feelings.

The denial of the importance of killing animals to put food on the table
creates a false illusion of goodness that prevents us from experiencing
emotions that touch some of the deepest parts of the human soul and enable
us to come to feel honest reverence for life.

The most common way people come to appreciate killing animals for food is
through hunting. Hunters kill millions of animals per year: 50 million
doves, 25 million rabbits and squirrels, 25 million quail, 20 million
pheasants, 10 million ducks, 4 to 5 million deer, 150, 000 elk, and more
than 20,000 black bears.
...
This is a sizeable number of people, but only about 5 percent of the U.S.
population hunts. Another roughly 5 percent belong to anti-hunting
organizations and generally eat little or no meat.

That leaves 90 percent of the general public who do not hunt or belong to
anti-hunting groups, but the vast majority of them eat meat. Meat eating
seems here to stay, especially in the wake of recent scientific support
for the Atkins diet and other high-protein diets.
...
Note: Some of the folks who work with animals in a humane way that may
include killing ? breeders, ranchers, scientists, furriers, hunters and
entertainers ? are going to be holding an important conference May 28-29
in Washington, D.C., to discuss the damage done to them by animal-rights
people and what can be done about it. For details, visit this Web site.

James Swan ? who has appeared in more than a dozen feature films,
including "Murder in the First" and "Star Trek: First Contact," as well as
the television series "Nash Bridges," "Midnight Caller" and "Modern
Marvels" ? is the author of the book "In Defense of Hunting."

Would you leave a profession with a reasonable expectation of a steady
income to start a business in which you have absolutely no experience?
Would you open a restaurant without a cook-stove? Would you open a
restaurant if you had to furnish it with tables and chairs from your own
house and donations from friends? Would you jump off a 300-foot cliff
without a parachute? Susan Mullen did.

Actually, she didn't literally jump off a 300-foot cliff without a
parachute. However, that is a reasonably accurate metaphor for what she
did in her professional and financial life when she opened Susie's
Vegetarian at 423 North LBJ, Suite E.
...
"Though I wasn't a vegetarian at the time, my vegan friends encouraged me
and convinced me that what this community really needs is a vegetarian
restaurant. I could have done a bakery, a pie factory or something of that
sort. But my friends convinced me that we need something for people who
wish to practice a healthier life-style.

On April 2, 2003, Susan opened Susie's Veggies on the Run. Much has
changed since then, including the name. It opened as a carryout - hence
the original name - but it has morphed into a sit down place with several
tables. More about the tables later.
...
Susan explained that her place is not your standard eating experience -
fast foods or otherwise. Every Wednesday night she and her customers have
a Sing-Out for Peace. Some folks just want to come in and talk. Politics
is a popular subject. Others find Susan's Vegetarian a good place to
exhibit art works. She has purposely kept her walls bare of murals or
other art so that painters, photographers and other graphic artists can
display their work. The artwork changes with the whims of the owner and
the artists.

"I realize my place fills a niche. I spend a little extra money to buy
baking powder with no aluminum. I buy organic products when possible. I
get people here from Weight-Watchers, the low-carb people and others who
are looking for special diets. I can deal with wheat allergies and people
who don't eat dairy products or eggs. And I can make it taste good. First
and foremost, I am a cook - was long before I became a vegetarian."

        <docText>Paul Watson leans back into a fluffy couch
surrounded by swords and confides that his reputation as a crazed,
eco-terrorist pirate actually helps him perform his mission.

He used to have to actually ram and sink whaling ships to be effective,
Watson explains. Now he's considered so dangerous that all he has to do is
show up.
...
Along the way, Watson has earned two wildly different reputations -- one
as the brave cult hero willing to risk his life for endangered animals,
the other as the high-seas vigilante and fatherly mentor to eco-saboteurs
everywhere.

Today, Watson, 53, is perhaps more beloved and reviled than ever. As
Hollywood aims to immortalize him with a movie about his life, critics
cast him as the villain trying to hijack the Sierra Club.

He crashed the country's oldest and largest environmental club last year
by getting elected to its 15-member board. Watson now is widely suspected
of plotting with like-minded animal-rights activists and
population-control advocates to take over the club. 
...
The Farley Mowat is a 46-year-old Norwegian research vessel outfitted with
water guns, a cannon that fires 2-inch balls, and loudspeakers. The sign
in the galley says, "Ocean Warrior." The vegan cook is Alex Cornelissen.

Cornelissen, 35, sold his house and quit his graphics artist job in
Amsterdam, Netherlands, to join Sea Shepherd soon after hearing Watson
speak. He crewed on an anti-whaling run last year to Antarctica and was
later arrested in Japan with Watson's wife for diving into a fishermen's
net and freeing 15 dolphins.

Regrets about hooking up with Sea Shepherd? "It was the best decision I've
made in my life," he says. </docText>

The footage is ugly. 
Palatka Police Department officers have arrived at the scene of a call and 
have been led around to the back yard where two hefty dogs are fighting. The 
black one has latched on to the nape of the brown and white one's neck and is 
swinging its head back and forth in a death grip.
As the owners try to separate the dogs with shovels and water hoses, the 
yelps of the brown and white dog are clearly audible on the police videotape.
Two pit bulls have somehow broken their chains and began doing what they were 
raised to do - fight to the death.
Eventually the dogs are separated. They will have to be put down, but not 
until they go through the court system and the police department is officially 
cleared to do so.
Technically, the raising and fighting of pit bulls is called animal cruelty. 
Officials say it is the biggest, but certainly not the only, problem facing 
the city's understaffed animal control unit.
Wendy Cook served as the animal control officer for about a year, but has 
transferred to another department. She sits on the Putnam County Animal Control 
Board of Directors and lists other major problems as ferral cats, ferral dogs 
and, with summer approaching, animals being left in vehicles while their owners 
run errands.
"Our job is to protect these animals, whether they are ferral, strays, 
whether they are fighting, the ones who are being suffocated in cars," Cook said 
this week.
" We have been labeled animal killers, but that isn't true. We hold 
everything for at least three to five days, and we don't euthanize everything. The are 
so many rescue groups - the humane society, Tracy Varnes, who is right here in 
the county, all over Florida, from out of state. We've had over 2,000 animals 
placed since August." </docText>

        <docText>Angered by the killing of a baby llama at the Salisbury 
Zoological Park, Del. Norman Conway, D-38-Wicomico, hopes to pass new legislation in 
Annapolis calling for stiffer penalties for crimes against animals. 
"I was able to introduce it late and we have a short time frame so we have to 
move quickly," he said. "I definitely believe that this is legislation that 
couldn't wait." 
Conway said House Bill 1546 was inspired by the Shannon Ray Hitchens case in 
which the 24-year-old Parsonsburg man allegedly broke into the zoo and fatally 
stabbed a 5-day-old llama. 
During his March 8 sentencing in Wicomico County Circuit Court, Hitchens 
accepted an Alford plea -- a guilty plea in which the defendant does not admit 
guilt but concedes that there is enough evidence to convict him -- to the charge 
of felony animal mutilation. The charge carries a maximum of three years in 
prison. 
Judge Kathleen Beckstead suspended all but 18 months of the three-year 
sentence and gave Hitchens credit for the six months he had already served in jail, 
leaving him with less than a year remaining. 
"He got a year, but with good behavior he could be out in six months," 
Detective Schejn Oliphant, the Salisbury police officer who investigated the case, 
said after the trial. "If he gets work release he could be out in time for 
summer." 
If passed, HB 1546 will increase the penalty for aggravated cruelty to 
animals from three years in jail and a $5,000 fine to six years imprisonment and a 
$10,000 fine. 
The last day of the General Assembly session is April 12. 
Conway said Thursday that HB 1546 passed the House of Delegates with 138 of 
141 votes and is headed to 
BILL, from Page A1 
the Rules Committee, then the Judiciary Committee before it goes to the 
Senate. </docText>

Crocodiles killed 18 people in the area last 
year, it is said. 

Aketch has heard it all before. 

He was once called in to hunt a croc that had 
eaten a young boy. He shot a large one and when 
it was cut open, the child's head was found inside. 

Aketch Aduor, like many hunters, considers himself a 
conservationist. In his long career he has not shot 
during the nesting season and only takes animals that 
are over five feet long. 

"You can't kill off your source," he says. 

Now a successful Blantyre businessman with interests 
in construction, Aketch says he can get about $200 
a skin although he no longer needs the money. 

He now has a permit for only 25 crocodiles a year. 
Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES), Malawi's annual export quota of the 
reptile's skins is capped at 200. 

"They are not letting us remove enough of the animals," 
Aketch said -- adding that poor villagers are suffering 
the consequences.

        <docText>The arrival in Hong Kong this week of a batch of frozen chickens, 
ending an import ban imposed as avian flu raged across Asia, received a 
chilly reception in the territory where appetites remain insatiable for fresh 
birds. 
Hong Kong has been without a constant supply of chicken, the city?s favourite 
meat, for at least two months since imports from Asian suppliers were banned 
as bird flu spread through the region.
But even after the suspension was partially lifted Monday to allow 24,000 
frozen or chilled chickens in from China, diners were turning their noses up. 
They still wanted fresh chicken -- alive and ready for slaughter.
Eating freshly-killed poultry is a generations-old gastronomic tradition in 
southern China. Markets and stores are usually alive with the squawk of caged 
fowl.
But over the past two months the territory has been forced to cut down on its 
daily intake of the birds as outbreaks in China of avian flu, strains of 
which can kill humans, prompted authorities here to ban imports.
As mainland China is Hong Kong?s single largest source of poultry, 
consumption plunged from 150,000 chickens a day to just over 20,000.
The resumption of imports of chilled and frozen chicken on Monday, however, 
did nothing to satiate Hong Kong?s craving for chicken.
?Meat from live chickens tastes very different from frozen chicken,? 
complained Emily Ng, a 34-year-old mother of two, as she shopped for dinner in a 
bustling food market in the Wan Chai district.
?Chilled meat is no good at all. It has no flavour and is less chewy,? she 
added.</docText>

The first rodeo competition is thought to have been held in Cheyenne,
Wyo., more than a hundred years ago. With all the hoopla surrounding
RodeoHouston -- the world's largest -- and news that general attendance
set a new record this year, the event seems poised to flourish for at
least another hundred.

But don't count on it.

Animal advocates across the board are determined to see that this American
tradition, at least as we know it today, becomes American history.

From the controversial People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to
mainstream organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States,
animal-interest groups are working to end the use of animals in circuses
and rodeos. Their investigative work and media savvy have caused others to
take notice, and the cause is picking up support.

A referendum to ban the display of wild or exotic animals is on the ballot
this year in Denver. If it's successful, the city will be the largest in
the United States to pass such a measure. The zoo, aquarium and rodeo were
excluded from the proposed ban, but circuses with animals and other types
of menageries would be prohibited from setting up there. 
...
In 2004, the animal crusade in Houston is stronger than ever before.
Houston has two organized animal-rights groups based here, numerous animal
welfare/protection organizations and a vegan/animal-rights radio show
working to raise awareness about the plight of animals. Activists have
demonstrated at some of the rodeo shows this year, waving signs that read
"Animal Abuse is Not Entertainment and Buck the Rodeo!" and "The Animals
Lose Every Time" at buses entering Reliant Park.</docText>

        <docText>A U.S. District Court judge this week will unseal a search
warrant and affidavit that could reveal why the FBI arrested a peace
activist it never charged in connection with ecoterrorism in the San
Gabriel Valley.

Pomona resident Josh Connole's attorney said the decision by the U.S.
Attorney's Office to no longer oppose the unsealing of the affidavits,
just 10 days after another man was charged with the crimes, is a "tacit
admission' that the FBI arrested the wrong man the first time.
...
Connole has fought to have the documents unsealed to clear his name in the
Aug. 22 attacks, saying the FBI has a history of "smearing peace activists.'

Connole, 25, claims he was arrested because of his opposition to the Iraq
war, and that the documents will show the FBI falsely arrested him.
...
Caltech student and Pasadena resident William Cottrell, 23, has been
indicted on nine counts connected with the arson and graffiti attacks that
destroyed 133 vehicles and caused $3.5 million in damages. If convicted on
all counts, he faces 35 years to life in federal prison.

Earth Liberation Front, an international ecoterrorist group advocating
economic sabotage to protect the environment, took credit for the attacks
on sport utility vehicles at car dealerships and residences in the Valley,
spurring a massive FBI investigation.
...
Connole is a vegan and a self-described antiwar peace activist who lives
in a co-op in Pomona that promotes communal living, environmental
sustainability and social justice.

Here's a new twist to the old chicken vs. egg de bate: On the production
line, the egg has to come first, but thanks to new animal-care standards,
a chicken's lot in life is looking decidedly better.

A few area producers have adopted new nationally developed animal-welfare
guidelines that promote better living conditions for egg-laying hens. They
say the results have been remarkable.

"We got larger eggs, and more of them," said Paul Sauder, the
third-generation president of Sauder's Quality Eggs in Lititz, which
recently applied the standards with a test flock. "The chickens were
significantly healthier, and their laying lives were extended. In every
indicator, the hens kept under the new animal-care standards were nothing
less than amazing." 

Sauder's did away with beak-trimming, which was designed to prevent
cannibalism, and began maintaining air quality in the chickenhouse at a
higher standard. The chickens were fed during a resting period in which
food was sometimes withheld.

The egg producer also reduced the number of hens it housed in each cage
from nine to seven. 
...
Based on scientific research conducted over two years by an independent
advisory committee commissioned by United Egg Producers, the animal-care
standards for hens have still received criticism for not going far enough.

Animal-rights groups want to abolish the practice of beak-trimming, among
other concerns.

Sauder's and other companies market free-range eggs for consumers with
ethical concerns, but those cartons cost up to three times as much as eggs
from caged chickens. And Sauder notes that free-range birds are less
protected against disease. </docText>

Baily was lucky. 
The white Maltese disappeared March 9 from an Island Park home, and by 
nightfall Baily's owners, including Chelsea Yakavuski, had put up 15 missing 
posters. 
Later that night, the family received an anonymous call stating that a couple 
in a white tow truck picked up the dog the night before. Yakavuski went 
line-by-line through the phone book and called every local towing company, but 
there was still no trace of Baily. 
More signs went up, ads were taken out in the newspaper and the family 
canvassed the neighborhood. 
Their legwork paid off a week later when they received a call from a woman in 
Arcadia who said she had Baily. The family retrieved the dog the next day and 
a new sign went up in Island Park thanking neighbors for their help and 
support ? Baily is home. 
"We have no clue how he got there, but we knew we would get him back," 
Yakavuski said. "There were people who doubted us, but we love this dog more than 
anything." 
More than two million pets are stolen every year across the country, though 
not many are granted homecomings like Baily's, said Chris DeRose, president of 
the Los Angeles based animal advocacy group Last Chance for Animals. 
DeRose estimated that one-third to one-half of stolen pets are sold to 
research firms, while others are sold to breeding companies (especially pure-bred 
males), some are used as food for both exotic animals and humans, while others 
are trained to fight. Some, DeRose said, are runaways or legitimately missing 
and, though rare, some family pets are held for ransom. 
"It's a nation-wide problem," DeRose said. "It goes on everywhere." </docText>

        <docText>Nine lives, nine months. One's a myth, one's the age of an 
angel. 
Cats, it is said, possess nine lives. Not true, although it sometimes seems a 
fact as they wile their way from disaster to disaster with nary a scratch. 
Emily Douglas is 9-months old, a documented fact. Now, Emily is in possession 
of one cat, Wilmington, which, if the myth is true, has eight lives left in 
reserve after happening on a knight in shining Huggies.
Emily is the daughter of Bob Douglas, Wilmington's new conservation agent, a 
title which, until last week, did not normally extend to felines of any 
vintage or life number. Now, after three kittens were found alone and abandoned on 
the steps of Town Hall, conservation agent may well extend to those remaining 
eight lives multiplied by three. After all, Wilmington the cat, Wilma for 
short, came from that box and owes at least some of her remaining time to Douglas 
and his family.

Question: What are the different animal welfare groups operating in the 
Roseburg area and what services do they provide? -- M.F. of Roseburg 



Answers: The New Beginnings SPCA, the Saving Grace Pet Adoption Center and 
the Umpqua Valley Humane Society all work to improve the lives of dogs and cats 
and to ensure that pets are loved and wanted.


Members try to find homes for homeless cats, dogs and rabbits. However, the 
group is limited in the number of animals that can be taken in. New Beginnings 
also provides vouchers to low-income families to help pay for the cost of 
having a pet spayed or neutered. In addition, the group cares for feral cats. 
Donations of pet food is accepted both for the feral cat program and to provide to 
low-income residents.

The group hopes to be able to establish a no-kill shelter, where animals 
would not be euthanized simply because they were unwanted or had behavioral 
problems. Under the group's philosophy, an animal should be put to sleep only if it 
has a serious health condition that is contagious to other animals or if the 
animal is suffering and can't be cured. New Beginnings can be contacted at 
464-4313.

Saving Grace was established by a group of animal lovers in 2001 with the 
intent of taking over operation of the Douglas County animal shelter at 943 Del 
Rio Road in Winchester. Former Sheriff Jim Main became concerned that cats and 
dogs brought to the shelter were being euthanized almost as soon as they were 
brought in.

Under private operation, the shelter could keep animals longer and could try 
to place dogs and cats with other shelters located in Western Oregon. The 
county was not able to do that. The shelter takes in strays, along with animals 
given up by their owners. The group is looking to expand the shelter so that 
more dogs and cats can be kept there.</docText>

On March 22, 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin and Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Minister Bob Speller announced $995-million in assistance for Canadian farmers 
who face historic financial challenges brought on by circumstances beyond 
their control. This funding will also help producers? transition to new business 
risk management programming.
"The Canadian cattle and beef industry is a real success story, but it has 
been devastated by extended border closures, which are beyond its control," said 
Prime Minister Martin. "The government is providing the industry with this 
much needed assistance to help producers manage until borders are fully 
reopened."
"Farm income across Canada dropped to historic lows in 2003, affecting all 
commodities. Canadian farmers face these unprecedented challenges at the same 
time that they are moving to a new permanent income and disaster assistance 
program," said Minister Speller. "Today's funding will not only help our cattle 
producers through a difficult period but also the whole of the agriculture 
sector, which has weathered a number of shocks and unforeseen events in the last 
couple of years."
The Transitional Industry Support Program will provide a total of 
$680-million to cattle producers who have faced a prolonged closure of the Canada-U.S. 
border. The funding will be delivered as a direct payment of up to $80 per 
eligible bovine animal on inventory as of December 31, 2003. Eligible animals will 
include all bovine animals except mature bulls and cows (cows that have calved 
and intact bulls older than one year). Similar measures will be available for 
producers of other ruminants who have lost access to the U.S. market.</docText>

While at Radnor High School, Josh Balk could list the vital statistics of
virtually every baseball player in the major leagues. From batting
averages to home run records, Balk, who is still the all-time leader in
strikeouts and wins at Radnor High, lived baseball. 

Today however, Balk, has memorized some other statistics. Rather than
giving predictions for the Cubs? chances next year, he can detail the
cruelties endured by animals on factory farms.

"Egg-laying hens are caged so tightly they can?t even flap their wings,"
Balk says. He continues, "It would be illegal to castrate a dog without
painkiller in the U.S., yet this is exactly what happens to tens of
millions of cattle and pigs each year with no legal repercussions whatsoever."

Balk, 24, the son of Jim and Wendy Balk of Radnor, works for Compassion
Over Killing (COK), a non-profit animal advocacy organization based in
Takoma Park, Md.
...
After attending a talk by Miyun Park, the president of Compassion Over
Killing, Balk decided to become vegan, a vegetarian who does not eat eggs
or dairy products.

Park hired Balk a year ago to head the organization?s vegetarian outreach
efforts, and he now works to let as many people as possible know their
message: "We can help stop animal cruelty with every bite we take," Balk
says. "We have no nutritional need for meat, eggs, or dairy, yet we cause
immense amounts of suffering when we buy these products."
...
Campaigns conducted by Compassion Over Killing include an exhibit at the
National Mall on "Factory Farming in America," a free "Vegetarian Starter
Guide" program, a restaurant outreach program, a campaign against the use
of animals in the circus, vegetarian leafleting and investigations into
cruelty.

Balk said COK works to end animal abuse, primarily focusing on cruelty to
animals in agriculture. COK helps make vegetarian eating as easy as
possible with free vegetarian starter guides, recipe booklets, restaurant
guides, and web sites like TryVeg.com.

The nonprofit Center for a New American Dream, whose stated mission is to 
"help Americans consume responsibly to protect the environment, enhance quality 
of life and promote social justice," says that America's growing obsession with 
acquisition is taking a heavy toll on the environment. 
According to the group's president, Betsy Taylor, the U.S. consumes more 
energy, water, paper, steel and meat per capita than any other country -- so much 
so that at least four additional planets would be needed to provide the 
American lifestyle if every person on Earth were to demand it. Meanwhile, forests 
are being lost at an alarming rate, farmlands and wetlands are being engulfed by 
development, plant and animal species are disappearing and our air and water 
continue to be threatened by pollution. 
Participants of New Dream's Web-based Turn the Tide program follow "nine 
little actions" to try to reduce their personal impact on the environment, 
including skipping car trips, eating one less beef meal a week, reducing water use 
and installing energy-efficient light bulbs. The program enables participants to 
track the positive impact of their actions -- and see the cumulative impact 
of all he program's participants across North America.

Dear EarthTalk: I've heard that conventional lice treatments contain toxic 
chemicals. Are safer, more natural alternatives available? 
-- Dwayne Newton, Charleston, S.C. 
The National Pediculosis Association (NPA) advises consumers to be cautious 
with conventional lice treatments, including shampoos and lotions, since they 
contain toxic, and in some cases carcinogenic, pesticides. 
The NPA says that people with epilepsy, asthma, brain tumors, cancer or AIDS, 
as well as pregnant or nursing women, should completely avoid any chemical 
lice medications. Further, the NPA is calling on the medical community to 
address the current "resistance crisis" of lice becoming increasingly resistant to 
pesticide treatments. </docText>

Rome, Italy, Mar. 25 ?? According to the Italian society for prevention of 
cruelty to animals some 7,100 animals were subject to acts of cruelty, compared 
to a prior record of 4,000 in 2002. The figures are a conservative estimate 
according to the Lega antivivisezione, LAV (the Italian anti-vivisection 
league). LAV is hosting a four day event - March 27,28 and April 3,4 ?? aimed at 
collecting petitions in 400 Italian squares in favour of parliamentary bill on all 
forms of cruelty to animals. LAV??s report indicates that abuse charges were 
levelled in 269 separate instances last year, compared to a prior record of 
100. In some 90 cases the charges led to formal prosecution which in turn have 
led to 9 convictions. LAV will use its open air event as a means to raise funds 
via the sale of traditional Easter eggs. A 9 euro donation will contribute to 
LAV??s efforts in defence of animal rights and to the farming businesses 
involved in producing raw agricultural materials used in manufacturing the 
chocolate Easter eggs under equitable commerce schemes. On joining LAV??s appeal 
subscribers can directly petition the Joint Parliamentary Justice Committee Chiefs 
in favour of the swift approval of the prevention of cruelty to animals bill 
which "despite a few setbacks
 ?? reads an association communique?? ?? is still a strong tool in 
countering abuse, abandonment and fighting bringing Italy in par with the rest of 
Europe??. The report specifies that 4,296 were subject to abuse in 2003 (61.15 pct 
of total cases of abuse), out of which 387 died; 250 cats (3.5 pct), of which 
105 died, and 2,479 other animals were equally mistreated. Total deaths due to 
abuse: 1,147 (16.32 pct). According to LAV animals are subject to all kinds 
of cruelty "indeed some forms of cruelty seem to have been picked out of a 
horror movie, some forms of abuse are akin to acts of sadism, which in turn is 
caused by intolerance, indifference, selfishness; the extent of the phenomenon is 
such that it may be rightly considered as a veritable social concern".</docText>

March 23? The name of the Earth Liberation Front used to surface only in 
connection with arson at logging or mining companies, but over the last year the 
group has increasingly claimed responsibility for firebombings at housing 
developments, car dealerships and in people's driveways. Who is this shadowy 
organization? 
What is the Earth Liberation Front? 
The FBI calls it the single greatest domestic terrorist threat, and since the 
mid-1990s the group has claimed responsibility for more than $100 million in 
damages in arson attacks on companies or projects ? and lately, vehicles ? it 
considers particularly damaging to the environment. That is the simple answer 
? but it's not so simple. 
In all of the dozens of "direct actions" that the ELF has taken 
responsibility, only a handful of people have sustained minor injuries, despite all the 
damage done to property. The vast majority of the postings on the ELF Web site 
have maintained a commitment to avoiding injury to people, citing a belief that 
all life is sacred. 
Recently some people who have claimed association with the ELF, including 
former spokesman Craig Rosebraugh, have said that violence against people may 
become necessary, but as of yet the modus operandi of people calling themselves 
members of the ELF has not changed. 
What are they after? 
The ELF is an offshoot of the group Earth First!, created when some 
environmentalists became disenchanted with what they saw as the lack of success of that 
organization and more mainstream environmental groups to have an impact on 
government, corporations and society. </docText>

Missouri City Animal Control Supervisor Juan Acevedo is pictured outside of 
the shelter with a dog he picked up. - Photo by Andrea Cashiola

When it comes time for Fort Bend families to get a pet, they will likely take 
a trip to the pet store or the Humane Society. What they may not know is that 
healthy, adoptable pets are being destroyed daily in their own cities and 
county. 
At the Missouri City animal shelter last year, out of 838 impounded animals, 
mostly dogs, only 35 were adopted. 641 animals were euthanized, and only 32 of 
these were bite cases.
Juan Acevedo, the city's animal control supervisor, says the shelter has 
eight kennels, and can hold up to 20 dogs, depending on size and breed. 
Unfortunately, he says, the difference between a city facility and a non profit shelter 
like the Humane Society is the amount of time that animals can be held. 
Acevedo says that they can only hold the animal from three to five days. "We 
do hold on to adoptable animals as long as we can, and we do our best to find 
them homes," he says, but there is a capacity issue. "We've held dogs up to 
two weeks, as long as we have room," he says.
Acevedo, who has worked for the city for 11 years and previously worked for 
the Humane Society, says that when he gets in an animal that is adoptable, he 
tries his best to find it a home. "When a cute dog comes in, I let everyone 
know about it. Almost everyone who works for the city has adopted."
But, he says, there is only so much the three animal control officers can do. 
"Healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized daily," he says.
Also, the Missouri City animal control office is covered with flyers for lost 
or missing pets. So, if they pick up somebody's animal, they will be able to 
easily contact them.
One explanation for the small number of adoptions may be the shelter's lack 
of visibility. It is located behind the Missouri City City Hall and library at 
what is currently a dead end. So, many residents just don't know about the 
shelter. 
"I have neighbors who have no idea there is a shelter in Missouri City," says 
resident Cynde Chaney. "If people knew about it, maybe there would be more 
adoptions."</docText>

Early on in Mahan's illness, one of her doctors, Peter Crino, wrote on her
chart, ''Could this be C.J.D.?'' -- by which he meant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, a fatal brain disorder often characterized by myoclonus jerks,
loss of coordination and sometimes dementia. C.J.D.
...
Unlike many diseases, C.J.D. is caused not by a virus or bacteria but by a
misformed prion (a type of protein) that no longer performs its proper
function in the body. Prions -- at least according to current scientific
thinking -- cause several other diseases, most notably bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Prion diseases are unique because of
the number of ways they can occur. They can result from a genetic mutation
that generates the harmful prion or from an infection of prions from an
outside source, most likely in meat that is consumed -- or simply by
chance: a certain number of proteins in the body just happen to lose their
shape over time and bring about the disease.

Mahan's doctors were not sure which of these versions of C.J.D. she may
have had. Her prion gene was found to be normal. And since no one was
known to have gotten mad cow disease in the United States, the possibility
of infection seemed remote. Her C.J.D. was most likely the third kind. It
had no direct cause. In medical parlance, the disease was sporadic C.J.D.

        <docText>John Ryan's announcement that he planned to buy his 
aunt's farm and build a grain storage bin was welcome news in this tiny burg 
that contains little more than a grain elevator, a church and the Walton Tap.
But instead of building the bin, Ryan immediately sold his land to 
out-of-town investors, who in turn erected a farm called Precision Pork that will 
contain up to 5,000 hogs in two long metal barns atop gaping, concrete manure pits.
The way Illinois law is written, neighbors had no real say in whether the 
facility would be approved. So they sued, an increasingly popular - and 
increasingly successful - choice in the raging battle over factory-style farms that is 
playing out across rural America.
From Alabama to Illinois, grass-roots groups have turned to the courts in an 
attempt to shut down industrial-style concentrated animal feeding operations, 
or CAFOs, or to keep them from being built. In Iowa alone, 14 lawsuits are 
pending that allege hog farms are nuisances.
"People who live in these rural communities are completely fed up," said 
Melanie Shepherdson, an expert on factory farms with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council. "When you have the state government and the federal government not 
doing anything about it, then the people who live in these communities say, `We 
don't want to deal with that, and if you're not going to clean it up, we're 
going to hire our own lawyer.'"</docText>

To Sabino Canyon-area residents who fear mountain lions roaming through their 
neighborhood, Rodney Coronado carried a simple message Friday, two days after 
his arrest on charges of disrupting a state-sanctioned lion hunt. 
"I'd say, move Downtown if you can't live peacefully with animals who have 
been here thousands of years," said Coronado, an Earth First activist who is 
charged with trespassing and entering a closed facility. "It's time for you to 
relocate, not the lions." 
He said he did not think his activities had increased the chances of a 
lion-human encounter: "I think the actions of developers and the Game and Fish 
Department will do more to destabilize lions than anything I did." And if he had 
had an encounter with a mountain lion and scaring it with shouts or stones 
hadn't worked, he would never have shot the cat even if he had had a gun - which he 
said he didn't. 
"I'm going to fight to defend myself, but if it's my time to go, it's my time 
to go," said Coronado, 37, who is part Yaqui and part Mexican-American. He 
was released from custody Thursday on his own recognizance, one day after he and 
a writer for Esquire magazine were charged with trespassing and interfering 
with the lion hunt. 
"I'd rather die in a lion attack than in a car accident, that's for sure," he 
said. "There's more dignity and honor dying in the wilderness as part of the 
food chain rather than in rush hour on Speedway." 
But while Coronado proclaimed his 10 hours of disruption a success, four 
Sabino Canyon-area residents disagreed. </docText>

        <docText>Behind the glass doors of a little gray building
tucked into the heart of Aggieland, a colorful band of postmodern Dr.
Frankensteins creates life in petri dishes.

Duane Kraemer and his crew of animal scientists at Texas A&amp;M University's
cloning laboratory have made history four times in the past five years,
turning the stuff of science fiction into a cast of lovable, man-made
animals that have captured headlines and imaginations around the world.

Dewey the deer, cc the cat, Second Chance the bull, and a dozen other
animal clones created at the Reproductive Sciences Laboratory are the
furry faces of groundbreaking research that helped science arrive at the
cloned human embryo recently announced in South Korea.
...
Although no one has ever tried to harm or set free any of the cloned
creatures, Dewey and the others live in secret locations just in case.
Animal-rights groups "have very different priorities from ours,"
Blue-McClendon said diplomatically. "Let's leave it at that."
...
Conservationists compete for funding and worry that cloning will lead to a
cavalier attitude about endangered species.

Animal-rights groups denounce cloning failures as indescribable cruelty to
animals.

Ethicists wonder whether humans will come to view animals as objects
rather than living beings.

Fears about cloning are the same ones that cropped up with each milestone
in Kraemer's career, he said. He's convinced that they'll be resolved when
the public gains a better understanding of the science.

To that end, Kraemer, a media-savvy scientist, finishes up yet another
interview with a TV reporter before driving away in his white pickup to
one of his favorite lunch spots: The Lion's Club.</docText>

LOS ANGELES - Last season, they trashed chiropractors, psychics,
survivalists, environmentalists, creationists and space-alien molestees.
This year they're setting their sights higher, ruthlessly mocking love,
safety and the Bible. And, maybe, democracy.

''I would love to do a show just called, Your Vote Doesn't Count,''
confides investigative comedian-magician Penn Jillette. ``And just go up
against Rock The Vote. But I'm sure they'll squash me on that.''
...
But, though it may get lost among the purple language and the pranks, the
bedrock of P&amp;TB is old-fashioned journalism. That's never been more
apparent than in Thursday's season premiere, a hard look at animal-rights
zealotry.

After examining tax returns of the biggest animal-rights organization,
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Penn and Teller charge that
it has funneled tens of thousands of dollars to a confessed arsonist
linked by federal investigators to at least seven firebombings of
laboratories and farms. They also accuse PETA of killing more than 1,300
animals it ''rescued'' in raids on labs and animal shelters.

(PETA officials reacted with scorn last week to advance word of the
program. ''Penn and Teller's ratings for this show are as poor as their
longstanding lack of compassion for animals,'' said PETA spokeswoman
Jennifer McClure. ``PETA is fighting violence in society with peaceful if
sometimes gimmicky means; if Penn and Teller are going to try to cut and
paste in order to come up with some other interpretation, then shame on
their animal-hating agenda.'')

Although Penn and Teller narrate the episode while munching on spare ribs
and other former animals, the animal-rights show contains less of P&amp;TB's
trademark humor than usual. That's because, Penn and Teller admit, they
were scared by their own research.

''PETA is a scary organization,'' says Teller, the single-name part of the
team -- even his passport identifies him only as Teller -- who ordinarily
is silent. (He finally speaks in this season's premiere, but, predictably,
it's a word that makes newspaper copy editors throw up.)</docText>

A few days before Christmas in 1996, Robert Grajewski saw a tiny brown animal 
sniffing around his mailbox as he pulled out of the driveway on his way to 
work. When he got home that evening a puppy, with no collar or tags, was hiding 
behind a snow shovel leaning on the front porch of his house. She was so small 
Grajewski said he could "see her head sticking out one side and her tail 
wagging on the other." It took just an open door and a kind word to get her 
inside. </docText>

When a police officer tried to ticket Richard Cryer for letting his golden 
retriever, Cody, swim unleashed at Greenwich Point during the offseason, Cryer 
produced a copy of a state statute to prove that it was legal for his dog to 
run free.

The 70-year-old retired engineer said he began carrying a copy of the law to 
the beach with him after he had to persuade a police officer not to ticket him 
last year.

"Most of the dogs that run in the water don't bother anybody," Cryer said. "I 
suppose there are a few dogs that could be trouble, but I think the dogs 
should be allowed on the beach."

Responding to increased complaints about roaming dogs, Greenwich police and 
animal control officers began issuing citations in recent weeks to dog owners 
who let their dogs off a leash at Greenwich Point, Animal Control Officer 
Allyson Halm said. But dog owners may be within their rights due to an ambiguity in 
the law.

A town ordinance imposes a $92 fine for allowing a dog to roam off a leash at 
Greenwich Point, but the state statute Cryer cited allows owners to unleash 
their dogs below the high-water mark, which is considered state property.

Connecticut law 22-364 requires dog owners to prevent their dogs from roaming 
at large on public property and says pets must be "under control" at all 
times, but it doesn't make a leash a requirement. Cryer asked the town to clarify 
the law last year, and its law department sent him a letter explaining that 
dogs are allowed to swim below the mean high-water mark, but police officers can 
ticket owners if they think the dog is behaving badly.

Dog owners protest they are following the state law, but officers often see 
dogs that appear out of control, Halm said.</docText>

"Here's where the animals are brought in," Jim Tucker says. Tucker is 
talking about horses and pointing to what looks like a garage door. This is 
the door the horses will walk through to be killed -- horses that somebody 
sold for a few hundred bucks or less: the old ones, the slow ones, the mean 
ones, the lame ones, the ugly ones. Chances are, each horse will have a 
name. Chances are, each one will have pulled a load or carried a rider or 
eaten sugar from a child's hand. But the moment it goes through this door, 
its status will plummet to mere livestock, just a cow with spirit. Then, in 
the next day or two, it will be killed and skinned and gutted, carved into 
steaks and chops, and shipped to countries across the seas where people eat 
horse meat. The slaughterhouse is in DeKalb, 60 miles west of Chicago, and 
Tucker runs the place.

Which puts him in a tough spot. "No doubt about it," he says Friday 
morning, walking through the place, giving a tour. "It's an issue with some 
people." How much of an issue? What happens when you tell people what you 
do for a living? "For every 10 people, I'd say that maybe one or two are 
amazed," Tucker replies. "They won't talk about it. Most of the rest will 
say, 'I don't think there's anything wrong with that.' And a couple will 
say, 'Good for you.'"

Cavel International, a Belgian firm, operated a slaughterhouse for horses 
in DeKalb from 1987 to 2002. Some people in town protested, but Tucker 
likes to pull out old business stories from the local papers about how 
great it was for DeKalb. When the slaughterhouse burned down in 2002, Cavel 
decided to rebuild. The new plant -- a big block of gray concrete in the 
boonies of DeKalb -- is scheduled to open in a couple of weeks. It would 
employ 30 to 40 workers and could handle the slaughter of 100 horses a day.

A bill pending in Springfield, however, would close down the slaughterhouse 
before the first horses even showed up. The bill, which would ban the 
slaughter of horses in Illinois for human consumption, was approved by the 
Senate last year. An amended bill, backed by the state's five biggest 
racetracks, could be voted on in the House as early as Thursday.

Did David Graybeard, the chimpanzee who was first observed to use a tool by 
Jane Goodall, have any idea of who he was? Do elephants, dolphins, cats, 
magpies, mice, salmon, ants or bees know who they are? Was Jethro, my late 
companion dog, a self-conscious being? Do any of these animals have a sense 
of self? What do these animals make of themselves when they look in a 
mirror, see their reflection in water, hear their own or another's song or 
howl, or smell themselves and others? Is it possible that self-awareness - 
"Wow that's me!" - is a uniquely human trait?

Because there's much interest and much exciting work to be done concerning 
what animals know about themselves, it's worth reflecting on what we do and 
don't know about animal selves. There are academic and practical reasons to 
do so.

In his book, "The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex," Charles 
Darwin pondered what animals might know about themselves. He wrote: "It may 
be freely admitted that no animal is self-conscious, if by this term it is 
implied that he reflects on such points, as whence he comes or whither he 
will go, or what is life and death, and so forth." Darwin also championed 
the notion of evolutionary continuity and believed that animals had some 
sense of self. In the same book, he wrote, "Nevertheless, the difference in 
mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one 
of degree and not of kind." Thus, there are shades of gray and not 
black-and-white differences between humans and other animals in cognitive 
abilities. So, while animals might not ponder life and death the way humans 
do, they still may have some sense of self.

After decades of studying animals ranging from coyotes, gray wolves, 
domestic dogs, and Adlie penguins and other birds, I've come to the 
conclusion that not only are some animals self-aware, but also that there 
are degrees of self-awareness. Combined with studies by my colleagues, it's 
wholly plausible to suggest that many animals have a sense of "mine-ness" 
or "body-ness." So, for example, when an experimental treatment, an object, 
or another individual affects an individual, he or she experiences that 
"something is happening to this body." Many primates relax when being 
groomed and individuals of many species actively seek pleasure and avoid 
pain. There's no need to associate "this body" with "my body" or with "me" 
(or "I"). Many animals also know the placement in space of parts of their 
body as they run, jump, perform acrobatics, or move as a coordinated 
hunting unit or flock without running into one another. They know their 
body isn't someone else's body

Consumer Alert went undercover into the Warehouse Outlet in the Quakertown 
Farmers Market -- a large grocery store that advertises low prices. They found 
low prices, but they also found a lot of expired products like a bottle of 
Kraft Catalina salad dressing, dated Oct. 24, 2003; Butterball sliced deli turkey, 
dated Feb. 12, 2004; packages of hot dogs dated from Dec. 9, 2003; and nonfat 
Kraft Miracle Whip dated March 5, 2003. 
The owner of Quakertown Warehouse Market, Richard Woldrow, said he stands by 
his products. 
"If someone doesn't want to buy a six-month-old bottle of mayonnaise which 
has an indefinite shelf life for $1, they can always buy one for $1.50 that is 
in code. It happens to be the same product -- no degradation," Woldrow said. 
Dr. Stanley Segall is a professor of food sciences at Drexel University. 
Consumer Alert asked him to take a close look at all of the items we bought. 
"You can see the beginnings of separation. This is a emulsified product. 
Yeah, you could shake it up, I suppose and it would look all right. But again, 
this a fat product, and it's not going to taste very good -- the fat goes 
rancid," Segall said. 
"Old products are only old in terms of a calendar date. The manufacturers 
don't feel them to be old," Woldrow told Consumer Alert.</docText>

        <docText>=Allegations involving animal abuse at the Riverside County-run Indio 
Animal Shelter has prompted county officials to conduct an investigation. 

Janis McLaughlin,director of the Department of Animal Services with Riverside 
County, was directed by the county supervisor?s office on Wednesday to look 
into allegations that include the beating of animals by staff.

"It will require some digging and checking around to find out what happened," 
said McLaughlin. 

She and other county officials met with Indian Wells resident Mickey 
Deckerand another concerned person in Supervisor Roy Wilson?soffice on Wednesday to 
discuss the complaints. 

The issues discussed also were included in a complaint Decker mailed Friday 
to the Riverside County Grand Jury. 

Decker alleges that the shelter?s staff abused animals while they were being 
euthanized.

"We have a girl who witnessed with her own eyes. They (animals) were beaten 
senseless while ? laying there dying," said Decker. 

She said the witness also claims to have seen newborn kittens die of exposure 
and starvation.

Decker said she has photographs documenting alleged abuses.

Denys Arcuri,legislative assistant to Wilson, said he was concerned to hear 
of the beating allegation especially because he can?t fathom that happening. 

He?s visited the shelter and said the employees do not seem like the kind of 
people who would do that. </docText>

Hunting groups this week opened their campaign to discredit a ballot
measure facing Alaskans this fall that would ban bear baiting.

They accused sponsors of the ban of failing to register with the Alaska
Public Offices Commission. It's an attempt to conceal the identity of
individuals and groups bankrolling the effort, they say, and they suspect
Outside animal-welfare groups will be revealed.

Nonsense, say ban supporters, who believe baiting is unethical and unsafe
and that allegations of Outside influence are just a tactic to deflect
public attention from the real issue. And ironically, they note, the
hunters have hired an Oregon group to run their campaign.
...
The coalition, which includes the Alaska Outdoor Council, the Safari Club
of Alaska, National Rifle Association and other like-minded groups, hired
Pac/West Communications to run its campaign. Spokesman Jerod Broadfoot
said the Wilsonville, Ore., firm "handily defeated" an attempt to ban
trapping in Oregon in 2000. Alaska faces a similar challenge, he said.

"One of our main themes is, 'Don't let out-of-state extremists come in and
manage Alaska's game,' " Broadfoot said. "We completely expect the Humane
Society of the United States to dump three-quarters of a million" dollars
in the upcoming Alaska campaign, he added.

A spokesman for the Humane Society, senior vice president Wayne Pacelle,
said his group has not yet donated to the Alaska campaign but probably will.

"We are sensitive to the inside/Outside contribution issues. We also do
have a lot of other issues that we need to fund," he said. "But we
certainly don't want to see hunting groups based in Ohio and Washington,
D.C., pour money into a campaign to preserve the unsporting, inhumane and
unnecessary practice of bear baiting, and then claim they're somehow
Alaskans. It seems to me they've lost any credibility in this argument by
having a campaign based in Oregon. It's total hypocrisy." </docText>

Volunteer firefighters at Shippensburg's Cumberland Valley Hose Company
looked beyond bingo and the community fair for their latest money maker.

They're banking on thrill of snakes. Rattlesnakes.

Fire Chief Chris Helm, a snake hunter and member of the Keystone Reptile
Club, announced the snake hunt and sacking contest on Friday -- nearly
three months ahead of the event and a couple of weeks before the state
decides whether to issue a permit for the event. 
...
Firefighters say they are expecting controversy and even welcome a visit
from animal rights activists.

Andrea Cimino, wildlife campaign manager with the Humane Society of the
United States in Washington, D.C., said society investigators have visited
snake roundups in Pennsylvania and Texas. She said she is not aware that
any Pennsylvania roundup has been the site of public protest, but the
society still worries for the snakes. 
...
Committeeman Mike Weimer said that he had preferred dead snakes to live
ones before he was dragged off to a snake hunt.

"I got to touch a snake," Weimer said. "I became more respectful and
understanding. I wouldn't have gotten that if I hadn't gone on the snake
hunt."</docText>

PASADENA -- Marvin Rudnick was pacing around a conference table at his
upstairs office on Colorado Boulevard, working himself up into indignation.

The U.S. Attorney's Office had indicated it would be seeking DNA samples
blood or saliva from Rudnick's most high- profile client, alleged
ecoterrorist Bill Cottrell, accused of spray-painting or torching more
than 100 sport utility vehicles. After playing coy about whether and when
he could disclose his letter opposing the request, Rudnick was now making
a passionate case for its newsworthiness.
...
Cottrell, a 23-year-old physics student at Caltech and an alleged member
of the Earth Liberation Front, faces 35 years to life in prison if
convicted. At a meeting with the press after Cottrell's arraignment
Monday, Mayock did most of the talking, speaking in a smooth, honeyed
voice and comparing the crime to "aggravated vandalism.'
...
 Drawing on their years of prosecutorial service, both attorneys believe
there is political pressure to get tough on "terrorism' cases. Among nine
charges of arson and conspiracy is one of using a "destructive device'
during a federal felony. That one carries a mandatory minimum of 30 years
in prison.

That sentence, Mayock points out, is several times greater than the
sentence someone would receive for firing a gun into an occupied house.

"You can politicize cases by calling it terror when it's not, and make it
look like you're doing something for the public,' Rudnick said. "I think
the Democrats would do the same thing. But would they do it to the same
level? Would it be five years instead of 30?'

"You've got an election coming up and a president who's running as someone
who handles terrorism,' Mayock said. "There's definitely gonna be a lot of
politics in this case.'</docText>

Beef, chicken, pork, veal, whatever animal stock one can think of -- it is
the staple of diets worldwide. It is also the antithesis of the diet and
lifestyle of those select few known as vegetarians.

Vegetarianism is a rapidly growing trend, especially as more information
about the effects of rendering animal products becomes available.

It is evident that several students at New Prairie High School give their
dietary decisions considerable thought.
...
Sophomore Amy Feller has been a vegetarian for nearly two years, but her
reasons for abstaining from meat differ from Hooper's. "I read some
pamphlets from PETA and decided that I didn't want to eat meat anymore
because it's cruel," she explained.
...
Caleb Jackson, a junior, is a two year veteran of vegetarianism and sees
his diet in a different light. "It's not that I don't like meat. It's that
I hate vegetables," he snarled. "I want them to be shredded to bits, then
disintegrated by my stomach acids."

Perhaps the most interesting explanation for vegetarianism comes from
science teacher Bill Spier, who has avoided meat products but not seafood
for more than 28 years. "My first reasons were stupid and immature," he
stated. "It began as an animal rights issue -- when I was young and
ignorant -- but it has since evolved into a sustainable earth issue."

Spier described sustenance as taking the world's current eating habits and
applying them to future living conditions. "By 2050 there will be nearly
12 billion people on this planet -- do you really think we can all live
off cows?" he asked. "You should be thankful that everyone doesn't eat
like an American -- otherwise we'd have nothing left."</docText>

A dark-haired girl in a Harry Potter T-shirt sits at the dinner table
staring at those around her. The two adults at the table gobble down their
chicken and beef broth while the smallest child haphazardly attempts to
place bits of hot dog in his mouth.

The girl looks upon the spectacle in disgust, wondering how they consume
the bodies of the tortured souls in such relish. She looks down at her
plate of yams, green beans and pasta, and a smile creeps across her face.

The above excerpt explains a typical meal of mine. I've been a devoted
vegetarian for more than two years now, and I could never imagine going back.

My choice to become a vegetarian was first influenced by my affinity for
animals. I didn't understand why we had to eat them when there was such a
wide variety of other food choices. I've never had a real taste for meat;
the only meats I ever really liked were my grandma's fried chicken and the
quick and easy hot dog. My fate was sealed when I became aware of where
the meat was actually coming from and the many healthy benefits of
vegetarianism.
...
Protein and vitamin B12 must be implemented into a normal eating schedule.
I find the task of eating well to be relatively easy. Just as someone on a
normal diet should eat accordingly, a vegetarian should also. The only
difference is that food choices don't include meat, so other levels of the
food pyramid are substituted.

The tallest hurdle for me to overcome is protein, but it's still not
difficult. Vegetarians can still eat dairy products, so milk and cheese
supply protein. Or if you (like myself) are pursuing veganism (consumption
of no meat or animal byproducts), soy and tofu are valuable resources.
Soymilk is actually quite tasty and shelters me from the rank taste and
smell of cow milk. Soymilk can be easily substituted into recipes calling
for cow milk without a noticeable difference. Smart dogs or veggie burgers
(both composed of soy) are wonderful for a five-minute meal.

One of the best-known names in the ongoing battle over predator control in
Alaska is Priscilla Feral, president of the Connecticut-based Friends of
Animals. Feral, who has visited Alaska 50 times over the past 25 years,
was in Anchorage last week to consult with attorneys on her group's legal
challenge to several new state-sponsored aerial wolf-kill programs, and
with her supporters and contractors.
...
Q. Do animals have rights?

A. Not under the law, they don't. But animals aren't resources like coal.
They're not plants and trees and gravel. ... We're all animals. We all
experience an interest in our future, an interest in freedom. We can have
enjoyment in our lives, and pain and suffering. Well, wolves experience
the same thing. How do you not dare to respect them, or at least try to
not interfere with their lives? The best of all rights we could extend to
wolves or bears or any other free-living animals is to be left alone.
...
Q. What do you say to the residents of villages such as Nikolai and
Takotna, where jobs are few and where predator control programs are aimed
at boosting moose stocks for subsistence hunters?

A. I don't know why people don't have jobs. I would move to where the jobs
are. Native Americans used to move around to where the food was. ... Our
campaign is not to end the shooting of moose or caribou. It's not about
that. In my heart, I would like to see an end to that. But frankly, I
don't think that we have to agree on all points. It doesn't make us wrong
about wolf control because we are a vegetarian advocacy organization or
that we oppose hunting across the board.</docText>

They came seeking justice for a nameless, unclaimed Siberian husky that died 
tied to a tree. And they brought Alyeska, Myka, Chomper and other Siberian 
huskies, both purebreds and mixed, to help make their point. 
The demonstrators also held large signs that prompted honks and supportive 
thumbs-up from people driving past the County-City Building in Tacoma on Friday.
"Brutal dog killers deserve jail," one sign read.
"Maximum sentence for maximum cruelty," declared another.
It remains to be seen whether two Wilkeson men will be convicted of felony 
animal cruelty, and how much time they might get behind bars. But on Friday, 
they were sent directly to jail after a brief court appearance.
More than 80 people demonstrated outside the courthouse where Steven Paulson 
and Troy Loney stood accused of tying a stray dog to a tree and killing it 
with a bow and arrow last month. They shot it numerous times with the same arrow, 
pulling it from the animal's body and shooting it again and again, according 
to charging papers filed in Pierce County Superior Court.
At their arraignment Friday afternoon, Loney, 18, and Paulson, 20, pleaded 
not guilty while nearly 90 solemn people watched silently through glass windows 
or waited outside in the hallway.
Defense attorney Dixie Krieg asked that Loney, wearing a gray-green suit, and 
Paulson, dressed in a black coat and jeans, be booked and released without 
bail pending a May 19 trial. Both men willingly appeared in court Friday and 
police saw no need to arrest them after the incident, she said.</docText>

Vienna - Hollywood has portrayed them as muscle-bound and handsome but
Austrian anthropologists have found evidence suggesting that Roman
gladiators were fat vegetarians who bore scant resemblance to Russel Crowe.

The scientists did tests on skeletons of two different types of gladiators
- the myrmillos and retiariae - found at the ancient site of Ephesus, near
Selsuk in Turkey.

"Tests performed on bits of bone taken from the skeletons of some 70
gladiators buried at Ephesus seem to prove that they ate mainly barley,
beans and dried fruit," said Karl Grossschmidt, a forensic doctor who took
part in the study by Austria's institute of archeology.

"This diet, which has been mentioned in the oral history, is rather sad
but it gave the gladiators a lot of strength even if it made them fat,"
said Grossschmidt who is a member of Vienna's institute of histology and
embryology.

The Austrian paleo-anthropologists relied on a method known as elementary
micro-analysis that allows scientists to determine what a human being ate
during his lifetime.
...
A balanced diet of meat and vegetables leaves equal amounts of zinc and
strontium in the cells, while a mainly vegetarian diet would leave high
levels of strontium and little zinc, Grossschmidt said.

"The bone density here was higher than usual, as is the case with modern
athletes," said Fabian Kanz from the department of analytical chemistry at
Vienna University.
...
"It seems that the gladiators tried to put on some weight before their
battles," Kanz said.

"But this does not mean that they did not work hard to lose it again once
they stepped out of the ring," he added with a smile.</docText>

Hamsters are infected with a parasite that kills hundreds of thousands of
children in South America, Africa and Asia.

Pigs get procedures that restrict the flow of blood in their heart.

Female frogs are sedated, and their oocytes - the precursors to mature
eggs - are removed. And dogs, cats and sheep are used in dozens of other
scientific experiments at the University at Buffalo, though school
officials would not talk about them.

"We couldn't do the research that we're doing without using animals in our
research, because they're a necessary component," said Philip T. LoVerde,
a UB professor of microbiology and pathology and lead investigator on the
parasite research. 
...
 "The animal welfarists have certainly done a good job of sensitizing
researchers to the needs of the animals in their care," said Frankie L.
Trull, president of the National Association for Biomedical Research,
which promotes the use of animals in studies.

Critics say those improvements aren't enough. "What I think is that all
life has some value, and it's important to see life that way," said Dr.
Naomi Pless, who teaches family medicine at the University of Rochester
and is a member of the Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine,
which opposes animal research. 
...
However, The News obtained reports that UB filed with the Department of
Agriculture in 1997 and 2001 that include totals for nonrodents. Stop
Animal Exploitation Now, based in Milford, Ohio, obtained the reports in a
Freedom of Information Act request.

The reports show that the number of dogs, primates, guinea pigs and
hamsters all sharply increased between 1997 and 2001, while the numbers of
rabbits, sheep and pigs declined. 
...
Rats and mice are the most commonly used animals in university research
now, with about 30 million of them used in research labs in this country.
Many are transgenic, or "knockout," mice, which have had a gene removed
and are worth thousands of dollars each.

Opponents of animal research say it's big business for universities and
medical centers.

There's little incentive to try alternatives such as computer modeling or
in-vitro research, which relies on human cell lines and tissue, critics say. 
...
Valerie P. Will, a former president of Animal Advocates of Western New
York, said the organization "is less active in a public sense" on animal
research, but research opponents are making effective use of the Internet.

"We are making progress, but society progresses too slowly. Unfortunately,
too slowly for the many animals who at this very moment are going insane
or suffering immense pain in their cages in our universities," Will said. </docText>

        <docText>Marion County officials, in adding teeth to the county's regulations 
governing dangerous dogs, are seeking to put the bite on irresponsible dog 
owners. 

The proposed measure drafted by the county's legal team includes get-tough 
regulations that redefine such canines and ways of handling them and grant more 
latitude to animal control officers. More importantly, the sweeping reforms 
reach deeper into the pockets of dog owners who run afoul of the measure.

Updating the county's violent dog policies became a priority following the 
fatal mauling in December of an 81-year-old Citra woman, Alice Broom. Broom bled 
to death in front of her home after being attacked by a pack of mixed-breed 
dogs that escaped a neighbor's mobile home. The neighbor, Robert Freeman, is 
charged with manslaughter; his dogs have been euthanized.

County commissioners will consider the new rules Tuesday. 

On Friday, County Administrator Pat Howard, who formed a task force to study 
the county's animal control ordinance and recommend changes, said it became 
apparent after Broom's slaying that the problem wasn't dangerous dogs. 

Instead, it was dangerous owners. And the county's method of dealing with 
them was impotent and cumbersome. 

"We had six dangerous dogs kill a person," Howard explained. "My intent was 
to tighten up some holes and get a little tougher. The idea is to get the 
attention of the owners." 

Most likely they will take notice of the newly suggested fines.</docText>

When Temple Grandin surveyed slaughterhouses in 1996, only 36% of the
plants were doing a good job shocking the animals senseless before slaughter.

Many had animals falling on slippery floors, mooing or squealing in pain,
while being repeatedly whacked with cattle prods.

Now, her system of measuring key indicators of stress and pain has
revolutionized cattle and pork processing plants, including Madison-based
Odom's Tennessee Pride Sausage, which has a slaughterhouse in Arkansas.
...
Companies such as McDonald's are counting the number of falls, the amount
of mooing and the number of animals stunned correctly, all in an attempt
to ensure a better end for the animals.

''There is no question in my mind that handling is dramatically better
compared to the 1990s,'' said Janet Riley, a senior vice president of
public affairs and professional development at the American Meat Institute.

Even animal rights groups applaud the changes.

''Just the fact that these slaughterhouses are doing audits is a big step
in the right direction,'' said Dan Shannon, a campaign coordinator for the
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which advocates diets without
meat or dairy products. ''But the audits are only eliminating the very
worst of the abuses. These animals still suffer. They're still terrified,
and they're still being abused in a number of ways.''
...
The improvements in the pork and beef industry have redirected some
attention from them to the poultry industry, which is exempt from the
humane slaughter law.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, known for its shock
campaigns, has begun a ''bloody bucket'' campaign, handing out buckets
filled with fake blood and bones to children dining in KFC restaurants.

Many more chickens, an estimated 8 billion of them this year, will be
eaten in the United States than pigs or cows, further giving reasons for
the animal-rights activists to go after the poultry industry.</docText>

As you grip the scalpel in your hand, your palms become sweaty just
thinking about what you're expected to do. Holding your breath, your hand
slits open the belly of the little frog, spilling its insides. The vile
smell nauseates you, and feelings of guilt course through your mind.

Students enrolled in Richard Horvath and John Wibbens' honors biology
courses are expected to do just that in the second semester.

The two teachers insist that dissection is required, but is it really?
Can't we learn without the unnecessary death of a frog?
...
According to the PETA Web site, frogs sold to schools for dissection
aren't always raised specifically for dissection. Even when the frogs are
raised in captivity, frogs must be captured from the wild to restock these
breeding ponds.

A completely independent frog colony has never thrived long without the
introduction of outside frogs. Stealing these frogs from their natural
habitats upsets the ecosystem. Removing the frogs also removes predators
of insects, allowing for easier insect infestations.

The PETA Web site also cites scientists in the United States who have
noted severe declines in frog populations, which they blame on the capture
of these animals for dissection and food as well as environmental problems.</docText>

other? 
It?s a balance Theresa Ink has yet to achieve.

lover. She?s also passionate about her gardens. 
Last year, she spent a considerable amount of time and money landscaping much 
of her 1?-acre property in south Fort Myers. DOGGIE DO'S &amp; DONT'S
Do: 
? Leave a couple of feet unplanted near fences, to which dogs are naturally 
attracted. 
? Keep compost piles someplace pets cannot get to. 
? Consider creating container gardens or using raised beds, both of which 
discourage digging. 
? Provide an area in which dogs may dig and praise them when they use that 
space. 
? Adjust your expectations. There will be some yellow areas in the lawn and 
the occasional foray into the garden no matter how much you try to prevent them.
 
? Be extra careful with water gardens or ponds. Pets are curious and might 
fall in. Either place a fence around it or make sure there are steps or a 
shallow area that make it easier for the animal to get out. 
Don?t: 
? Punish a pet for misbehavior unless you catch it in the act. 
? Weed in view of a dog. Weeding creates new scents that dogs find 
irresistible. 
? Install new plants in the presence of a dog. Seeing you digging is apt to 
inspire it to do the same.</docText>

PCRM LAUNCHES NATIONAL CAMPAIGN CALLING FOR END TO AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY 
"CATTLE BARONS' BALL" EVENTS

Washington - The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) is 
calling on the American Cancer Society to put an end to its "Cattle Barons' 
Ball" events - beef-themed fundraisers promoting the very disease the 
cancer research and prevention giant is committed to curing. The 
fundraisers feature Western and cowboy themes, including "chuck wagons" 
loaded with beef and other meats. More than 30 are held each year, mostly 
in the South and Southwest, almost two-thirds of them in Texas and Florida.

PCRM Nutrition Director Amy Joy Lanou, Ph.D., has written to the local 
organizers of the ACS-sponsored Cattle Barons events across the country 
urging them to either cancel or find new themes. As part of its campaign - 
"Cancer: It's What's for Dinner at the Cattle Barons' Ball" - PCRM has 
launched a nationwide e-mail write-in effort calling on American Cancer 
Society CEO John Seffrin, Ph.D. and ACS chapters to call off or re-theme 
these events. An e-mail "postcard" can be sent to Dr. Seffrin by going to 
PCRM's Web site www.AmericanCancerSocietyPromotesDisease.org/letter.html  
Dates and full contact information on all upcoming Cattle Barons' Ball 
events are here as well.

"It is irresponsible of the American Cancer Society to sponsor events that 
promote beef consumption," said Lanou. "For more than 20 years, major 
scientific studies have linked beef and other meats with increased risk of 
cancer, particularly colorectal cancers."

More information on the link between cancer and meat consumption, PCRM's 
e-mail "postcard" urging the American Cancer Society to cancel or re-theme 
its Cattle Barons' Balls, and the dates, locations, and contact information 
on all upcoming Cattle Barons' Ball events can be found on PCRM's Web site: 
www.AmericanCancerSocietyPromotesDisease.org.

NEW MAD COW REGULATIONS STILL MAKE US MAD
In response to the discovery of the first case of Mad Cow Disease in the
U.S. last December, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced
it will increase testing of the nation's cattle up to 480,000 cows per
year. Consumer groups, including the Organic Consumers Association and
the Consumers Union, say these new projections for testing are
completely inadequate, given that the U.S. Cattle industry slaughters 35
million animals annually. The government and large beef corporations
fear more tests since they know Mad Cow disease has now spread to more
and more cattle in North America. However, many ranchers in Kansas,
California, and other states, desperate to regain their export markets,
say they're willing to test all cows, as Japan and other nations have
demanded. http://www.organicconsumers.org/madcow/nytimes032204.cfm

---------------------------------

EARTH FRIENDLY LABELING LIES
Consumers are quickly learning that government oversight of product
labeling is all too loosely regulated. To add to the already existing
confusion, the Hudson Institute's Center for Global Food Issues (CGFI),
an agribusiness and biotech front group, has announced it will now be
labeling qualifying products as "Earth Friendly". This designation will
be placed on genetically engineered foods and factory farmed meat and
dairy products.. The corporate-funded CGFI claim they have a right to
label products as such, given their "scientific" opinion that certain
aspects of GE crops and densely packed feedlots are better for the
environment than organic agriculture.
http://www.organicconsumers.org/organic/labels031904.cfm

---------------------------------

SCARY FISH FACTS
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released new safety guidelines
for fish consumption, due to ever-increasing levels of mercury
contamination. The fish containing the highest levels of mercury are:
shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish. The guidelines suggest
eating up to two meals a week (totaling 12 ounces) of fish that are low
in mercury such as shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock and
catfish.
http://www.organicconsumers.org/foodsafety/fish032204.cfm

---------------------------------

GETTING JUNK FOOD OUT OF SCHOOLS
With the Bush Administration's reduced funding for education, many
school districts have been forced to seek other sources of income,
including widespread installation of junk-food vending machines. School
districts can make up to $100,000 per year under these contracts, but as
a result of increased access to unhealthy foods, the childhood obesity
and diabetes epidemics are on the increase. In response, two dozen
states are now considering banning junk food vending machines in
schools. The National Soft Drink Association is contesting this ban,
claiming that high levels of junk food consumption are okay, and placing
the blame on schools for not teaching the kids to exercise more.
http://www.organicconsumers.org/school/obesity031904.cfm

---------------------------------

REGULATING ROCKET FUEL LEVELS IN WATER
California has become the first state to consider regulating the levels
of allowable toxic perchlorates in drinking water. The pollutant has
been found in increasing levels in waterways around the U.S.,
particularly in areas near military bases and test sites (the toxin is
most commonly originates in rocket fuels). Perchlorates cause severe
neurological and thyroid dysfunction and are currently unregulated. In
related news, the U.S. Department of Defense is insisting to Congress it
should not be forced to comply with any environmental regulations, as a
matter of national security.

U.S. practices.
The tour of the Pedercini International pig farm in Porzano di Leno was part 
of the annual county president?s incentive trip to learn about international 
agriculture. The farm is a research center for new products and technologies, 
including farrowing and gestation equipment, flooring system and slats, and 
weaning and finishing pens.
The farm?s four confinement buildings, housing about 2,000 sows, were 
constructed of concrete with both natural and forced-air ventilation. 
Inside, Pedercini has developed a patented Freesow gestation stall for sows 
and gilts to be held in groups according to new European Union regulations on 
animal welfare. After pregnancy detection, the crate can be raised to group 
four sows to a pen for 110 days. The animals are moved back to standard crates 
for farrowing.

        <docText>Two strangers wandered into the 
Stevensville tavern and the conversation turned to hunting and fishing - not 
unusual in any Montana bar. They asked about one bar regular, a local named Ben 
Ruiz.

Before long, Ruiz approached the pair and said he could not only arrange a 
hunting or fishing trip, but could get one of the men, from Iowa, an illegal 
Montana-resident hunting license - for a price. 
What Ruiz didn't know was the two strangers were undercover state game 
wardens investigating reports that Ruiz, not a licensed outfitter, was arranging 
illegal hunts.

The case of Ruiz, who was later convicted or pleaded guilty to seven 
misdemeanor violations, is just one example of what is considered a troubling trend in 
Montana: people taking cash to help others poach.

Poaching is hardly a new phenomenon in Montana, and the majority of cases 
still involve people illegally killing animals for their own use.

The most common citations remain hunting or fishing without a license or 
hunting on private property without permission.

But wildlife officials say that over the past decade, they have seen an 
increasing number of cases in which money - sometimes thousands of dollars - is 
exchanged to arrange illegal hunts.

''People are willing to pay large amounts of money to kill a trophy animal 
and don't care if it's illegal or not,'' said Jim Kropp, chief of law 
enforcement for the state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

Kropp said it's difficult to provide accurate figures on how big an increase 
there has been in illegal hunts. But he said it has been steady enough that 
illegal paid hunts have become a major focus for game wardens.</docText>

The General Assembly finds that the numbers of unwanted cats and dogs in 
North Carolina has reached crisis level. Unwanted animals frequently become strays 
and suffer from a lack of food, shelter and veterinary care. In addition to 
these humane concerns, stray animals are a public nuisance and present a 
serious public health problem as many are not vaccinated against rabies. In 2001, 
over 227,778 cats and dogs were turned into shelters or picked up by local 
animal control authorities and euthanized. Unwanted animals also create a 
substantial financial burden for the counties and municipalities that must collect, 
house, and ultimately euthanize the animals. Limited financial resources have 
made it difficult for local governments to provide adequate animal shelter 
facilities.
The General Assembly finds that existing State and local animal welfare 
programs have not been effective in either stabilizing or reducing the numbers of 
unwanted companion animals in the State. Factors affecting the increase in 
unwanted animals include the State's population growth and the inadequate funding 
of State and local animal welfare programs. The General Assembly finds, 
however, that the primary cause of the increase in unwanted animals is uncontrolled 
breeding. Lack of education regarding the reasons to spay or neuter an animal 
and the lack of financial resources on the part of many of the citizens of the 
State contributes to the problem of uncontrolled breeding. The General 
Assembly finds that many county and city animal welfare programs and nonprofit 
humane societies have implemented programs that have greatly increased the numbers 
of homeless pets adopted, Adoption alone, however, is not adequate to 
significantly decrease the number of animals being destroyed. The General Assembly 
finds that the most viable solution to the pet overpopulation problem in this 
State is increase the availability of low cost spay and neuter services. It is 
the intention of the General Assembly to establish a companion animal program 
that will provide financial assistance to local governments for low-cost spay 
and neuter services, adequate sheltering facilities, and other services for 
companion animals.</docText>

        <docText>A group opposed to government efforts to manage bison 
wandering from Yellowstone National Park has accused federal, state and county 
officials of a concerted effort to undermine its work by repeatedly violating 
members' constitutional rights. 
In a federal lawsuit filed in Missoula, the Buffalo Field Campaign claimed 
authorities engaged in "an escalating and systematic pattern and practice of 
assaults, harassment, spying, intimidation, slander, false arrest and 
detentions." 
The alleged actions of officers working for the U.S. Forest Service, Montana 
Department of Livestock and Gallatin County sheriff's office occurred without 
legal justification, the complaint said. 
Lorette Ray, spokeswoman for Gallatin National Forest; Karen Cooper, public 
information officer for the state livestock agency; and Marty Lambert, Gallatin 
County attorney, declined to comment Monday. All said they had not yet seen 
the suit, which was filed March 3. 
The complaint, which is before U.S. Magistrate Leif Erickson, asks for a 
total of $950,000 in damages from various individuals and the county, in addition 
to attorney fees. 
The suits lists 16 alleged incidents, with most of the confrontations between 
officers and group members occurring during 2001 and 2002. The events 
involved times when members were watching and sometimes videotaping government agents 
hazing, capturing or shipping to slaughter bison that migrate from the park 
in search of winter forage. </docText>

Amidst the turmoil caused by Tuesday?s column ?Meat should not be pushed
out of diets? there has been a certain level of unchecked
anger regarding the perception entertained by some concerning meatless
diets. Truly, a reasonable mind must admit that vegetarianism is a life
choice that should be left to the individual, and barring extremism or
irresponsible management, is perfectly healthy. But there is a certain
faction within the vegetarian community, specifically those motivated by
animal rights, which would take a position of similar extremism to
Tuesday?s column.

Underlying the Tuesday column?s theme is a legitimate concern for
omnivorous individuals. The fact is, while most vegetarians would leave
the world to eat meat as they please, there is a certain number that would
strike it from menus world wide. 
...
In particular, this right is challenged by groups such as People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, and contemporaries who often militantly
lobby against the meat industry. PETA?s mission statement submits that
?animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on or use for
entertainment.? It is at this point that the very arguments present on
today?s page countering the April 6 column turn against PETA members and
supporters. Vegetarianism should not be forced upon meat eaters, and until
PETA and similar groups amend their campaign goals to allow for the meat
industry to continue operation, anyone who enjoys a burger is justified in
maintaining legitimate concerns about the vegetarian and vegan movement.
...
This does not imply that all vegans or vegetarians are blood crazed animal
rights activists, nor that they would impose their lifestyle on the
typical chicken loving consumer. But it is an aspect of the lifestyle that
should be considered by those who ascribe to it when they wonder about
their public image, and it is a feature of the lifestyle that anyone who
does not pursue vegetarianism must be aware of.</docText>

Bounty can mean "plentiful" or "that which is freely given," as well as 
referring to the price on the head of an animal. Related to other upbeat words such 
as "bountiful," way back when it came to us from the Latin word "bonitas," 
which meant "goodness" or "kindness." All true, but if you were a coyote in 
southeast Ohio these days, the word's origins might seem a little ironic.

The coyote, or Canis latrans, also has been called "God's dog." 
Native-American cultures have long revered him as a form of "the Trickster." Tricksters are 
common throughout the world's mythologies. They are spiritual beings who are 
at once sacred and profane, often using practical jokes to teach us simple 
folk a few needed lessons in common sense and humility.

Coyotes are good-sized critters, smaller than wolves, bigger than foxes. They 
are omnivores and will truly eat almost anything. When they hunt, they do not 
hunt in packs like wolves, but instead will often shoot themselves out of 
giant slingshots to catch wily prey. (OK, that part is not really true.)

The coyote population has been growing in the East and Midwest for years now. 
On average, the Eastern ones are a bit bigger than their Western kin. Most 
wildlife biologists think that they have slowly been expanding their range 
eastward ever since we started converting the Appalachian forests to fields over 
200 years ago. Others think they have been here all along, albeit in smaller 
numbers. However long they've been here, they play an important role now, and 
probably help Ohio farmers more than they'd ever hurt them, by keeping rodent and 
rabbit populations under control.</docText>

In his quest to make Montgomery County the no-kill capital of Texas and 
eradicate pet overpopulation, animal advocate Bruce Dailey is seeking help. 
 
Dailey recently formed NYPS (Neuter Your Pet Inc.), a spay/neuter nonprofit 
organization. He is searching for an experienced veterinarian, volunteers to 
distribute fliers and more animal-loving individuals to fill the board of 
directors.
Located on the corner of Texas 105 and Old Highway 105 in Cut and Shoot, NYPS 
will offer low-cost or free spay/neuter services in an effort to control the 
pet population and as an alternative to the "catch and kill" procedure 
outlined in the Montgomery County Animal Ordinance.
Owners who allow their pets to frequently propagate, laws that don't strictly 
enforce registration or mandatory neutering contribute to the crisis, Dailey 
said.
The surplus animals are routinely destroyed simply because they exist. The 
Montgomery County Animal Ordinance allows destruction of animals several days 
after being captured. There were 496 dogs and 155 cats euthanized in January, 
and 444 dogs and 219 cats in February.
"Out of 10,485 animals that were killed last year alone, if you took those 
poor animals and stretched them out two feet apart down the road, it would 
stretch out four miles," said Dailey, who turned 83 Monday. "Four miles of dead 
cats and dogs just last year. This is what NYPS is trying to do: We're trying to 
reverse that. Instead of catching and killing nine, we want to catch and 
neuter nine."
Getting information out to the public is one of the top priorities -- and 
biggest hurdles. Roughly 30,000 fliers need to be distributed countywide, and 
Dailey urges any prospective volunteers to contact NYPS at (936) 264-2323 and 
leave a message.
Finding an experienced vet and getting the equipment needed is another 
stumbling block. He did not receive any response to a recent ad requesting a 
veterinarian.</docText>

Debra Gurley does not want the circus to come to Los Alamos next week
because she alleges that circus animals are abused.

The Carson &amp; Barnes Five Ring Circus is being brought to town by the Los
Alamos Chamber of Commerce.

"I think there are just too many checks and balances for the Carson &amp;
Barnes Circus to abuse their animals," said Sue Hofmann, executive
director of the Los Alamos Chamber of Commerce said. "They cross so many
state lines and are inspected by so many agencies on a continual basis.
How could they possibly stay in business for 68 years if they mistreated
the very animals they rely on for their livelihood?"

Gurley disagrees.

"I will have to boycott any of our local businesses who support this by
selling tickets, provide advertising, or sponsorship. I will encourage
others to do the same," Gurley wrote in an e-mail to local businesses
forwarded to the Monitor on Saturday. 
...
"Once advertising starts appearing about the Carson &amp; Barnes Circus coming
to town, animal rights (activists) sometimes begin a campaign of
intimidation based on half-truths, misinformation and lies," said Alfrieda
Wilkins, a Carson &amp; Barnes spokesperson.
...
Jim Rogers, a spokesperson for the United States Department of Agriculture
in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C., said Carson &amp; Barnes
Circus has never been charged with a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
...
Rogers can be contacted at 202-690-4755 or jim.d.rogers@aphis.usda.gov.
...
The Monitor received a copy of one of those tapes.

PETA alleged in the tape that, "A Carson &amp; Barnes animal care director was
videotaped viciously attacking elephants with a bull hook, shocking
elephants with an electric prod, and instructing trainers to embed hooks
into the elephants flesh."</docText>

        <docText>Wilbur was savaged by a dog. Petey didn't eat much because of 
his overbite. Noah had kidney stones. Chief was going to be stuffed.
As Debra White strolls through the wooded 10 acres of her Winslow Farm, she 
tells the stories of each of the animals that waddle, lumber and trot up to 
greet her, sniff her hands, and nibble at the drawstrings of her jacket.
"They're my children," she says, as she stands in a pen inhabited by horses, 
llamas, emus and other creatures she's rescued from neglect, or worse.
Winslow Farm is nestled among colonial and split-level ranch homes, on a side 
street where trucks roar past the parking lot. But stepping through the 
handmade gate, visitors enter a seemingly enchanted world among the oaks and pines.


On the other side of the fence, soothing music is piped through hidden 
speakers, and the smell of burning sage fills the air from a fire pit. Stone statues 
peek out from under bushes, and birdhouses await springtime visitors.
But the most startling element of Winslow Farm is its inhabitants.
Cats mill underfoot, scamper up fence posts and skulk across the rooftops of 
buildings. Emus pick through leaves. Sheep and pigs loll side-by-side. 
Peacocks rattle their tailfeathers. Goats and ponies wander up to sniff visitors. The 
sound of crowing, clucking and honking animals fills the air.
"I've been blessed enough to be given this opportunity. I suppose I could 
have sold the land and had a good amount of money come in, and maybe traveled or 
something, but my mission is to do a good thing," White said.
White, 51, grew up on the property next to the farm. Her father was a 
mechanical engineer, but was so debilitated by Parkinson's disease that White says 
she served as his hands, learning how to build the things that he couldn't.
She inherited the 10 acres where she now lives from her grandparents, and 
planned since she was young to start a refuge for animals on the property. She 
worked three different jobs for 17 years to save enough to start the farm.

The widely held notion that Canada is taking excellent care of its wild, 
pristine lands ? far better than the gluttonous citizens in the United States ? 
is nothing more than a misperception approaching myth. Americans, or Yanks as 
they are often called up north, are frequently verbally assailed by Canadians 
with the misplaced and perhaps na?ve notion that all U.S. citizens are swine 
when it comes to caring for and preserving quality country.

Canadians, in contrast, are valiant, conscientious souls who have no blood on 
their hands. This stance is at best spurious and possibly created to hide the 
fact that the western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest 
Territories, and the Yukon are being plundered at an astonishing rate.

While I was having a couple of drinks in a bar called The Pit in Dawson City, 
Yukon, last summer, a Canadian came up to me and asked where I was from. When 
I told him he said, "You damn Yanks don't give a damn about your own land. 
You log it and stripmine it all to hell. Then you come up here to enjoy our 
country." Over the years I've heard many comments along those lines.
 
True, there are individuals in Canada who have devoted their lives to 
preserving the land and there are, as most of us know all too well, greedy people 
tearing apart the last remaining shreds of unspoiled country in the United 
States. But fair is fair, and the bottom line is that Canadians should take stock of 
their own environmental situation before gleefully casting aspersions 
America's way.

Forty years of being an inveterate road bum, traveling back roads on a skinny 
budget, fishing malarial bogs, inadvertently canoeing class V whitewater, 
hiking nonexistent trails bound for nowhere, and unavoidably staying on top of 
environmental issues in Canada has provided me an ongoing opportunity to see 
disturbing change in a land of incredible splendor and abundance ? one peopled 
with some truly remarkable, generous, and creative individuals. But in the last 
five years, these destructive shifts in direction have been seismic, both 
metaphorically and literally.

Land Under Siege

The notion that Canada is the great white sustainable north is not wholly 
without merit. On the Environmental Sustainability Index, developed by Columbia 
and Yale Universities, Canada is ranked fourth and the United States 45th. 
Canada allows industrial hemp production, while the United States prohibits it, 
and is also a signatory to the U.S.-shunned Kyoto Treaty on global warming.

But when it comes to allowing extractive industries to run rampant, Canada 
may be king. From Fort Nelson in northern British Columbia to Rocky Mountain 
House in central Alberta to the vast Tintina Trench region in the southern Yukon 
and over east to Yellowknife on Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, 
the landscape is under siege. The extraction industries are running the show, 
tearing, blasting, sucking, and cutting every diamond, gold nugget, drop of 
oil, chunk of coal, and stick of timber they can access. If it's of value, 
these industries intend to have it.

What's going down in western Canada puts the devastation being visited on 
states like Montana, Wyoming, and West Virginia look mild by comparison. What are 
obviously horrendous clearcuts or devastating open-pit coalmines in the U.S. 
West are everyday situations in Canada too. Both countries are mining their 
natural resources at an alarming rate.

Canadian provincial campgrounds are filled to the brim with late-model 
pickups tricked out with all the options and pulling expensive fifth wheelers and 
pricey speedboats, ATVs, and jet skis. The Cypress Hills section along the 
Alberta-Saskatchewan border, the setting for Wallace Stegner's book Wolf Willow, 
are now so overrun as to resemble a scene from National Lampoon's Vacation. 
Housing developments in cities such as Calgary and Edmonton stretch for miles with 
thousands of quarter-million-dollar homes. 

All of this comes not only from the jobs provided by these corporations but 
also from royalties paid by the industry based on the amount of a given mineral 
extracted from a province. In Alberta, this figure exceeds $6 billion 
annually just for coal. The money is flowing in direct proportion to the abundance of 
the oil coming from countless wells hammered into the Canadian countryside. 
The old phrase "a chicken in every pot" has been updated in the northland to 
"an oil pumpjack in every yard."</docText>

The bullfighting season has kicked off, but the end of the "Corrida" could be 
nearer than many think. This week, Barcelona became the first city in Spain 
to officially oppose the bloody sport. But no ban is in sight.

As recently as January, bullfighting in Spain was the subject of an academic 
honor when the University of Cordoba in southern Spain begin offering a degree 
program in the artistry-filled sport. But not everyone in the country shared 
the city's enthusiasm for the sport: This week, politicians in Barcelona 
brandished their own capotes and swords, and took aim at bullfighting, a popular, 
albeit bloody, national pastime.
With a vote of 21-15 and two abstentions, Barcelona's city council voted on 
Tuesday following a heated debate in support of a non-binding resolution that, 
although stopping short of banning the fights, condemns bullfights and defines 
cattle as beings that are "sensitive both mentally and physically." 
With the resolution, Spain's second-largest city after Madrid has declared 
itself an "anti-bullfighting city." The vote angered fans of the centuries-old 
tradition, while drawing praise from animal rights activists, who declared it 
the "beginning of the end of this bloody spectacle."
Heated debate
The city council of Barcelona itself does not have the authority to ban 
bullfighting -- such a move would require a change of the laws of the Catalonian 
government and a vote in the regional parliament. But the vote does carry strong 
symbolic weight because Catalonia is ruled by the same socialist party as 
Barcelona. The city's socialist mayor said he was convinced that "bullfighting 
will disappear in the longterm."
Tensions threatened to boil over at many points in the debate over the 
resolution. "Bullfighting is a celebration of our culture that has been denigrated 
by the Germans and the Anglo-Saxons," sighed Javier Basso, a member of the city 
council and the conservative People's Party (PP) of outgoing Prime Minister 
Jos? Mar?a Aznar. He described bullfighting as a "noble dance between bull and 
man." Editorialists at many Spanish newspapers criticized the vote, saying it 
evoked the time of dictator rule under Franco. Members of the People's Party 
said they would oppose any ban, and the Socialist Party remains divided over 
the resolution. The issue became so heated that the vote was held secretly.

        <docText>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the

Whether it is deer in Montana, black bears in New Jersey, mountain lions in 
California or bison in Wyoming, wildlife is becoming accustomed to city life, 
sometimes with tragic results. 
In Helena, Montana, up to 500 mule deer live within the city limits, and 
their number is growing. 
"We have 25-50 fawns born each year," said Mike Korn, the area supervisor for 
Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
Development and urban sprawl are partly to blame. 
"We've actually moved into their territory, rather than vice versa," said Ron 
Aasheim, administrator of conservation education for the department. 
Drought conditions and wildfires in the last five years are other factors. 
"In some areas, towns and cities are the only green spots," Korn said. 
Environmental laws have sometimes been too effective. New Jersey's black 
bears were hunted nearly to extinction before a 33-year hunting ban led to a 
population explosion. 
In Montana, mule deer numbers are growing in its cities as the urban 
environment provides ideal habitat. 
"Food, shelter, lack of predators -- the deer have everything they need," 
Aasheim said. 
Last month, northern California officials were shocked to find a sea lion in 
a farmer's field about 65 miles inland. The 315-pound creature had traveled 
about 1 mile from the nearest body of water, a series of canals crisscrossing 
the farmland. </docText>

A pet psychic has been called into the case of Shadow, the Lincoln-area dog 
dragged behind an all-terrain vehicle and burned with cigarettes late last 
month. The dog survived and is recuperating from her injuries. 
Meanwhile, the reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in 
the animal-abuse case was raised to $10,000 Friday, with the Humane Society of 
the United States pitching in an additional $2,500 toward the steadily 
growing fund. 
"That'll buy somebody a new car," said animal lover Crystal Shear, of near 
Milton. 
Shear has followed Shadow's story in the news and contacted pet psychic Diane 
Roadcap to see whether the psychic could help. Roadcap lives in Springfield, 
Va., but also has a summer house in Lewes and has given psychic readings at 
animal-related events in the area. 
"I know some people who would say, 'Yeah, right,' " Shear said of the 
psychic. "But it's amazing the things she tells you that she couldn't have known." 
Shear said she contacted Rob Wolhar's family, who adopted Shadow from the 
Milton Animal Rescue League, to suggest they send a photo of the dog to Roadcap 
so she could work with the image to help determine who abused their pet. 
"We're curious what will come of it. It's worth a try," said Angela 
Frabizzio, Wolhar's fianc?e, who has heard from Roadcap with a message. 
"She gave us a call yesterday and said she had a feeling it was somebody 
between the ages of 14 and 17," said Frabizzio, alluding to the animal abuser. </docText>

April 19 issue - Before getting his big idea, William von Hippel sat through 
an otherwise unexceptional lecture on traditional Chinese medicine in 1997. As 
China adopts Western habits?sedentary jobs, stressful urban lives, poor diets?
its citizens are also picking up Western afflictions. Cases of impotence are 
on the rise, and so is the demand for traditional cures like seal penises, sea 
horses, geckos and other exotic ingredients that many Chinese believe confer 
virility. The problem: the growing demand for these ingredients is driving 
many species of wildlife to the brink of extinction. Von Hippel, a psychologist 
at the University of New South Wales in Australia, was intrigued enough to 
visit apothecaries in Hong Kong and Beijing, where he saw a bewildering array of 
dried penises in all shapes and sizes. Then, in 1998, Viagra made its debut in 
the West.

Later that year, while von Hippel was hiking near Anchorage with his brother 
Frank, a biologist at the University of Alaska, the siblings decided to write 
a letter to the journal Science, proposing that this pill, at $10 a pop, could 
quell demand for "animal sexual potency products" and prove a boon not only 
for Chinese men but for endangered species. To their surprise, Science 
published the letter even though "we had no data," says William. When the brothers 
followed up with studies, they found a decline in the poaching of Canadian seals 
and Alaskan reindeer (killed for their antlers, a traditional Chinese cure) 
that they attributed partly to Viagra. If Viagra caught on among Asians, they 
argued, it could be an effective conservation solution.</docText>

Gardeners have had it with the deer. George Hughes, who lives outside
Annapolis, Md., has watched bucks use their antlers to lift the cages off
his tomatoes and sample the juicy Big Boys. They also mowed down 1,000
junipers he had planted at his tree farm in Easton, Md.

He had been told deer don't eat junipers. "Well, they don't like juniper,
but if they get a bad enough winter, they'll eat anything," he said.

So he rallied his fellow homeowners in Saefern, a community of 105 homes
on 250 acres, to bring the hunters in. He found a group of Vietnam
veterans who are ace bowhunters. They killed 15 deer in Saefern last
hunting season. "And they're going to do the same this year," Hughes said. 
...
Hunting seasons have been extended, and states like Pennsylvania, Maryland
and New Jersey have encouraged hunters to shoot does instead of bucks. But
even sharpshooters do not usually enter densely packed neighborhoods to
hunt deer. All those fertilized suburban lawns, luscious azaleas and
kitchen gardens packed with sweet corn have bolstered deer populations.
...
Animal rights activists, like Nancy Bowman, the president of the Mercer
County Deer Alliance, a coalition with 1,500 members, voiced their outrage
and filed lawsuits.

"It's morally and ethically bankrupt," Bowman said this week. "And it's
not necessary." Bowman says that deer are not destroying the habitat. 
...
Animal rights groups say there are other ways to protect the gardens. "We
suggested relocating the deer and doing a contraception program," said
Stephanie Boyles, a wildlife biologist for PETA, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. "Killing the ones inside doesn't solve the problem,
because more will just move in to take their place."

By lengthening the hunting season and encouraging more doe hunting,
Maryland now kills about 100,000 deer a year, but that has only stabilized
the deer population. Managed hunts reduce deer in the immediate vicinity,
but the problem continues to grow as suburbs expand. </docText>

o outsiders, animal rights advocates look to be a strange lot. We don?t eat 
meat, avoid cosmetics tested on animals and boycott the Ringling Brothers 
Circus. Drape ourselves in fur? Forget it. Animal rights advocates don?t even wear 
leather or wool
Many people view advocates as certifiable, grade-A, top-of-the-class 
nutcases. Reduced to the essentials, however, what we believe is just common sense. 
We believe the animals killed for food, trapped for fur, used in laboratories 
or trained to jump through hoops are unique somebodies ? not generic 
somethings. What happens to them matters to them. What happens to them makes a 
difference to the quality and duration of their lives. 
In these respects, animal rights advocates believe humans and these animals 
are the same ? equal. And so it is that all advocates share a common moral 
outlook: We should not do to them what we would not have done to us. Not eat them. 
Not wear them. Not experiment on them. Not train them to jump through hoops. ?
Not larger cages,? we say, ?empty cages.? 
?Humane treatment? 
Comparatively speaking, few people are animal rights advocates. Why? Part of 
the answer concerns our disparate beliefs about how often animals are treated 
badly. Animal rights advocates believe this is a tragedy of incalculable 
proportions. Nonadvocates believe mistreatment occurs hardly at all. 
That nonadvocates think this way seems eminently reasonable. After all, we 
have laws governing how animals may be treated and a cadre of government 
inspectors who make sure these laws are obeyed. 
In the language of our most important federal legislation ? the Animal 
Welfare Act ? animals must receive ?humane care and treatment.? In other words, 
animals must be treated with sympathy, kindness, mercy and compassion ? the very 
meaning of the word ?humane.? It says so in any standard dictionary. 
For fiscal year 2001, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
conducted 12,000 inspections. Of that total, only 140 sites were reported for possible 
violations because of improper handling of animals. That works out to a 
compliance rate of almost 99 percent. 
Inspections and myth 
Tragically, the public?s trust in the adequacy of government inspections is 
misplaced. What inspection service inspectors count as ?humane? undermines the 
inspections before they are conducted.</docText>

FOR hundreds of millions of years, the remnants of dead animals and plants 
have been accumulating on the bottom of the earth's oceans. In some areas the 
stuff was absorbed into porous rock formations, cooked by the earth's core and 
transformed into the substance called oil. There it sat until 1859, when a 
former railroad conductor drilled the world's first oil well near Titusville, 
Pennsylvania. Since then, 50,000 more have been drilled, and the substance has 
transformed human civilization. 
But we're running out. Of the 2 trillion readily extractable barrels of oil 
that once lay under the earth's surface, humans have managed to find, pump and 
burn nearly a trillion. At current rates, Caltech physics professor David 
Goodstein argues in "Out Of Gas," we've only got enough to last till 2043 or so. 
Even according to the rosier estimates favored by some scientists, the end of 
the line will come before the end of this century. 
Of course, doomsayers made similar warnings during the oil shocks of the 
'70s, and their predictions were falsified when new discoveries outpaced usage. 
But things are different now, argues Goodstein. Working from calculations by 
geophysicist M. King Hubbert, he shows that oil production typically follows a 
bell-shaped pattern. In America, for instance, new discoveries led to a 
production surge in the early 20th century. But output peaked in 1970 - as Hubbert 
predicted 14 years earlier - and has been declining ever since. 
According to Goodstein's analysis, this bell-shaped pattern is now playing 
out internationally. New discoveries have been flat in recent years. And the 
author believes the world will likely hit the top of its production curve - the 
"Hubbert peak" - sometime in the next decade. 
After that, output will fall, even as demand from industrializing nations 
such as China skyrockets. In response to price shocks, many consumers will switch 
to natural gas. But that will provide only temporary relief: The Hubbert peak 
for gas is itself only a few decades away.

"Commercial hunting of baby seals is back and even bigger than when it
stirred a global outcry two decades ago.

"Horrified by the clubbing of infant harp seals, animal rights advocates
swayed public opinion against the hunt. Environmentalists joined the
campaign, fearing that the species was being depleted. World sales
collapsed. Even Canada reacted with revulsion and began stiffening
regulations on the kill.

"Now, Canada has lifted the quota to a rate unheard of in a half century,
buoyed by new markets in Russia and Poland, and changing environmental
calculations. A recovering market has turned into a quiet boom.

"Here on ice patches of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the hunt looks nearly as
brutal as ever. For as far as the eye can see, dozens of burly men bearing
clubs roam the ice in snowmobiles and spiked boots in search of silvery
young harp seals. With one or two blows to the head, they crush the skulls,
sometimes leaving the young animals in convulsions. The men drag the bodies
to waiting fishing vessels or skin them on the spot, leaving a crisscross 
of
bloody trails on the slowly melting ice."

We learn that animal rights campaigns in the 1970's and 1980's shut down
American and European markets and forced a virtual collapse of the hunt,
"But over the last six years, Canada's seal hunt, by far the world's 
largest
and commercially most valuable, has undergone a gradual revival that has
virtually escaped world attention. That trend is making an extraordinary
jump this year, when the federal government will allow the killing of up to
350,000 baby harp seals, or more than one in three of all those born,
largely for their valuable fur.
That is an increase of more than 100,000 from recent years, and the largest
number hunted in at least a half century."

Abolitionists, who oppose welfare reforms, arguing that they stand in the
way of the ultimate goal of animal liberation,  might be buoyed by this
line:

  "Meanwhile, tougher hunting rules, including stiffer regulations to avert
skinning the seals alive, have muted the effort to stop the hunt and eased
the consciences of Canadians."

And there is more information suggesting that calling for an end of what
seems to be the most egregious cruelty may not have a positive impact on 
the
overall suffering:

"Embarrassed by all the publicity accusing Canada of inhumane treatment of
animals, the government banned killing whitecoats -- the youngest pups up 
to
12 days old. Now only the seals who have shed their white coats and become
"beaters," at about three weeks old, are killed in these waters for their
black-spotted silvery fur. The killing of those young seals has so far
raised fewer hackles, although critics say hunting methods have not been
substantially changed."

We learn that seal products remain banned in the United States but that
there are new markets in Eastern Europe and China.

        <docText>A swath of abandoned cropland surrounded by freeways and
freight tracks would seem an unlikely place to breed exotic monkeys, let
alone unravel a medical mystery. But 20 years ago, researchers here at the
California National Primate Research Center were the first to realize that
an infection killing their colony of rhesus macaque monkeys mirrored the
new human disorder known as AIDS.

The discovery was hailed as a research milestone. And it touched off a
demand for rhesus monkeys that has continued to this day, as scientists
turn to them to study SARS, Ebola and biochemical threats like anthrax and
ricin.

But the supply is no longer keeping pace with the demand. A ban on
exporting monkeys from India, widespread destruction of their habitat in
other countries, and inadequate breeding efforts in the United States have
kept the numbers down. Today, scientists say, a severe shortage of
research monkeys is threatening medical progress.

"Requests for rhesus monkeys have far outstripped supply for the last five
to six years," said Dr. Nicholas Lerche, associate director of the
California center, one of eight primate centers supported by the National
Institutes of Health. "AIDS was the first wake-up call. Biodefense
research is going to further the demand."
...
On a recent afternoon here, Dr. Lerche strolled the back lot of what he
calls the monkey farm. Roughly half of the Davis monkeys live outdoors in
half-acre corrals with swings, sun decks, toys and shiny mirrors to keep
them amused.

Animal rights advocates paint a much darker picture, arguing that many
animals are put through needless suffering and that enforcement of the
federal Animal Welfare Act, intended to protect animals from inhumane
treatment, is lax. The primate centers reply that labs are accredited and
built to legal standards, that they are subject to unannounced inspections
and that veterinarians are on site to treat the animals.

The habitat renovation at Davis will add seven corrals at a cost of
$100,000 each, expanding the capacity to 5,000. The project will take two
years, Dr. Lerche said, but in the end Davis will be able to breed enough
monkeys to share with other centers.

Still, officials do not know how many monkeys it will take to meet the
demand. The Animal Welfare Act, import regulations and federal laws
regulating medical research allow the government to track the animals used
in public research. But pharmaceutical and biotech companies, most of them
with in-house monkey colonies, are not required to share information.

Visitors to the Carson &amp; Barnes 5-Ring Circus got an unexpected sight at the 
gate Monday night ? a woman pretending to use a bull hook to beat her 
daughter, who was dressed up as a circus elephant. Three other women held protest 
signs. 
?Until animal acts are out of circuses the violence will not stop,? protest 
organizer and Clovis resident Christina Dryden said. ?Any circus that has 
animal acts presents animal cruelty. The animals are held captive, forced to do 
shows. That is not what elephants are supposed to be doing.? 
Riene Wyatt, the mother with the bull hook, objected to the training methods 
used in circuses. 
?The means they use to train these animals are horrific,? Wyatt said. ?
Bullhooks, blowtorches and worse.? 
The circus held two shows in Clovis Monday night. The circus will have shows 
in Las Vegas, N.M., tonight. 
Joe Frisco III, a third-generation elephant trainer with the circus, said the 
protesters don?t know what they?re talking about because they haven?t worked 
with the animals. 
?You?re not going to get a 10,000-pound animal to do anything it doesn?t 
want to do,? Frisco said. ?Animals at this circus come first. In the wild every 
day they are hunted for their trunks, killed because the population is too big 
and there is no room for them.? 
Dryden, who said she is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals, said they received a mixed reaction from circus patrons as they passed out 
literature to people entering the gates. </docText>

A potential settlement in a legal battle over foie gras production could
mean some trespassing allegations are dropped from a suit against animal
rights activists who say the delicacy is made by torturing ducks, one of
the defendants said Tuesday.

In return, the activists would drop the owner of Sonoma Foie Gras and his
wife as defendants in a separate animal cruelty suit.

No settlement has been reached, and attorneys on either side of the
dueling lawsuits -- which have pitted vegan activists against Sonoma
restaurateur Guillermo Gonzalez, who runs one of two foie gras farms in
the country -- would say little, citing the ongoing discussions.

But Bryan Pease, one of several activists who have acknowledged repeatedly
breaking into Gonzalez's Sonoma Foie Gras' farm in San Joaquin County last
year, said the settlement would mean the trespass allegations against him
and his co-defendants would be dropped.</docText>

        <docText> Consider the pig. The animal's intelligence and cleanliness are
often ? wrongfully ? maligned. And most people think it makes a better
pork roast than pet.

Judy Woods considers the pig. She considers its well-being and health, and
she worries that fate is seldom kind to the barnyard mainstay.

She also considers pigs friends.

Woods runs the 34-acre Pigs Peace Sanctuary, the only such sanctuary in
the state. There's one other pig sanctuary in West Virginia and maybe less
than a half-dozen in the nation, by her estimation.

Woods calls the 90 or so pigs at the sanctuary by name. They walk up to
her, and she scratches their ears. 
...
Such enlightenment is a key part of the sanctuary theme. There's an
education center, where visitors are taught about pigs, vegetarianism and
facets of animal existence.</docText>

It wasn't just that Edward Baker allegedly bashed the cat in the face. Or 
that he chased it around the blood-spattered laundry room. Or that he 
extinguished cigarettes on another cat's paws. 
It was, authorities said, that he acted methodically, intentionally. 
That's why the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is putting 
national focus on the Macomb County case, said Daniel Paden, a cruelty caseworker 
with the animal rights organization. 
"These malicious, deliberate acts -- these acts don't bode well for the 
future," Paden said. 
Paden recently wrote Macomb County Prosecutor Carl Marlinga, urging him to 
"vigorously prosecute" Baker of Clinton Township by demanding jail time and 
psychiatric counseling. 
Paden said the Norfolk, Va., organization sees hundreds of cases a week in 
which people mistreat or kill animals. 
But the organization only writes about 10 letters a week demanding that 
prosecutors act. </docText>

Agricultural Research Service scientists in Fargo, North Dakota, have 
developed two new methods of detecting ractopamine hydrochloride, a feed additive 
given to pigs and cows so they'll produce leaner cuts of meat. 
 
Use of the methods by livestock producers, meat inspectors, or export 
companies, for example, should provide greater flexibility in where, when, and how 
they measure ractopamine residues in animals. Such monitoring helps the U.S. 
meat industry safeguard against illicit use or accidental exposure. It also 
ensures good trade relations with the European Union, which disallows animal growth 
promoters like ractopamine and other beta-adrenergic agonists. So say Weilin 
Shelver, a chemist, and David Smith, an animal physiologist, in the Animal 
Metabolism-Agricultural Chemicals Research Unit of ARS's Red River Valley 
Agricultural Research Center in Fargo. 
 
Their first method is an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the 
second is an optical biosensor. Both use a specialized type of protein called a 
monoclonal antibody. The scientists developed this antibody using modern 
biotechnology techniques. Both methods are fast, easy to use, specific, and 
sensitive, and they give similar measurements, notes Shelver. "The major difference 
is in how they make the measurements," she adds. "An advantage of the 
biosensor is that it sometimes gives less interference, or background noise, from the 
other materials in the sample."
 
In the United States, ractopamine has been approved for use in pigs since 
2001 and cattle since 2003. Ractopamine use leads to leaner, more efficient 
animals that reach their market weights sooner than untreated animals. With such 
gains, however, is the potential for illicit use in animals?such as fish, goats, 
and sheep?for which ractopamine approval hasn't been granted by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. </docText>

Joe Tedesco likes watching the wildlife outside his Dishman Hills home.

Tedesco feeds the deer at several backyard feeders, even keeping the water 
trough heated in the winter to prevent it from freezing.

Though he doesn't name the deer, he has come to recognize each one. So when 
a large buck suddenly disappeared, Tedesco decided to investigate. And what 
he found angered him.

One of his neighbor's relatives had killed the buck with a bow and arrow. 
And though the rocky land j
ust west of the Spokane Valley city limits is a no-shooting area, the hunt 
was legal.

"They're quite tame, like pets, and come around every day," Tedesco said. 
"You can stand within 20 feet of these animals. They'll look at you while 
they wait for you to put the feed out."

But while firing guns and rifles is banned in no-shooting areas in 
unincorporated Spokane County, archery is allowed. Archery is prohibited in 
the county's more densely populated incorporated areas.

And because the buck was taken during the proper hunting season last fall, 
with the proper permits and on Tedesco's neighbor's property, no law was 
broken.

Tedesco, a hunter himself, said he would never shoot a deer near a feeder.

"You can feed them and shoot them at the feeder, which shouldn't be. It's 
not a fair chase," he said. "It's like shooting your dog."

Neighbor Tom Rockroth doesn't understand what the fuss is about.</docText>

The International Fund for Animal Welfare says the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans has failed to monitor widespread violations of rules designed to 
ensure that the East Coast harp-seal hunt is conducted as humanely as possible.
The group videotaped dozens of what it said were sloppy and needlessly cruel 
killings in late March on ice floes north of Prince Edward Island and said 
there was no visible enforcement action by federal wildlife officers.
Federal marine-mammal hunting regulations require sealers to kill the animals 
quickly to minimize their suffering.
"I saw conscious seals dragged across the ice with boat hooks," Rebecca 
Aldworth, a spokeswoman for the group, said. She also said she observed sealers 
stockpiling critically injured, but still conscious seals for more than an hour 
before skinning them, and animals being skinned alive.
The group showed graphic video images of the suffering animals at a news 
conference yesterday in Toronto. Ms. Aldworth said she personally witnessed 
"hundreds of violations" while observing the hunt for 12 days in late March.
A spokesman for the Fisheries Department said its enforcement officers 
haven't laid any charges this year, although there are investigations into hunting 
in restricted areas "I would disagree with her assertion that we are not taking 
this seriously and we are not enforcing the regulations," Steve Outhouse, a 
spokesman for the department, said.</docText>

Chimps fashion stalks and twigs to get inside termite mounds
It would seem young female chimpanzees take their studies a little more 
seriously than their male classmates, a study in the journal Nature has shown. 
Females learn from their mothers how to gather termites much faster than 
males - who prefer to spend more of their time playing, US scientists say. 
Elizabeth Lonsdorf and colleagues conducted their research on wild chimps in 
Tanzania's Gombe National Park. 
They say the gender differences are similar to those seen in young humans. 
Girls and boys pick up fine motor skills such as writing at different rates, 
and the team suggests its research could therefore indicate that sex-based 
learning differences may have an ancient origin. 
Educationalists trying to develop learning strategies for children could find 
the work instructive, the scientists believe. 
"This finding is a heads-up to researchers studying the learning of 
relatively complex skills that they should take sex into account," said Dr Lonsdorf, 
the director of field conservation at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.</docText>

Cougar hunting with dogs will be permitted this year in Okanogan County and 
four other counties under a three-year pilot project recently passed by the 
state legislature.

The new law calls for participating counties and state wildlife officials to 
work together to develop a program that allows the pursuit and hunting of 
cougars using dogs. Based on their recommendations, the state Fish and 
Wildlife Commission is expected to establish the rules for the hunting 
season in August.

The use of dogs to hunt cougars, bears and bobcats has been banned 
throughout Washington since 1996, when voters approved an initiative that 
eliminated the longstanding tradition of hound hunting. Since then, the use 
of dogs has been permitted only when a particular cougar is deemed to pose a 
threat to people or animals.

Senate Bill 6118, signed into law by the governor on March 31, establishes a 
pilot cougar hunting program in Okanogan, Ferry, Stevens, Pend Oreille and 
Chelan counties. The program&#x2019;s primary goals, according to legislators and 
agency biologists, are to provide for public safety, to protect property and 
to assess cougar populations and help develop future cougar management 
plans.

Rich Beausoleil, a bear and cougar specialist for the Washington Fish and 
Wildlife Department, said the agency will begin meeting soon with county 
officials to come up with recommendations for the way the hunt will be 
structured, including the length of the hunting season and the number of 
cougars that can be killed.

"We&#x2019;re going to have some boundaries because of the biology of the species," 
Beausoleil said. "We&#x2019;re looking at the density of mountain lion 
populations."

Joel Kretz, a rancher who lives near Wauconda, was among the sportsmen and 
ranchers who have lobbied the legislature to reinstitute hound hunting. He 
served on a task force created in 2001, when Okanogan County commissioners 
determined that cougars were causing problems for livestock and residents in 
the county.</docText>

I have been reviewing the pro and con arguments on SB1921 the bill that would ban horse \
slaughter plants in Illinois for the 
purposes of producing horse meat for human consumption. 
I've learned that there are just three of these plants still operating in the 
United States. Two in Texas are in danger of closure because they are 
operating in defiance of state law as currently established. And the third, Cavel 
International in DeKalb, burned to the ground but has been rebuilt and wants to 
reopen its operations. 
Let's start with an important premise. The consumption of horse meat by 
humans is illegal in the United States. The horse is considered a companion animal, 
like a dog or a cat, and therefore, cannot be eaten on United States soil by 
anyone for any purpose. So why are there any horse slaughtering plants in the 
U.S. that produce horse meat for human consumption? 
There is a market in Japan and Europe, so the slaughter plants here export 
the meat. One advantage to exporting horse meat, rather than beef, is that the 
tariffs run approximately four times less. Since there are willing buyers, why 
not allow a business to operate that meets individual wants?</docText>

It's a scene that's hard to believe, and Ford Motor Co. says it didn't
want anyone to see it in the first place:

A small black car is parked in a suburban British driveway, accompanied by
the sound of birds chirping. A ginger-colored cat wanders up, and the
car's sunroof suddenly slides open. The cat climbs up the hood and
windshield to investigate, pokes its head into the sunroof . . . and the
sunroof draws shut, slowly beheading the cat.

The tagline says, "Ford Sportka, The Ka's evil twin."

The 40-second video is an Internet-only advertisement for a small Ford
hatchback sold in Britain. Except that Ford has disowned the ad, claiming
that it rejected the spot as too extreme and did not approve its release.

How the video wound up e-mailed around the world over the past few days is
something of a mystery. Animal rights advocates in the United Kingdom have
condemned it in the British press, and Ford's ad agency -- Ogilvy &amp; Mather
-- is conducting an internal investigation to figure out what happened. </docText>

Warm sunshine, happy students, and good music: when all of these converge
with some well-cooked cheeseburgers and hot dogs, you have the newly
formed Meat Club.

The brainchild of Dan Holtzman ?06 and Doug Bernstein ?06, the Meat Club
intends to provide students with a social event on normally quiet, lazy
Sunday afternoons. Holtzman had been in a meat club in high school and
always barbecued with friends in college. He and Bernstein had the idea to
expand their private gatherings to an event open to the entire campus as a
way to both meet new people and get the school to pay for their food. 
...
However, the path was not yet clear. Some vegetarians and vegans were
offended by the slogans on some of the club?s posters. Of particular
concern was the phrase, ?Vegetables are condiments. Eat meat.? The poster
also contained an image indicating disfavor towards broccoli. Vegetarian
Gustavo Maximo ?07 said that because of the advertisements, ?I thought the
club would be more actively anti-vegetarian.? Holtzman even received an
angry e-mail from one vegan student.

Holtzman wishes to dispel these myths. ?We are not forcing [the meat] on
anyone,? he claims. He personally does not support the idea of
vegetarianism, but respects people?s right to that lifestyle. ?In my
opinion,? he says, ?vegetarians are only living half a life. We?re simply
providing the other half.? </docText>

Charles Patterson, author of Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals
and the Holocaust, spoke yesterday at Goldwin Smith Kaufman Auditorium
concerning his book and the contemporary attitudes towards the treatment
of animals.

In an event sponsored by the Cornell Coalition for Animal Defense,
Patterson drew a parallel between the treatment of Jewish prisoners
throughout the Holocaust and the domestication and treatment of animals.
Patterson argued that the degrading means by which people treat animals is
carried over in the practices implemented in human persecution, as seen in
the Holocaust.

Patterson's thesis of his book and lecture is that the way people deal
with animals has colored and shaped how we treat each other. "The way you
treat animals in the backyard permeates your attitude and how you treat
other human beings in the front yard," said Patterson. 
...
Patterson shrugged off objections to his cause saying that anything
involving animal defense and the Holocaust would be controversial.
Instead, Patterson promoted the advancement of animal rights and a
decrease in the slaughtering of animals. In addition, Patterson is an
advocate of organic farming and the adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet.

Regarding the current treatment of animals, Patterson quoted the view held
by scholar Theodore Adorno, saying, "Auschwitz begins wherever someone
looks at a slaughterhouse and thinks: they're only animals." </docText>

        <docText>Proposed rules giving ranchers far more flexibility to kill 
problem wolves still don't go far enough, angry ranchers and landowners told 
federal officials here Thursday night.

Although new rules under consideration would let ranchers kill any wolf 
spotted near livestock, several people said that wasn't enough. And several 
ranchers said the federal government should start killing wolves because the 
predators are overpopulated and constantly attacking livestock.


 

"The landowners need to be able to kill a wolf whenever they see it," 
Paradise Valley rancher and outfitter Randy Petrich said.

A standing-room-only crowd of more than 50 people packed the meeting at the 
city-county building, which was put on by Montana Sen. Conrad Burns. Ed Bangs, 
wolf recovery leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was joined by 
Clint Riley, special assistant to the director of the service.

A Park County sheriff's deputy sat off to the side of the room, a testament 
to the chilly atmosphere toward federal officials. Bangs was called a liar 
several times, and Lenny Gregorey, a former Livingston city commissioner, called 
Bangs "Frankenstein" and said he had "screwed" all the ranchers in the room.</docText>

THE Welshman who campaigned for two decades to bring an end to the culling of 
baby seals in Canada has spoken of his anguish over the resumption of the 
slaughter
In the 1980s, millions of people around the world responded to Brian Davies' 
appeal, which was illustrated with an emotive picture of a hunter dragging a 
fluffy seal pup over white ice and leaving a red trail of blood.
Killing white seals remains banned, largely as a result of Mr Davies's 
campaign, but now Canada is embarking on a mass culling of young seals which have 
just shed their white fur.
"I'm deeply disappointed," said Mr Davies, who grew up in Tonyrefail, Rhondda 
Cynon Taff, and now lives in Florida. "It took 19 years to stop the 
white-coat hunt. I think I will be dead before this one is stopped.



"It hurts me personally, but for about 13 years there was relative peace on 
ice, so I look back on that.
"We know that during those 13 years about 1.3 million seals weren't killed 
that otherwise would have been killed, so I'm glad I did what I did.
"Before the white-coat ban, when we went to the ice to film, we couldn't get 
near the adult seals. They would slip into the water.
"After seven or eight years, we started to see dramatic change because we had 
females giving birth who had never experienced a hunt.
"You could walk among them. They didn't slip into the water to get away from 
you. They would give birth with people watching. That's all been cast out. Go 
there now and you will have just terrified animals."</docText>

John Burton Wade won't be going back to Mary Washington College this fall.

A judge this week ruled that the freshman can take his exams and finish
the school year--but then it's straight to federal prison.

Wade, 19, of Henrico County, will serve a three-year sentence for his role
in at least 10 environmental terrorist attacks in suburban Richmond in the
summer and fall of 2002.
...
Wade, along with co-conspirators Adam Blackwell and Aaron Linus, left
notes at the scenes of the attacks, claiming they acted on behalf of the
radical environmental group Earth Liberation Front.

But Wade says he wasn't motivated by ELF and doesn't consider himself a
member.

"Writing that at the scene was a convenient way to get our point across,"
he said.

Instead, he says he was inspired by Edward Abbey, author of "The Monkey
Wrench Gang," a book about four nature lovers who wage war on developers.

"It's basically a handbook for environmental terrorism," Wade said.</docText>

A trip to Seal Island off Hout Bay has become one of the top attractions in 
the Western Cape but the boat-loads of tourists who make the journey are seldom 
given the true story behind these animals.

Like how many die from being entangled in fishing nets, or how many wash up 
in the harbour after starving to death, or how many are shot by fishermen who 
see them as vermin.

Hout Bay "seal man" Francois Hugo is putting together an awareness campaign 
comprising billboards of photographs, information boards and a booklet to 
educate people about these seals which have become a huge money-spinner for a 
number of Seal Island tour-boat operators.

Some of the pictures show the horrors of what the seals endure, like one 
yearling which beached on a tyre in the harbour, close to death from starvation.


'At least four seals die every day'
It was very weak but this didn't stop some men setting their dogs on the 
young seal.

In front of a jeering, applauding audience, the dog grabbed the seal around 
its snout and inflicted some horrible injuries before Hugo was called. The seal 
died on the way to the vet.

He says he wants people to become aware of these types of mindless attacks so 
they can be stopped.</docText>

  A Vet has branded a savage attack in which a puppy suffered 35-degree burns 
as one of the worst he has seen for nine years.

The most appalling act of deliberately burning an animal I have seen since 
being a vet Tim Argent, who works at Vets4Pets in Scartho, was appalled by the 
deliberate act of cruelty against eight-month-old mongrel Mollie.

It is thought that boiling water was thrown over her, after she escaped from 
her loving family home in Danesfield Avenue, Waltham.

News of the attack comes a month after a Grimsby man was convicted of a 
vicious hedgehog attack - and days after RSPCA officers warned they were struggling 
to cope with the rise in acts of cruelty.

Scalding water covered most of Mollie's body and has killed her nerves, 
meaning she cannot feel any pain from her wounds - something experts see as a 
blessing in disguise.

Mr Argent said: "This is the most appalling act of deliberately burning an 
animal I have seen since becoming a vet nine years ago.

"At first we were not sure what was wrong with Mollie, but after shaving off 
her fur we could see that she had been very badly burnt.

"Someone has definitely thrown hot water over her because you can see the 
drip marks on her legs and stomach.

"It is lucky the attack was so severe and destroyed her nerve endings because 
she can no longer feel any pain."</docText>

You know our messy living space of a planet isn't in great shape when Alanna 
Mitchell, a sharp-eyed Globe and Mail journalist raised by an equally 
sharp-eyed field biologist, travels toward the world's most abused landscapes with one 
big awful question on her mind: "Are humans a suicidal species?"
Fortunately, no weary ecologist or shell-shocked biologist actually answers 
with a "yes." Most reply that life is an uncertain business at best. And one or 
two add that our species is not immune to extinctions or wholesale ignorance.
But the good news in Dancing at the Dead Sea, a riveting tale of land and 
water abuse, is that there doesn't appear to be anything hard-wired about the 
species that makes us playful death-seekers or Sylvia Plath wannabes. Although we 
can be as lethal as smallpox, we do have the ability to think in the long 
term. The bad news is that thinking hurts a lot and hasn't become a visible 
evolutionary habit yet.
But the consequences of its absence can be frightful to behold. And that's 
what Mitchell starkly underscores in this beautifully written collection of 
essays about some of the world's most degraded real estate. Whether describing the 
wholesale looting of Madagascar's hardwood forests (another Haiti) or the 
calculated theft of groundwater in Jordan, Mitchell makes it pretty plain that 
not a lot of thinking of any kind is going on these days.
In fact, Mitchell compares our emotional coolness toward climate change (and 
other unglad tidings) to the frigid reception that greeted Charles Darwin's 
theory of evolution. The Victorians just couldn't accept the earth-shattering 
idea of successful and not so successful creatures because it challenged their 
central belief that everything had been fixed in its place.
Mitchell now argues that we've essentially entered Darwin round two. "Homo 
sapiens, too, has a shelf life," she warns. "And rather than trying to prolong 
it, our actions as a species are aimed at shortening it." Although the world's 
fisheries, primates, tropical forests and ice caps appear to be headed for 
hell in a handbasket, our happy species remains economically fixed on the idea of 
easy wealth and endless rows of SUVs.</docText>

        <docText>The film image shows a hulking seal 
hunter walking across the ice in pursuit of a baby seal as it wobbles to escape. 
The hunter stomps on the seal's tail, raises his hakapik -- a spiked club -- 
and bangs the baby seal on the head, once, twice, until the animal lies still. 
The hunter turns the club, hooks the seal's silvery head and drags it away, 
leaving a line of bright red blood in the snow. 




The camera cuts to a seal appearing to gasp for air, blood running from its 
nose as it lies on an ice floe. Not far away, a sealer sharpens his knife 
blade. The seal seems to be thrashing as its fur is sliced from its torso. Behind 
it, a pile of carcasses rises, bloodied seals without their fur, black eyes 
like marbles without lids, left behind in the Atlantic sun. 
"This hunt is back, and bigger and crueler than ever," said Rebecca Aldworth, 
a spokeswoman for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which filmed the 
seal hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in March. She said the images are proof 
that this year's seal hunt in Canada was the most brutal the world has seen 
in three decades. 
"I witnessed the terrible cruelty and almost no government monitoring for the 
hunt," Aldworth said in an interview. "Just meters from me, seals were sliced 
open as they struggled, showing signs of conscious response to pain. I 
noticed several seals still alive. They were breathing and flippers still moving. An 
injured seal lifted her head and cried at us. Blood was coming from her mouth 
and nose, and she was making horrible sounds. She was trying to crawl, 
clearly in agony." </docText>

As fears of mad cow disease rippled across the country three months ago,
the nation's top health official announced stringent rules preventing
farmers from giving cows potentially high-risk feed, saying Americans must
"never be satisfied with the status quo."

But, in fact, the status quo remains.

Despite the urgent tone of that January announcement, the proposed rules
have yet to go into effect, and farmers can use the risky feed with impunity.

Instead, a series of bureaucratic complications and scientific questions
-- prompted by complaints from industry groups and outside safety experts
-- arose within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Review committees
were formed, and they continue to work on issues such as how to dispose of
the prohibited feed.

To become enforceable, the rules must be published in the Federal
Register, a daily compendium of federal government actions. Federal health
officials in January said that would happen in a matter of days. But, to
date, they have not appeared.</docText>

Pets being used as tool to keep members in line

There is a growing body of evidence linking animal abuse and family
violence, and those who take care of the victims of both say they believe
that learning more about that connection will prompt more people to take
notice and take action.

The Coastal Women's Shelter and the Colonial Capital Humane Society have
aligned themselves with a national initiative, "Animal Cruelty IS Family
Violence," launched by the Humane Society of the United States to raise
awareness of the connection during 2004 Animal Cruelty/Human Violence
Awareness Week, which begins today.

PALM BEACH -- TJ and Neil Fisher hired an ex-CIA agent and offered $10,000
to find the person who's shooting and killing cats with a high-powered
pellet gun.

But that's not enough in the pricey neighborhood on the 100 block of
Seminole Avenue, where mansions go for millions. Now, the couple has upped
the offer to $25,000.

They hope someone will offer information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the person who pumped three pellets into Karuki, the
one-eyed orange tomcat the Fishers adopted last year.

Flint -- If you pass up a fast food hamburger, the processing energy you
save would equal about 20 miles worth of fuel for a car and water for 17
showers, environmentalists say.

Raising animals for food requires more than one-third of all raw materials
and fossil fuels used in the United States, say animal rights activists.

That's one of the reasons Meriam Corcoran has been a vegan, a vegetarian
who uses no products derived from animals, for 13 years.

Corcoran is a founding member of Veggies In Motion, a metro Detroit group
seeking to spread news about the benefits of plant-based nutrition.

Controversial cultural event will benefit Portuguese religious organization 
in Salinas

It's either a cruel example of "ritualized mock violence" or a celebration of 
a great cultural heritage.
However it's described, a bloodless bullfight is scheduled for the Salinas 
Sports Complex next month, the first such production in Monterey County.
Sports Complex officials say they expect a big crowd for the June 13 event, a 
benefit for a Portuguese religious organization.
"For years, people have been asking about bullfights," said Sally Hamana, 
spokeswoman for the California Rodeo, which operates the Sports Complex. "There 
is a lot of pageantry involved. It's very festive and very fun."
That's not how Gary Tiscornia would describe it. He is executive director of 
the Monterey County SPCA.
"If you look at it, it's ritualized mock violence that can only be done here 
in California under the aegis of a religious organization," Tiscornia said. 
"We believe in celebrating the multiculturally rich society. But traditions 
change with the times. A bloodless bullfight is not worthy of today's moral 
considerations."
Traditional bullfighting -- the ones that ultimately result in the death of 
bulls -- are illegal in the United States, though the sport remains popular in 
other countries, including Mexico, Portugal and Spain.
Even the bloodless bullfights were not allowed in California until state law 
was changed recently. The law allows bloodless bullfights as long as they are 
staged in conjunction with a religious celebration.
The matadors and bandarilheiros do not use sharp blades during the bloodless 
bullfights, instead employing blunted velcro-covered instruments.

        <docText>When the nation's largest circus rolls into the state
capital at the end of the month with its gigantic Asian elephants in tow,
it will be met with a proposed law seeking to regulate the treatment of
elephants in captivity.

Elephants displayed at circuses, petting zoos, carnivals and parades are
currently subject to federal and state animal welfare rules. Some New York
lawmakers want to go a step further by strengthening state regulations
specific to elephants and imposing punishment on animal handlers and
others who violate the law.

The bill before the state Legislature would require that elephants
transported into New York be kept in temperature-controlled, ventilated
trailers. It also mandates that elephants have their legs unchained for at
least an hour a day excluding the time that the animal is on display.
...
Last year, the Maine Legislature passed a compromise law requiring state
agricultural officials to adopt rules consistent with federal standards on
the treatment and care of circus elephants. Some lawmakers initially
favored banning circuses and traveling shows in Maine because they felt
the animals were abused in captivity.</docText>

Do you own your pet? Guard it? Or simply keep it company? 
Such is the question Jon Katz blasted as ridiculous in an article he wrote 
last month. The author of "The New Work of Dogs: Tending to Love, Life and 
Family," Katz says making a fuss about what people call themselves in relation to 
their pets -- owners, guardians, or companions -- is futile. 
Katz wrote the article (see full text at www.slate.msn.com/ id/2096577/) in 
response to a letter he received from In Defense of Animals, a California-based 
animal rights organization. The letter requested that in his future books, 
Katz refer to people as "guardians" rather than "owners" of their pets. 
Founded by a veterinarian, Dr. Elliot Katz, no relation to Jon Katz, in 1983, 
IDA describes itself as "an international animal protection organization 
dedicated to ending the exploitation and abuse of animals by raising the status of 
animals beyond that of mere property, and by defending their rights, welfare 
and habitat." 
Dr. Katz, who leads the fight against laboratory testing, neglectful puppy 
mills and other cruel treatment of animals, believes changing how we speak will 
change how we act.

Meat,? Tuesday, April 20, from 5-7 p.m. in the Memorial Union Building?s
Theater I on the campus of the University of New Hampshire. Her
presentation is free and open to the public, and a reception and book
signing will follow.

Adams? multimedia presentation will explore the link between the
objectification of women and animals in the modern media. She will provide
an ecofeminist analysis of the interconnected oppressions of sexism,
racism and speciesism by exploring the way popular culture presents images
of race, gender and species. The presentation also will suggest forms of
resistance against the construction of individuals, human or nonhuman, as
?meat.? </docText>

 Criminal trespassing charges have been filed against a federal 
wolf recovery official and another man who were found with four wolves on a 
private ranch.

The men may have inadvertently landed their helicopter on private land Feb. 
14 to place radio tracking collars on four wolves that had been tranquilized, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have said.

Park County Attorney Bryan Skoric said biologist Michael Jimenez of the Fish 
and Wildlife Service and Wesley Livingston of Hawkins and Powers Aviation, 
each faced two counts: trespassing and placing or depositing objects upon the 
property of another, "more commonly known as littering," according to a statement 
released through his office.

Both are misdemeanor counts that carry maximum penalties of up to $750 in 
fines and up to six months in jail, he said.
The statement did not specify what items were considered to be litter.

Jimenez, wolf recovery project leader for Wyoming, did not immediately return 
a telephone call seeking comment Friday.

The Little Red Tractor logo is the sign of a voluntary quality assurance 
scheme developed by the National Farmers Union and now run by Assured Food 
Standards. It was launched in 2000 to help restore public confidence in the farming 
industry after a series of food scares. The scheme is an umbrella term which 
unites a variety of quality assurance schemes developed for specific branches of 
farming with a set of common minimum standards. There are additional 
standards for abbatoirs, processing units and hauliers. The scheme now covers between 
65 per cent and 90 per cent of output in the main commodities. The Red Tractor 
symbol claims to be evidence that farmers "are practising high standards of 
animal welfare, food safety and environmental practices". However, an 
investigation carried out by animal rights organisation Compassion in World Farming 
(CIWF) claims that the Little Red Tractor logo "offers few assurances that 
animals are treated any better than the bare minimum legal guidelines". Under the 
scheme, practises such as the intensive rearing of broiler chickens, the use of 
narrow farrowing crates for breeding pigs, the use of battery cages for laying 
hens and animal mutations such as the debeaking of chickens and the tail 
docking of pigs are still permitted. CIWF claims that the Red Tractor scheme is 
"more concerned with creating the image of welfare rather than the reality". The 
logo is also not a guarantee that the product is British. It can be used on 
produce which comes from other countries as long as the producers comply with 
the necessary standards. 

FREEDOM FOOD 

This farm-assurance scheme, administered by the RSPCA, was set up in 1994. 
Like the Red Tractor, it is a voluntary scheme which farms, hauliers and 
abbatoirs can apply to join, and covers eggs, meat and dairy products. It implements 
RSPCA species-specific welfare standards based on the "five freedoms" defined 
by the Farm Animal Welfare Council: freedom from fear and distress; freedom 
from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and 
disease; freedom to express normal behaviour. Businesses are admitted to the 
scheme only when an approved assessor has carried out a detailed audit. Spot 
checks are also carried out. Before the logo can be applied, all stages of a food?
s production, eg farm, haulier and abattoir, must be accredited. However, the 
Freedom Food logo does not mean that the food is free-range. The RSPCA will 
accredit indoor systems of animal rearing provided the animal has plenty of 
room to move around and good access to food and water.

We are writing to ask for your help on one or more of three important 
mercury-in-seafood/sea turtle-related matters.  The first is a request 
that you send a letter to the editor of your local paper (there is a 
sample below) about the FDA?s latest mercury-in-seafood advisory. The FDA 
has just issued an advisory that will threaten children and families from 
mercury.  Let the papers know what you think about the FDA playing 
politics with public health.

The second is that you print out a ?Got Mercury?? PDF document and post 
one or more of them on bulletin boards in your community (caf??s, grocery 
stores or other community bulletin boards).  The document can be 
downloaded from:
http://www.seaturtles.org/pdf/mercurytearoffsign3.pdf
or by visiting www.seaturtles.org and clicking the mercury, swordfish and 
sea turtle campaign link on the home page.  The website www.gotmercury.org 
allows seafood consumers to determine how much seafood is safe to eat, in 
complete contradiction to the FDA?s advisory.

And the third, in case you haven?t already done so, is to visit 
www.seaturtles.org home page and send a letter to Safeway asking them to 
warn customers in all of their stores about the dangers of mercury in 
seafood, not just California stores.  Safeway must not continue to ignore 
the public health threats posed by mercury in seafood!

Every time we take an action surrounding mercury, we are protecting public 
health and helping to reduce consumer demand of species caught in ways 
that are killing sea turtles.

If any of these items appeal to you, please read additional information 
below and thank you for supporting the Sea Turtle Restoration Project?s 
conservation efforts!

If you do take action on the Got Mercury or if you send a letter to the 
editor, please let us know!  It feeds our spirit, energy and motivation to 
know we are working together in solidarity!

Please call if you have any questions or comments.

THE THUGS who stole four puppies and other small critters from the W.B.
Saul High School of Agricultural Sciences over the weekend might have
thought they were making some kind of statement about animal rights.

But the students who loved the creatures - and had no intention of doing
any experimenting on them - are heartbroken.
...
"Go Experiment on Yourselves. We're Free - the Animals," was spray-painted
on the walls of the beagle pups' new kennel - which have heat,
air-conditioning and runs for each dog - and at the Small Animal
Technology Center nearby where rodents and other creatures are housed.
...
FBI special agent Joseph Majarowitz said the radical environmental group
Earth Liberation Front is being investigated across the country for
similar break-ins and animal thefts from research facilities and
government laboratories.

He agreed, however, that it is too early to pin this latest crime on that
cyber-savvy group.

"To them it would be that they are liberating animals," said Majarowitz,
who noted that such crimes are typically investigated as acts of domestic
terrorism.

BESIDES SERVING as an excellent excuse for avoiding family gatherings, the
vegan lifestyle is about more than food. Vegans don't "wear" animals
(wool, fur, leather, down, etc.) and do their damnedest to avoid using
animal products in any form. This is easer said than done. As Howard
Lyman, the cattleman-turned-vegan, says: "To make our choices informed
ones, we have to start with the facts."

Along comes the third edition of Animal Ingredients: A to Z to provide the
facts along with some philosophical and nutritional context, thereby
putting to rest the "where do you get your protein?" canard. But its true
value and power lies in the 2000-plus ingredient listings?more than even
the most seasoned vegan could imagine. While it doesn't require a ton of
initiative to teach oneself to avoid casein, whey or gelatin, who knew the
dirty little secret behind something called lipase? (It's an enzyme from
the "stomach and tongue glands of calves, kids and lambs" found in some
vitamin supplements.)

"MANY DISCRIMINATING cat lovers know exactly which cat they want, are
willing to pay for it and won't settle for anything less," reads the Web
site for Genetic Savings and Clone, which now is charging pet owners
$50,000 to clone their cat.
...
CC was born apparently healthy, but that's not the case with many cloned
animals. Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the Humane Society of the
United States, says pet cloning should be outlawed because "high failure
rates and compromised animal welfare are the most likely outcomes of this
experimental procedure." The famous cloned Dolly the sheep had arthritis
and aged prematurely.

Between the nights of April 9 and April 10, we broke into the Small animal
Laboratory and the Dog Kennel at W.B. Saul High School in Roxborough,
Philadelphia.

We removed a total of 48 animals - 44 small animals (some of which were
indeed being tested upon in lab experiments), and 4 beagle puppies being
raised by students training to be future vivisectors.

In total, we removed: four beagle puppies, two chinchillas, one ferret, 26
gerbils, three hamsters, nine rats, and two mice. All of the animals were
taken to new homes where they will be loved and cared for - not
experimented upon and not the training fodder for would-be vivisectors.

They will also not be put to death when their usefulness as an
"educational tool" is through. While there, we also took photographs of
several cruelties towards livestock animals - including a barn full of
cows chained by their necks to small stalls, where they are not even able
to turn around, and two young veal calves confined by themselves in small
cages.

A small but visible group of about 20 Smoky River rural residents opposing 
factory farms and supporting family farms gathered in front of Dunvegan MLA 
Hector Goudreau?s office in Falher last Friday to demonstrate their displeasure 
with the Province of Alberta government?s policy and position supporting factory 
farms.

Residents from throughout the region, and one from as far away as Fairview 
converged on the MLA?s office for the event hosted by Friends of an Unpolluted 
Lifestyle (FOUL), a group of property owners in the Municipal District of Smoky 
River who formed FOUL last fall to strengthen their forces to express their 
opposition to the Province of Alberta having complete control in locating and 
regulating confined feeding operations and intensive livestock operations.

However, the MLA was in Grande Prairie for the day as guest speaker to unveil 
the new logo for the new promotion of Branding the Peace, a commitment he 
made several months ago, Goudreau told the Express.

(For reaction from MLA Goudreau, turn to page 2.)

?We were pleased with the turnout for a first-time event and we received much 
support from the people we talked to,? says Tony Flowers, president of FOUL.

HI-TECH plastic bags which degrade in as little as 60 days are to be 
introduced at city supermarkets.



From the end of May, shoppers visiting Tesco stores in Peterborough will be 
given the new environmentally-friendly bags.

Green campaigners today said they would like other supermarkets and shops in 
the city to follow Tesco's lead and introduce the new technology.

The bags are made using an additive known as TDPA, which means they break 
down quickly and leave no harmful residues.

Following a trial last year, the bags are due to be introduced at Tesco 
stores across the country, including Tesco Extra at Serpentine Green, Hampton, 
Peterborough and Tesco Metro in Broadway, Peterborough by the end of May.

Tesco is the first UK supermarket to commit to offering all of its 13 million 
customers the chance to shop using totally degradable carrier bags.

UK supermarket chains Tesco, Asda and Safeway are importing substantial 
amounts of organic food rather than buying from UK farmers, even when UK supplies 
are available, according to a survey by the Soil Association, which certifies 
and promotes organic food.
In the period covered by the survey, less than a quarter of the organic pork 
on sale in Asda was from UK farms; in Tesco only half the pork and under half 
the organic beef was from the UK. Only 13% of Safeway?s cauliflowers were 
homegrown, and in Asda only 19% of onions were homegrown. 
In the UK, farmers producing organic pork must meet high animal welfare 
standards, which is not always the case in other countries, the Soil Association 
warned. All imported organic food must meet European organic legal requirements, 
but for some products such as pork these may be lower than the standards 
required of organic pork reared in the UK.

The Maryland Department of Natural Resources last week accepted an offer of 
$75,000 from the Fund for Animals and the Humane Society of the United States 
to mitigate bear and human conflicts. However, the DNR rejected the animal 
rightists' stipulation that the proposed bear hunting season in Allegany and 
Garrett counties be canceled. 
    Let me make it clear that what I'm about to comment on is my personal 
opinion. Allow me to recall an old western Maryland fishing partner, Gene Moon, 
who used to say, "If you sleep with dogs, sooner or later you're going to have 
fleas." I suggest that the DNR heed Moon's advice. 

    Agreed, the DNR serves all the people in Maryland, not just hunters, 
anglers and trappers. But, folks, if you enter into an unholy alliance with people 
whose objective is to stop all hunting and fishing, you're no better than 
they are. 
    That's what worries me. I'll wager the well-heeled Fund for Animals and 
the Humane Society are having parties right now, celebrating the fact that they 
got a foot into the door of an agency that regulates all the hunting and 
fishing of an American state.

Two more Japanese nationals have joined the growing list of wildlife poachers 
nabbed by Cape conservation officials while trying to smuggle wildlife or 
indigenous plants out of the country.

This week Terutoshi Terada and Masato Araki were each convicted in the 
Vredendal Regional Court of three charges under the Cape Nature Conservation 
Ordinance for poaching tortoises and other reptiles, and sentenced to a fine of R110 
000 or four years in jail.

The pair were arrested in Vredendal on March 14, and were found in possession 
of five angulate tortoises, 51 armadillo girdled lizards, one Karoo girdled 
lizard and one Bribron's thick-toed gecko.

These reptiles are all protected in terms of the conservation ordinance, and 
are also listed in Appendix 2 in the Convention for the International Trade in 
Endangered Species, which means any trade in these species is strictly by 
permit only.

ASPCA Special Investigator Annemarie Lucas hugs goat found neglected in 
Brooklyn garage yesterday. Another goat was found dead at the property. 

A Brooklyn homeowner got the goat of humane officers when he tried to turn 
his garage into a barnyard, authorities said yesterday. 
Agents responding to a report of "two lambs" at an undisclosed address found 
a dehydrated goat wandering around inside a garage, said ASPCA Special Agent 
Joseph Pentangelo. Nearby, they found a 4-foot-long crate containing three 
hens, two pigeons, and the remains of another goat and two more pigeons, he said. 
"We don't know why they had these animals," said Pentangelo. "It's 
undetermined whether they were keeping them for food or whether they were pets. But the 
fact that there were three dead animals there is certainly cause for concern."

BACK in January I decided to go raw.

No more heat for me, no siree.

I'd eat veggies, I'd eat fruit, I'd eat...nut butter.

For one month, I would not consume anything that had been heated above 118
degrees. Or was that 116 degrees? Hmmm, I'd have to check on that.

Why was I doing this?

Well, I'd like to tell you I have an unending dedication to my profession,
but it was actually curiosity, pure and simple, that got me to eat four
consecutive meals of sprouted quinoa.

Inspired by the promises of improved health, vitality and energy by raw
food visionaries, I was determined to find gastronomic enlightenment
without engaging in the oh-so passe practice of cooking.

Instead of steaming, I'd sprout. Instead of baking, I'd blend. Instead of
noshing on hot, cheesy pizza, I'd whip up a batch of Thai Green Papaya
Salad or Raw Borscht.

To tell you the truth, I was a little nervous.

I'm not a vegan. I'm not even a vegetarian. I would have to transition
from being a meat-eating, heat-using omnivore to having an entirely vegan,
frying pan-free existence.

An animal-rights group accused Neiman Marcus Group Inc. yesterday of
trying to ``cyberbully'' it into shutting down a ``Neiman Carcass'' Web
site, which blasts the high-end retailer for selling furs.

The Fund for Animals' neimancarcass.com site claims the retailer supports
``a morally bankrupt and inherently violent industry'' and contributes to
the suffering and death of millions of animals each year by selling fur.
The site also displays photographs of animals killed for fur, information
about anti-fur campaigns and links to other Web sites.

Neiman Marcus claims the Web site is deliberately and confusingly similar
to the retailer's famous name, and is being used to tarnish it. It filed a
complaint with the National Arbitration Forum, which resolves domain name
disputes, in a bid to wrest control of the neimancarcass.com,
neimancarcass.net, and neimancarcass.org names from the animal rights group.

        <docText> A national animal-rights organization has issued a plea for
people to flood Duke University Provost Peter Lange with letters and
e-mails calling for a halt to monkey "torture" at the university's primate
center.

There's just one problem with the "Thumbs Down" article in the Spring 2004
edition of the Animal Protection Institute's "Animal Issues" magazine:
It's wrong.

Duke's primate center doesn't harbor any monkeys, it doesn't do any
lasting invasive studies on the lemurs that it nurtures, and selective
quotes included in the article are taken out of context and are misleading.

        <docText>Events that let dogs tear into wild hogs within an enclosed 
area would be illegal if legislation approved by a House panel Wednesday becomes 
law. 
Exempted from the proposed ban are "Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials" in Winnfield 
and similar "hog baying" competitions that involve dogs herding or cornering 
hogs in a pen. 
But any event staged with the intention of injuring, maiming, mutilating or 
killing the animals would be outlawed by House Bill 1244, sponsor Rep. Warren 
Triche, D-Thibodaux, said. 
Even with the exemption, supporters of the 10-year-old Uncle Earl event 
turned out in force to oppose the legislation, saying it is merely the first step 
in an effort to outlaw all competitions pitting hog against dog. 
"I hate to see a lot of talking about maimed and mauled and killed . . . that 
don't happen," said Jimmy Young, a producer of the Uncle Earl event and a 
boar hunting devotee.

The UCSD Guardian
As part of the annual World Week for Animals in Laboratories campaign, 
activists from UCSD Students Against Animal Suffering and San Diego Animal Advocates 
protested on April 20 against animal testing conducted at UCSD. 
Protesters stood at the intersection of La Jolla Village Drive and Villa La 
Jolla Drive, passing out information and holding signs with messages such as ?
Unseen Cruelty, Suffering and Death? and ?Vivisection: Science Gone Mad.? 
?We learned of the cruel and wasteful experiments going on at UCSD and 
decided to have a protest in conjunction with World Week for Animals in Laboratories,
? Jill Fritz, president of San Diego Animal Advocates, said. 
Due to pressure from protesters, the UCSD School of Medicine decided in 
August 2003 to drop a course requirement in which students watched experiments and 
demonstrations on live dogs. 
According to Fritz, however, approximately 467 animal experiments are 
currently taking place at UCSD. 
The protesters said the school still uses primates, rodents and other animals 
to conduct research.

A Richardson Park woman whose pit bull mauled a 7-year-old girl earlier this 
month was charged Wednesday under a new state law for maintaining a dangerous 
dog. 
SPCA director John E. Caldwell said it is the first time anyone in the state 
has been charged with the felony statute enacted two years ago after a pit 
bull killed 2-year-old Zachary Grant in the back yard of his grandfather's Fox 
Point home. The charge applies when a dangerous animal kills or injures a person 
or animal in an unprovoked or unjustifiable attack. 
Melissa L. Carter, 31, of the 500 block of Eureka Ave., was released on 
$5,000 unsecured bail Wednesday after being charged with two counts of dog running 
at-large and biting, and the felony charge. 
SPCA animal control Officer Peter Corcoran determined that Carter's 2 1/2 
-year-old pit bull ran after a group of children April 9 in the 100 block of Lake 
Street in Elmhurst and bit three people, including a 7-year-old girl who 
suffered serious leg wounds, a 10-year-old boy and a 38-year-old woman who ran to 
the girl's rescue, Caldwell said. 
"When the dog was running at large, he bit a 10-year-old boy minutes after he 
attacked the girl," Caldwell said. 
According to court records, the 38-year-old woman saw the tan-and-white pit 
bull running unsupervised in the 100 block of Matthes Avenue nearly two hours 
before the attack. She told her daughter and her friend to play inside the 
fenced yard. About 1:45 p.m., she heard the children screaming in the yard. When 
she looked out the kitchen window, she saw the kids scattering and ran outside 
to find the dog grasping the 7-year-old's upper inner thigh and flailing her 
around "like a rag doll."

ONE of the hottest cooking trends requires no heat and no cooking.

Sound crazy? Not to the hoards of foodies, environmentalists, creative
vegetarians and chefs jumping on the raw food bandwagon.

Supporters say raw cuisine offers a new adventure in dining, with an
exciting array of tastes and textures. Best of all, they say, a raw food
diet is also the key to better health.

Eating raw is supposed to aid in the absorption of nutrients and
antioxidants because the vital enzymes in foods are not destroyed by the
cooking process. As a result, followers say they have improved energy,
mental clarity and a drastic reduction in the amount of sleep and food
their bodies need to function.

Eating in the raw has inspired such a following that more and more
cookbooks and restaurants are jumping on the trend.

Oxygen Bar in San Francisco has recently added raw food selections to its
menu, as has Caf Muse in Berkeley. Since 1997, when Juliano Brotman (who
goes by "Juliano") opened his now-defunct raw food restaurant in San
Francisco, raw food restaurants have popped up in New York, Arizona and
elsewhere in California.

        <docText>An anti-animal experimentation organization has placed the 
University of Connecticut in the top three of its worst federal law violators for 
treatment of laboratory animals.
The group ? Stop Animal Exploitation Now ? compiled a report that showed 
UConn?s Storrs campus had 43 violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act from 
May 2001 to January 2003.
That places UConn behind only the University of California at San Francisco 
and the University of Florida, with 51 and 47 violations respectively.
UConn?s Farmington laboratory also made the list, ranking number 10 on the 
list with 25 violations. The third Connecticut laboratory cited on the list was 
Yale University with 19 violations.
Michael Budkie, executive director of the Ohio-based nonprofit group, said 25 
research universities were included in the report, which found two problems 
in U.S. laboratories: poor conditions and poor enforcement by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.
He highlighted the fact UConn?s 43 violations all occurred after the 
university was fined $129,000 in March 2001.

Caroline Norton, left, and Jeff Dorson watch a video of an Alabama hog-dog 
rodeo Wednesday during a House Committee on the Administration of Criminal 
Justice hearing on a bill to outlaw hog-dog fighting. 
A heavily amended -- and opposed -- bill aimed at outlawing fights between 
dogs and hogs cleared a House committee Wednesday. 
Rep. Warren Triche, D-Thibodaux, told the House Committee on the 
Administration of Criminal Justice that he had significantly changed his House Bill 1244 
to mollify opponents. 
Those opponents included former Sen. B.B. "Sixty" Rayburn, who told the 
committee that late Gov. "Uncle" Earl Long first took him hog hunting in 1948. 
"This is the most discussed bill this session," said committee Chairman Rep. 
Danny Martini, R-Metairie. 
Proponents showed television coverage of a hog-dog fight in Clarke County, 
Ala. The report showed smiling families watching a pit bull rip the head of a 
hog whose tusks had been removed. 
Members voted 8-3 for legislation that would outlaw spectator events in which 
dogs attack feral hogs with the intent or likelihood is that one of the 
animals would maim or kill the other. 
The reconfigured HB1244 would allow hog hunting, hog herding, hog trials and 
other hog-related sporting events, Triche said. 
Hog-dog trials involve trained dogs chasing and chomping down -- often on the 
ears -- a penned feral hog.

"Many discriminating cat lovers know exactly which cat they want, are
willing to pay for it and won't settle for anything less," reads the Web
site for Genetic Savings and Clone, now is charging pet owners $50,000 to
clone their cat.

What the Savings and Clone calls "discriminating cat fanciers," most
Americans would call suckers or fools. (Another word a friend used was
"creepy.") Thousands of cats are killed every day in animal shelters for
want of a home. Yet some people with more money than sense are ready to
spend more than the median U.S. household income in a vain attempt to sort
of recreate their cat.

the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals pleaded no contest Thursday to
charges of stealing nearly $940,000 in donations.

Kenneth Brookwell, a former vice president and chief financial officer at

PITTSBURGH - Five people have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from what
state investigators called their largest investigation of a dogfighting
ring, one that included breeders, kennels, trainers, promoters and $50,000
purses.

The five men - including a pet store owner - were arrested in November
2002 in connection with the ring that investigators said had arranged
fights between pit bulls in basements and warehouses for at least five years.

According to arrest warrants, the ring sold pit bulls, training equipment,
drugs and surgical supplies. It also trained dogs to fight and had
organized and promoted fights in western and central Pennsylvania since
May 1997

The American habit of eating large amounts of meat is a major threat to
human health, the environment, small communities and farmers, according to
speakers at recent conference at the Bloomberg School of Public Health
(JHSPH) entitled "Eating for the Future: Can Public Health Rise to the
challenge?"

Scientists from diverse fields met at JHSPH to discuss whether humans need
meat in the quantity it is consumed in the United States, how our levels
of meat consumption affect American health and whether meat production
actually pollutes our environment.
...
On campus, the diet choice for students with regard to meat is diverse.
Many students eat a traditionally American amount of meat, such as
sophomore David Burgess who said "I eat meat at every meal." Others don't
feel meat is a necessity but eat it frequently, such as sophomore Karen
Lopez, who said "I don't need to eat meat every day. I do eat meat every
day, but it's not a necessity."

In sharp contrast to these views on meat consumption are the views of
senior Michael Brown, who is informally know as "Vegan Mike" by his
friends and acquaintances.

Brown summarized his views on meat eating, saying "the reason I don't eat
meat is that I think that raising animals in a factory farm environment
increases unnecessary suffering. I'm also a big fan of the fact that my
diet is cholesterol free." Brown, who has been a vegan since his freshman
year, and a vegetarian since he was 15 years old, also said that "the laws
regarding free range chicken are ridiculously loose," when asked about the
classification developed to give consumers an alternative to factory-
farmed livestock. While he supports attempts to reduce the suffering of
animals that are farmed for meat, he is still fundamentally opposed to the
slaughter of animals for food, saying "I don't feel that there is a humane
form of killing."

ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Facing a new Alaska program to hunt wolves from
airplanes, the animal-rights group Friends of Animals is trying to revive
its successful pressure tactic of a decade ago and persuade vacationers to
boycott the state this summer. But tourism officials say this time the
plea seems to be falling mostly on deaf ears.

?It seems for once Outsiders don't care how we do it in Alaska,? said Eric
Downey, vice president of marketing for Denali Lodges.
...
The Darien, Conn.-based Friends of Animals called for the boycott in
December to protest Alaska's aerial wolf control program. Under the
program, 180 wolves were to be killed this winter in two areas where
residents complain wolves and bears are eating too many moose, leaving
them with too few for food. About 140 wolves have been killed under the
program that ends April 30. The program will resume next winter.

ROWS OF GENETICALLY altered tobacco plants fill a Hayward greenhouse, but
they're not intended for cigarettes or cigars. Instead, they carry human
antibodies that may one day help ward off tooth decay and the common
cold., 

The plants are being developed by Planet Biotechnology of Hayward, one of
a new breed of biotech companies that are taking a green approach to
developing new drugs.

If successful, they could lead to faster and less costly production of
antibodies and proteins to treat anything from tooth decay to cancer, and
give what many consider a deadly weed a new role in helping save lives. 
...
A major benefit of using plants is that they radically reduce the cost of
production of drugs. They also eliminate the need to use transgenic
animals, a process that animal rights groups have protested.

RAMONA ? Penny Scott brushed one of two mares that had been shipped from
Alberta, Canada, to her Ramona ranch this year. Motioning to a stocky,
tricolor paint horse grazing on alfalfa, she said, "I call her Destiny,
because she's going to have one. She's not going to end up in some place."

It's hard for Scott to articulate where Destiny might have wound up had
she not intervened. Perhaps on a restaurant menu.

Scott is the Southern California representative for FoalQuest, an
organization that rescues mares and foals that might otherwise become part
of this country's $25 million-a-year horse meat export industry. The
rescued horses come from Canadian farms, where the urine of pregnant mares
is collected and sold to Wyeth Pharmaceutical, which uses it to make
Premarin, a drug used in hormone replacement therapy. After the mares give
birth in the spring, their foals are largely disposable. 
...
Organizations such as PETA say NAERIC and FoalQuest are "corporate
apologists" financed by Wyeth.

"I think the FoalQuest site is a mouthpiece for the industry," said Mary
Beth Sweetland, director of research and investigations for PETA. "No one
who cares about animals could promote Premarin, regardless of how well the
horses are cared for, because it all leads to exploitation."

"We think Premarin is dying a natural death," Sweetland said. "Maybe it's
the fact that women were downing horse urine rather than hormones that are
natural to the human body."

This is sort of an 'off-schedule'' posting, but I recieved a call over
the weekend to inquire more about this endeavor that has come from my
eager and innovative participants of the new coalition which was
originally formed in October of 2003.
Now, with a new platform but still actively promoting humane education
as a group,  our latest idea is garnering some substantial discussion
and interest among some heavy hitters.  Far out as it seems, it may
just be a workable plan.
 
Here's the idea in it's condensed version.  Please voice your opinions
and thoughts or offers to get involved.
 
$50 Million will change the face of education and civilization forever.

A one-time expenditure of $50 million would bring humane education to
our nations' schools

Due to the fact that I am not only proposing a philosophical conceptual
framework regarding the effectiveness of Humane Education, but I am
also a practitioner applying my theory within practical contexts, I
consider myself an action researcher. In other words, I don&#x2019;t only
provide the rationale and philosophical underpinnings of my work, I
actually go out there and apply it hands on. Furthermore, I am
collaborating with professional researchers who are capable of taking
my findings (i.e. data) and analyzing and interpreting those findings
(i.e. scientifically based research).

Although Americans have been donating a billion dollars annually to
their favorite animal protection group (that's AFTER the nearly one
billion they also pay in taxes for local and area animal control
efforts) for over 25 years, we still see few tangible results. I am so
determined to prove that my idea is a likely solution to many if not
most of our problems, that I have outlined it to the best of my
ability. We may need to include in this budget the cost for
professional research to offer the educators, who don't care about
humane education but do care about science, math and reading test
scores, that our program can improve all of the above.

So, with $2 billion each year going mainly to salaries, condos, jet
planes, office buildings and printing costs to raise more funds for
next year, I'm asking for just $50 million on a one time basis to start
this idea rolling on a  nationwide scale that will undoubtedly prove
its cause worthy. However, thus far, I've not even been able to fill
the $50 million costs.

off track: An elephant in a north Bengal forest 
Siliguri, April 18: Officials of the World Wide Fund for Nature and Wildlife 
Protection Society of India today took video footage of the tracks between 
Sukna and Gulma stations to strengthen their case against the Northeast Frontier 
Railway.
The Calcutta chapter of WWF had filed a public interest litigation in the 
high court in 2000, when the railway began laying broad-gauge lines 
criss-crossing elephant corridors and slicing through wildlife sanctuaries in the region.
The court had formed an advisory committee following the WWF complaint and 
guidelines were laid down to reduce the impact of the gauge-conversion on 
wildlife.
The death of the elephant hit by a goods train near Gulma last month prompted 
the environment group to allege that the railway was violating court orders. 
The gauge conversion was completed in November. An elephant has been injured 
and another killed in the past five months. Trains on the earlier metre-gauge 
tracks were responsible for more than 15 deaths in the past decade
?We will appeal to the court because the railway is flouting the guidelines 
recommended by the expert panel. We have sent a team to conduct an 
investigation and get spot video evidence that we can produce when we move court,? state 
director of WWF S.R. Banerjee said.
?We are here to prepare a report on the extent to which the court orders are 
being followed,? said Bulbul Ghosh, one of the two members on the visit.
Forest officials of Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary, through which the tracks 
pass, arranged for the tour today and what the team saw came as a ?shock?.
?The trenches dug along the tracks for the gauge-conversion have not been 
filled and they are now death traps for unsuspecting animals. The space left on 
either side of the tracks is not sufficient for such large animals to walk on. 
Elephants will not be able to cross the tracks fast enough. There was one 
board cautioning train drivers before entering elephant territory and that, too, 
worn out,? Ghosh said.

The Boston Globe's Sunday Magazine section (April 18, 2004) featured a 
front-page story about the bone-breaking experiment on six dogs at Tufts 
University School of Veterinary Medicine (TUSVM). The experiment ended in 
all six dogs being killed, one because of the complications of infection. 
The experiment was opposed by  students in Tufts' Animals and Public Policy 
program, as well as veterinary students who later withdrew their involvement 
because of the Policy students' decision to expose the research to the public.  
NEAVS supported the students throughout, including their efforts to work 
internally and, that failing, supported their courageous whistle-blowing. 

You can read the article "When Should Animals Die in the Name of Science" 
by visiting  http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/ Author, Douglas Starr, 
did justice to raising the debate, even within the limitations of the article's length. While 
he left some questions unanswered, he raised the important questions. Boston is a hub 
of pro-research sentiment and activity. For the Globe to feature this story was a 
breakthrough. 

Although NEAVS applauds Tufts for its past innovative programs in veterinary education, 
none of us can sit back and allow animal research such as this painful and unnecessary 
bone-breaking experiment to become their status quo.  NEAVS will continue to dialogue 
with Tufts and to exert public pressure to enhance policy changes which will guarantee that 
this kind of research ends once and for all. 

NEAVS, the Tufts' students and the general public have drafted a list of recommendations 
that will be presented to Tufts. These recommendations encourage Tufts to1) become a 
model for appropriate "alternatives searches," which would have obviated the need for the 
bone-breaking experiment, as well as its lethal end-point; 2) adopt a stricter model 
conflict-of-interest policy, which would eliminate all doubt that a given protocol and its 
approval might favor the economic interest of researchers who hold patents on a device 
being tested; 3) establish a policy by which students' input is not only accepted but encouraged
 and USED to expose remnants of old thinking and change practices that have justified the e
xperimental use of animals for education and research; and 4) ask that instead of fostering 
Tufts' students' involvement in animal research --as many of the new programs the Dean 
recently announced will do--that the university foster its students' skills and interest in 
developing 
and using alternatives to animal research.

Careful New Yorkers probably have insurance to cover the chance
fender-bender, house fire or surprise attack of the chicken pox. Now, if
a Bronx lawmaker has his way, they will have to take out yet another
policy - one for their dogs.
State Assemblyman Peter M. Rivera, a Democrat whose district is in the
Bronx, proposed a new bill last month that, if passed, would require all
dog owners in New York State to have liability insurance for their pets.
The bill, which Mr. Rivera said would probably be ready for debate on the
Assembly floor in a month, is called "Elijah's Law" for a 3-year-old boy,
Elijah Torres, who was seriously injured in an attack by a Rottweiler in
the Bronx last fall.

The law would circumvent the major sticking point in dog attack cases in
New York City, Mr. Rivera said. Currently, an attack victim can take
legal action only if a dog is documented as "dangerous," a designation
assigned only after the dog has already bitten, he said. 
"There's an old doctrine that says an owner is not liable until a dog is
declared dangerous," Mr. Rivera said. "My legislation would require that
any dog owner has to have insurance."
A summary of the bill offered grim statistics. In 2002, a total of 5,176
dog bites were reported in New York City, it stated darkly. Nationwide,
dogs bite about 7,000 mail carriers a year, it said. (The Postal
Service's Web site noted that the count, taken in 1983, fell by half by
the late 1990's.)
More children, according to the summary, visit emergency rooms for dog
bites than for the total of injuries on playgrounds and from bicycles,
mopeds, all-terrain vehicles, in-line skating, and skateboards combined.
Mr. Rivera said compliance would be affordable, costing between $75 and
$100 annually. Still, it was not clear whether insurance companies would
agree with the figures.
Other questions have been raised. It took years for New York State
drivers to finally surrender to mandatory vehicle insurance in the late
1950's. How long would they drag their heels with their dogs?
In New York City, officials from the city's main animal shelter and the
Department of Health cautioned that laws already require dog owners to
purchase licenses for their pets, as proof that the animal has been
vaccinated, but only about one fifth of all dog owners actually comply.
City residents own about 530,000 dogs, but only about 110,000 are
licensed, according to Department of Health estimates. 
"It's a very anemic licensing program in New York City," said Edward
Boks, executive director of Animal Care and Control, a group the city
employs to run its animal shelters, which take in 45,000 lost cats, dogs
and other animals each year.
Then there is the problem of making sure all dogs are insured. 
"It's wonderful to have these laws, but enforcing them costs money," Mr.
Boks said. "We have a very difficult time enforcing the leash law and the
license law."
Still, Mr. Rivera said, the state should make an attempt.
"It may be a burden, but it's a positive burden."

Accompanied by a neighbor, Deborah Dixon questioned the council and mayor 
Monday evening about dealing with vicious dogs. ?I want to know about the 
amendment about vicious dogs ? on keeping a vicious animal in the city limits of 
Lonoke, Arkansas. It?s out of hand. It?s happened to me, where I live, it?s all 
over town. Someone?s going to get killed,? she told the council.

On March 25, two pit bull terriers broke through a wooden fence and into the 
yard of Deborah Dixon of Fairview Street. The dogs attacked and killed Dixon?s 
Pomeranian, decapitating the smaller dog.

?It?s not just the dog. It could have been my daughter,? she remarked.

Mayor Tom Privett said he is unfamiliar with any requirements in dealing with 
vicious dogs. However, the two pit bulls are in custody and the owner has 
been cited, he said.

?We need to make it a city law that if you have a dog considered in the 
vicious category, it should be registered, and it should be bonded for insurance 
purposes. Because what happened to me, it could have been me. Where I live, they?
re all around, and they are not pets. They are mean, vicious dogs all around,?
 Dixon said.

   More than 200 people overflowed the Barrow County
and Winder jails after a raid on a Barrow County
cockfight Sunday afternoon, said Barrow County Sheriff
Joel Robinson.
   The two jails combined are built to hold about 100
people, but after about 230 were arrested, deputies
put some in a jail recreation area, others in visiting
rooms and still others in at least one courtroom in
the nearby courthouse.
   As of Monday afternoon, about 24 hours after the
raid, an estimated 100 people still remained to be
booked, Robinson said.
   Most of those arrested were charged with
misdemeanor animal cruelty, the sheriff said.
   Robinson said he did not know whether any felony
charges would result from the bust. Under Georgia law,
animal cruelty can be prosecuted as a felony if a
person ''knowingly or maliciously'' causes the death
or disfigurement of an animal.
   The bust culminated an eight-month investigation
that began with aneighbor's complaint and eventually
grew to include the FBI, Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, Athens-Clarke County police and other
police agencies, Robinson said.
   Initially, investigators thought the case was
solely a cockfighting investigation, but last week
heard that dogfighting was also being practiced at a
farm on Hancock Bridge Road, the sheriff said.
Investigators flew over in a helicopter Thursday and
were able to pick out what looked like eight to 10 dog
kennels, he added.
   Investigators had expected to book only about 100
people in the raid. Because so many more were arrested
than expected, by Monday afternoon law officers still
had not been able to execute the search warrants they
had carried with them to the farm off Georgia Highway
11 near the Jackson County line, Robinson said.
   About 93 cars were impounded and a large amount of
cash was seized - just how much is unknown, because it
hadn't all been counted as of Monday afternoon, he
said.
   Suspected gamblers included people from South
Carolina, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee and even
California, judging from the tags on impounded
vehicles, Robinson said.
   Most of those arrested were Mexican immigrants, he
said.
   Although cockfighting is against the law in most of
the United States, it is legal in Mexico as well as
two of the United States, Louisiana and New Mexico.
   But polls show that like other Americans, most
Mexican-Americans are opposed to cockfighting, said
Wayne Pacelle, a senior vice president of the Humane
Society of the United States, the nation's largest
animal protection organization.
   Between 90 and 100 law enforcement officers
participated in the raid, Robinson said.
   ''It was very large-scale,'' Barrow County
Sheriff's Maj. Murray Kogod said.
   Law enforcement officers from 10 agencies spent
about six hours Sunday flushing out dozens of people
who fled into nearby woods after the raid began at
about 2 p.m.
   Authorities believed violent cockfights and
pit-bull fights were held at the 11-acre property on
most Sundays. Officers rescued more than a dozen
animals but found several others dead around the
property.
   In cockfighting, short knives or curved spikes are
attached to roosters' spurs before the birds are
placed together in a pit. The animals fight until one
can't go on, and the fights often result in the death
of one or both of the birds, Pacelle said. They are
often given stimulants to increase aggression before
the fight, he said.
   The raid was the second major gambling and animal
fighting bust in Georgia this year.

Four orphaned gorillas which arrived in South Africa last week should be sent 
to a sanctuary in Cameroon, the NSPCA said on Monday. 
The four primates from Cameroon, dubbed the Taiping Four, were orphaned when 
their parents were killed for bush meat in the west African country. 
The siblings, three female and one male, were smuggled from Cameroon to 
Nigeria and exported via South Africa to Taiping Zoo in Malaysia in 2001 on 
fraudulent documents. 
Rick Allan, spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals said the Limbe Wildlife Centre of the World Society for the 
Protection of Animals in Cameroon could accommodate the four western lowland 
gorillas. 
"They would be able to live out the rest of their lives in safety and 
security but in preferable conditions ? including climate, roaming area and 
integration with others of their species ? than can be provided by a zoo. In this 
proven facility, the animals' biodiversity behaviours will be satisfied." 
Allan said the Pretoria Zoo had one gorilla. "Five others have died there. 
The Taiping Four are in quarantine. South Africa has no native gorillas."

...and they're after Rich Cookson, who, covered in a variety of ghastly but 
dog-friendly scents, has offered himself up as prey for a day's drag-hunting in 
the New Forest. But does this non-fatal alternative to bloodsports still 
carry the same thrill of the chase?
19 April 2004 
I have rarely smelt this bad. My legs and hands are covered in a mixture of 
vegetable oil, artificial rabbit scent, dog biscuits, canine saliva and a 
chemical that smells uncannily like chicken tikka masala. It's also an unseasonably 
hot day, and running up this hill isn't making me smell any sweeter.
Dragging along behind me, on a piece of twine, is a sock that's been stuffed 
with pebbles and rags, and liberally doused with the oil, rabbit-juice and 
curry powder. Wherever I run, it leaves an invisible trial that, somewhere in the 
woods below, seven sharp-nosed hounds are following to track me down.
It may be distinctly low-tech, but this malodorous sock-on-a-string is at the 
heart of a country sport that could see a massive surge in popularity if the 
Government makes good its election promise to ban hunting with hounds. 
Drag-hunting is similar to conventional hunting in many respects, except that hunters 
and their hounds follow an artificial scent laid by a runner or a pony, 
rather than chasing live animals such as foxes or deer. On the face of it, this 
"cruelty-free" brand appears to offer a neat compromise between animal-welfare 
campaigners and hunting supporters - but many die-hard hunters simply don't see 
it that way.
There is one other important distinction, especially for me as today's 
quarry: I won't be mauled by a pack of hungry dogs and then shot, when they 
eventually track me down. At least, that's what they told me back at the car...

Investigators found more than 100 animal carcasses scattered around the
property of a woman who once ran a kennel from her house.

Mary Meekins of Rowland faces about 150 counts of cruelty to animals and
several other charges, said Katherine Floyd, the equine- and
animal-cruelty investigator for Robeson County.

Investigators first searched the property Sunday and found piles of bones
and shallow graves along with the carcasses. They returned Monday to
impound the remaining live animals and search for the dead ones.

State lawmakers have been offered free tickets to see the Ringling Bros.
and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Sunday at Albany's Pepsi Arena, cour- tesy of
the producer of the show, Feld Entertainment Inc.

 If they were around Albany last Friday, they could have seen another free
show, this one meant to demonstrate the cruelty circus animals allegedly
endure. A male and female representative of the group People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, body-painted to look like leopards, crouched
virtually naked inside metal cages across from the Capitol in a cold,
misty rain for an hour.

Kayla Worden, of Asheville, N.C., a 42-year-old actress and model who now
works for PETA, wore only pasties and panties, while 35-year-old Kristo -
he goes by only one name - wore just skimpy briefs.

Attention Boston dog owners! Councillors Rob Consalvo and James Kelly have
introduced an ordinance that requires residents to register their ?pit
bulls? with the city at a cost of $50 annually. Pit bulls are defined as
American Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American
Staffordshire Terriers, or any mix of those breeds. The measure also
limits residents to two pit bulls and requires owners to leash and muzzle
their dogs when in public. Additionally, owners must display a sign on
their property stating that a pit bull is located on the premises.
Violators will be subject to a $100 fine and the pit bull will be
immediately impounded. Exemptions are provided for animals participating
in contests, shows or exhibitions within city limits, but animals may not
remain for more than two weeks.
...
Breed-specific legislation is opposed by the AKC, the American Veterinary
Medical Association, the National Animal Interest Alliance, National
Animal Control Association, the ASPCA, and a host of national animal
welfare organizations that have studied the issue and recognize that
targeting breeds simply does not work.

        <docText>he man now in the Oval Office hunts. Next year's
occupant almost certainly will. There's a better-than-even chance that his
successor will stalk game with a gun - probably quail or duck, maybe deer.

Chances are, you don't. Fewer than 6 percent of Americans are hunters. But
we love to put them in the White House. Eisenhower, Johnson, Carter,
Bushes father and son - half the presidents of the last 50 years have been
avid hunters (photo-op sportsmen factored out).

At an hour when a good many Americans were still in bed, George W. Bush
celebrated New Year's with a father-son quail hunt in Texas; W. killed
about five.

Presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry hunts every chance he can get.
He can talk in detail about duck, deer, dove - shooting and gutting them,
roasting and eating them.

It's more than the macho thing. All over the world, masculinity is a
prerequisite for power, but few hunters are in residence in presidential
palaces from Italy to France to Japan. Like cowboys, hunters are
quintessentially American.
...
In times of national crisis, voters have a gut-level attraction to the
biggest of the big-T's. They are our frontier heroes, able to shoot the
bear between the eyes and destroy the savage enemy we don't understand.

This year's presidential election takes place during one of the most
uncertain periods in modern American history. So it is no surprise that we
have narrowed the battle to two men - George W. Bush and John Kerry - who
love to hunt and are adept at presenting themselves as heroic warriors.

It is the first time in 40 years that two hunters fought it out for the
presidency, and only a victory by vegetarian Ralph Nader - particularly
unlikely in a time of war - would prevent the inauguration of a hunter
president in January.

The group endorsed candidates, who some called a faction of
anti-immigration and militant animal rights activists.
...
A group called Club Members for an Honest Election said the landslide
victory of five candidates in the Sierra Club National Board of Directors
election was obtained through unfair campaign practices, and said it plans
to file a lawsuit to overturn the election.

The group consists of environmental activists and professionals, including
Marcia Hanscom from the Wetlands Action Network, Tim Hermach from the
Native Forest Council in Eugene, Ore. and Steve Bloom, and environmental
activist living in Oakland.
...
The 2004 Sierra Club election has been controversial and received a great
deal of media attention because of accusations that there were outside
anti-immigration and militant animal rights organizations trying to take
over the club by obtaining all five seats up for grabs.

In a series of precise, swift, vertical motions, junior in engineering Jon
Fisher drove his cleaver through a ginger root ? the rhythm of his
chopping echoing throughout the kitchen. He then slid the knife under the
minced vegetable and set it aside to begin slicing through a thick brick
of tofu.

"I'm pressing the tofu to increase moisture in the crevices," Fisher told
an onlooker as he squeezed the grayish-white cube between his palms.

Fisher participated in the second Vegetarian Iron Chef competition held
Tuesday night in the Bevier Hall cafeteria. The event, based on a popular
television program, featured two teams of eight student and community
chefs. The teams, representing Campus Vegetarian Society (CVS) and the
Common Ground Food Co-op, competed to create dishes revolving around a
secret ingredient.

Gary Yourofsky and Kate Timko, from Royal Oak, Mich., have stopped in
Halifax County for two days to explain the benefits of a vegan lifestyle,
and, what they believe are, the cruel methods used to supply humans with meat.

As vegans, they do not eat anything with a face, a mother or a bowel
movement, or anything that comes from an animal, such as milk, eggs,
cheese and honey. They also don't wear animal skin, such as leather, wool
or fur.

The two are members of ADAPTT, (Animals Deserve Absolute Protection Today
and Tomorrow). They travel to schools and towns all over the country to
spread their message, and stopped at Halifax Community College Monday and
today to speak to students. They will also speak to any members of the
public Thursday at 6 p.m. in room 401, building 400.

New Jersey's Janet Skarbek may very well be the next Erin Brockovich.

This mother and author from claims to have uncovered a cluster of people
who died from mad cow disease in Cherry Hill. The state says she's wrong.
But one thing is certain - Janet Skarbek is stirring up quite a bit of
controversy, reports The Early Show correspondent Melinda Murphy.

That's because public health officials are hoping no one in the U.S. will
ever develop the human form of mad cow disease. They've been on the
lookout since America's first infected cow was discovered last December.
The cow was later found to be imported from Canada, and the U.S.
government says our beef supply is safe.

That's where Skarbek comes in.

Our pets are important to us all. They are considered family members. We
treat them like brothers and sisters. We spend millions per year on
medicines, food, toys and ugly clothing-like items. Heck, there's even a
couple of TV stations devoted to pets.

It's not surprising that those emotions can easily extend to other animals.

But, sometimes that emotion goes a tad too far.

Found in the Mailbox this week: A report from Philadelphia's City Paper
(not the hallowed Inquirer; this paper is named (City Paper) about a
bizarre kidnapping case. Missing: 48 animals from a high school.
...
The Mailbox wonders if such animal rights groups keep their targets set
high on big businesses for reasons other than the ethical treatment of
animals.

Groups like PETA, and the unnamed kidnapping group, could do so much more
good for their causes by helping out their local, no-kill shelters.

If it ain&#x2019;t broke don&#x2019;t fix it. When it comes to the current laws regarding 
the withdrawal of feeding tubes in the terminally ill and permanently 
comatose, this sound bit of practical advice needs to be heeded.


But recently the Pope proclaimed that feeding tubes should never be 
withdrawn from any patient and that health-care providers are morally 
obligated to provide nutrition and hydration regardless of a patient's 
wishes. The Pope's order spells trouble for your health care -- not only 
because it threatens to undermine a powerful social consensus in the United 
States about your right to refuse medical treatment, but also because it 
means you can no longer be sure whether a hospital will respect your request 
or that of your loved ones making a decision for you.

In comments March 20 before the World Federation of Catholic Medical 
Associations, the Pope stated that patients who are permanently comatose are 
&#x201c;always human&#x201d; and &#x201c;never become &#x2018;vegetables&#x2019; or &#x2018;animals.'" He went on to 
say that nutrition and hydration should be provided indefinitely even if 
there is no hope of a patient's recovery.


The Pope&#x2019;s position is directly at odds with current clinical practice in 
U.S. hospitals. In the 1990 case of Missouri's Nancy Cruzan, the U.S. 
Supreme Court answered the question of whether food and water are medical 
treatments that can be declined. Cruzan was in a car crash that left her in 
a persistent vegetative state -- her brain did not get oxygen for many 
minutes and was so damaged that doctors said she could not possibly ever 
think or feel again. But, at the insistence of U.S. Attorney General John 
Ashcroft, who was then Missouri's state attorney general, Cruzan was kept 
alive by a feeding tube despite the wishes of her family.

LOWELL Rose McGarry owns a pet dog and 11 ducks. And she adores filet
mignon too much to be a vegetarian.

But when she ate lunch recently at J.J. Boomers on Pawtucket Boulevard,
she didn't like what she saw.

Near the bar was an arcade-type game featuring a 50-gallon tank with
flashy lighting and sound effects. For $2, a customer can operate a
miniature crane much like the popular stuffed-animal amusement seen in
restaurants and carnivals.
...
Peter Gollub, director of law enforcement at the Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said he hadn't heard of Lobster Zone
and would need details before determining if the game "deserved a closer
look."
...
People for the Ethical Treatment Animals, the radical animal-rights group,
has denounced Lobster Zone as cruel.

"Lobsters aren't stuffed animals," said William Rivas-Rivas, spokesman for
PETA, whose Web site lauds actress Drew Barrymore for her desire to
release all lobsters from holding tanks. "Their pain and fear are real."

A few years ago, PETA jousted verbally with Lobster Zone's inventor, J. R.
Fishman of Florida, who touted his game as "something different" and a
money-maker.

U.S. cattle futures fell Friday on a
trading floor rumor that a Texas animal was being tested for mad cow
disease, but a state official said it was untrue.

"It is strictly a rumor. There is no truth to it," said Beverly Boyd, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture. "They are not holding
carcasses of any kind."

PHOENIX -- Environmental groups that illegally interfere with everything
from animal research to logging would be subject to the same criminal laws
and financial sanctions as members of the Mafia and the Taliban under the
terms of legislation given preliminary approval Thursday by the House of
Representatives.

On a voice vote, lawmakers agreed to redefine the definition of criminal
racketeering to include ecological or animal terrorism. That law allows
the government to go after the assets of not only those who commit certain
crimes but the organizations that support them. 
...
"If you spray paint a building and it costs $250 or more (to repair) you
could be labeled an animal or ecological terrorist,'' she said. "It
belittles the term 'terrorism.'"

For so many of us meat-loving Americans, nothing gets our blood boiling
quite like the antics of the infamous extremist animal rights group, PETA.

Most of us know PETA as People for Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Interestingly, I came across another organization while searching online
that also used this same acronym to describe their coalition: People
Eating Tasty Animals. Their Web site defined itself as a "A resource for
those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting, and the
fruits of scientific research."

So why was I researching PETA online, you may ask? Well, every once in
while, these extremists make a headline with their latest campaign that
piques my interest in the same way it's piqued when I smell a funny odor
in my environment and wonder of it's source. I suppose that's what PETA
wants - just to stir things up, make people a bit uncomfortable and see
how many headlines they can make in the process.
...
And here is my solemn vow: once they convince the lions, snakes and bugs
to accept the PETA way of life, I too will take up the PETA flag.

So go ahead PETA, witness to the carnivorous beasts of the world, so that
they may see the light. But you may want to soften your message first, it
will make it easier for Simba to digest.

PASADENA -- Investigators discovered hair fibers at the scene of last
summer's SUV arson spree that they hoped to link to hair provided by
jailed Caltech graduate student Bill Cottrell, according to search
warrants unsealed Friday.

A federal judge ordered the release of 48 search warrants connected to the
investigation of the arsons -- an act claimed by the Earth Liberation
Front --revealing new details of the arrests of Cottrell and of Pomona
activist Josh Connole.

Also Friday, at the Central Detention Center in San Bernardino, Cottrell
submitted to a judge's order to provide the FBI with a saliva sample.
Investigators hope to use "nuclear DNA" in his saliva to link him to hair
found on a hat at the crime scene, according to Cottrell's attorneys. The
investigators had already obtained hair samples from Cottrell, but could
only use it to compare "mitochondrial DNA."

EWING - The head of the township health department and a former animal
control official yesterday were charged in connection with the killing of
20 cats in their care at the Ingham Avenue animal shelter in October.

The New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals filed 20
counts of "procuring the needless killing of an animal" against township
Health Officer Albert Leff and 20 counts each of "needlessly killing an
animal" and "abusing a living animal" against David E. Smith of 7th
Street, a retired animal control officer brought in by the township when
its regular officer refused to do the killing.

HELENA &#x2014; The two men wandered into the Stevensville tavern and the 
conversation turned to hunting and fishing &#x2014; not unusual in any Montana bar. 
They asked about one of the bar's regulars they'd heard about, a local named 
Ben Ruiz.

Before long, Ruiz approached the pair and offered his services, telling them 
he was a hunting and fishing outfitter. He said he could not only arrange a 
hunting or fishing trip but could get one of the men, from Iowa, an illegal 
Montana resident hunting license &#x2014; for a price.

What Ruiz didn't know was the two men were undercover state game wardens 
investigating reports that Ruiz, who was not a licensed outfitter, was 
arranging illegal hunts.

Wildlife officials say Ruiz, who later was convicted or pleaded guilty to 
seven misdemeanor fish and game violations, is just one example of what they 
consider a troubling and growing trend in Montana &#x2014; people taking cash to 
help others poach.

Increase in cases

Poaching is hardly a new phenomenon to Montana, and most cases still involve 
individuals illegally killing animals. The most common citations remain 
hunting or fishing without a license or hunting on private property without 
permission.

But wildlife officials say that over the past decade, they have seen an 
increasing number of cases of what they call "illegal commercialization" of 
wildlife, in which money &#x2014; sometimes thousands of dollars &#x2014; is exchanged to 
arrange illegal hunts.

"People are willing to pay large amounts of money to kill a trophy animal 
and don't care if it's illegal or not," said Jim Kropp, chief of law 
enforcement for the state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. "They get 
comfortable hunting behind locked gates and shooting what they see.

"Things Montanans see every day and take for granted are worth huge amounts 
of money to some individuals," he said.

Kropp said it is difficult to provide accurate figures on how big an 
increase there has been in such illegal hunts. But he said it has been 
steady enough that catching those involved in illegal paid hunts has become 
a major focus for game wardens.

Students and area residents settled into Lisa Link Peace Park Thursday and
Friday, protesting the use of animals in scientific research at the
University of Wisconsin.

During the event, which coincides with World Laboratory Animal Liberation
Week, activists advocated to passersby, with one demonstrator sitting in a
cage slightly larger than a mini-fridge.

Student organization Madison Coalition for Animal Rights and community
group Alliance for Animals displayed posters of a primate in a seemingly
painful device. They also showed videos of animals undergoing surgery for
research.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is gathering information on a cow that
was ordered destroyed at a West Texas meatpacking plant, a USDA official
said Friday.

USDA spokesman Ed Loyd said he didn't have confirmation on why the cow was
killed Wednesday, and said it wasn't immediately clear if a tissue sample
had been taken for a test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known
as mad cow disease.

"Clearly there was some indication that there was a problem with this
animal," Loyd said. "We cannot jump to the conclusion that it has BSE.
That's why there's testing done."

A cow at a meatpacking plant was destroyed after it showed signs of having
a central nervous system disorder and will be tested for mad cow disease,
a U.S. Department of Agriculture official said Friday.

USDA spokesman Ed Loyd said the cow was destroyed at a slaughter house
Wednesday and will be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also
known as mad cow disease.

Central nervous system disorder is one of the signs of BSE. Animals
showing any kind of aggressive behavior are destroyed and do not enter the
food supply, Loyd said.

"There are also many reasons an animal would exhibit signs." Loyd said.
"We cannot jump to the conclusion that it has BSE. That's why there's
testing done."

Animal rights campaigners are going to increasingly drastic lengths to
have their voices heard, reports David Fisher as we discover how a night
raid unfolds.

Farmers and scientists are being targeted in an increasingly intensive
campaign of fear by anti-vivisectionists and activists linked to the
international Animal Liberation Front.

A special police intelligence unit, which also deals with terror attacks,
believes the groups are stepping up their activities. In the past year
there have been death threats, cars doused in paint stripper and break-ins.

It's spring, when thoughts usually turn to warm-weather topics like
barbecues, tank tops and colossal home runs by Barry Bonds.

But this year, at least in the online world, spring has raised a wintry
matter, fur - and a flap over three other little letters: c, a, s.

Those three letters have led Neiman Marcus Group Inc., one of the
country's most conspicuous high-end retailers, to try to shut down three
Web sites for the Fund for Animals, a national organization founded in
1967 by former author and humanitarian Cleveland Amory.

Why Neiman Marcus? Because Silver Spring-based Fund for Animals, seeking
to use parody as a weapon in its fight against fur sales, dropped two
letters - "m" and "u" - from the retailer's name, and replaced them with
c, a and s to create a new name for its anti-fur Web sites: NeimanCarcass.

As a result, the unhappy company has filed a complaint against the
animal-rights group's Web-hosting company, Carol/Trevelyan Strategy Group,
or CTSG, with the National Arbitration Forum, an agency that resolves
disputes over Internet domain names.

 The situation we face here is that the public and 3 of 4 parliamentary 
 parties support a battery farm ban. The fourth party, the conservatives, 
 in government, want to defend battery farming to the end. Is it 
 possible, if we put all energy and imagination into it, to exert so much 
 pressure onto an unwilling government, to ban an industry under these 
 circumstances, which is in itself quite powerful and big. Time will tell.
 
 The date for the parliamentary-debate of the battery farm ban has been 
 moved from the 20th to the 27th of April, i.e. next Tuesday. The 
 Conservative Party delegation has agreed to meet me 15 minutes before 
 the debate to be handed over all the petitions we have collected since 
 beginning of March (which are 5000). We have a little surprise for them 
 then. In any case, here is what happened between 14th April and today.
 
 1) On 15th April, a weekly magazine published a debate between me and 
 the agricultural minister, albeit this debate was only done on the 
 phone, arranged by the journalist. I critisized the law, he only wanted 
 to brand me and animal rights as radical.
 
 2) On 15th April also, the by far biggest weekly magazine in Austria 
 arranged a debate between the head of the government comission on the 
 animal issue, the battery farmer of Austria's largest battery farm 
 (450.000 hens), the agricultural minister and me, believe it or not. The 
 comission spokeswoman critisized the government but was very held back 
 in her arguments. The battery farmer was shocked to see me on the table 
 and said I belong in prison and not here. He would have refused to come 
 had he known I was here, he said. He claimed to love his birds and that 
 his way of keeping them is in their best interest. The minister doubted 
 that I as a vegan are in a position to debate the keeping of farm 
 animals. He said consumers should decide, not the law. I said that only 
 vegans can really represent the animals' interests, because only they 
 have not their own interests in the animals, i.e. they do not suffer a 
 collision of interests between theirs and those of the animals. We had 
 broken into 5 battery farms owned by the battery farmer on the table and 
 had brought him to court, in answer he had brought charges against me, 
 so the two of us were not too friendly with each other. But eventually, 
 it became a hot debate between the minister and me on battery farming. 
 The whole thing lasted 2 hours and was supposed to be published 
 yesterday, but was delayed for a week. I hope its not the Conservatives 
 succeeding in trying to hinder it.
 
 3) Today, just now, we have our 54th demo for a battery farm ban since 
 21st February, when we started with the demo campaign. In our latest 
 siege of the ministry of agriculture on Wednesday 21st, the minister 
 actually came out and confronted the activists. He claims we should not 
 protest outside his ministry, as he is not in the position to ban 
 battery farming, only the government can do that.
 
 4) The flyposting is running on a high. So far, 1500 placards have been 
 put up everywhere. 2 people have been arrested while flyposting, quite a 
 new police tactic. It has not been known that ever anybody has been 
 arrested for such an offence. Also, as there are presidential elections 
 this Sunday, the Conservatives have started paying watch groups to guard 
 their placards and chase activists putting up anti-conservative posters. 
 A number of confrontations were had, but all went ok, i.e. so far all 
 activists escaped unharmed.
 
 5) For the presidential elections, we had asked all candidates on their 
 opinion on battery farming and the animal issue. The conservative 
 candidate was the only one trying to evade anwering our questions. She 
 said she finds the law as it is sufficient. We put as much energy as 
 possible into spreading this view, through demos and posters and 
 leafletting etc. She reacted last Sunday 19th by putting out a press 
 release saying that the law, indeed, should be tightened. Obviously she 
 feels the pressure, although she did not want to say exactly in which 
 way the law should be tightened. Yesterday, activists tried to disrupt 
 her last public rally before the elections tomorrow. Police intervened, 
 but some disruption was achieved and our banners were visible to 
 everybody. Lets hope she is not our new president after this Sunday.
 
 6) But yesterday we succeeded in our biggest coup as yet. On Thursday, 
 the agricultural chamber had organized a visit with experts to the first 
 Austrian battery farm with enriched cages. Their press release said how 
 wonderful this farm is, and what a compromise, with happy healthy birds. 
 As it happened, in the night after this visit, and BEFORE their press 
 release went out, activists visited the very same farm in the night and 
 got good footage of fotos and videos of the farm and its awful 
 conditions, of dead rotting birds in the cages and of birds without 
 feathers. So, we were in the position to counter their PA immediately 
 with our own PA that showed pictures of the very same farm which were 
 only 5 hours old!! They must have been steaming, as well as wondering 
 where in their midst the whistle blower might be!!
 
 7) In preparing new actions, I have spoken to journalists from state TV. 
 They told me that our campaign is a big issue in the internal media 
 world and they admire us for how much pressure we have managed to 
 create. Nice to hear.
 
 8) I have managed to persuade all big Austrian national animal welfare 
 and animal rights groups to pay together an advert, which is an appeal 
 to the prime minister to ban battery farming, signed by 50 prominent 
 Austrians from arts and science. On next Tuesday, the day of the 
 parliamentary debate, this advert will be published half page in the 
 conservative daily newspaper. If it is perceived well, I might get the 
 groups to finance publishing the same advert in a number of other 
 newspapers, especially since many newspapers drop costs by more than 50% 
 and up to 100%.

For Immediate Release

FUND FOR ANIMALS SAYS STATE IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OF 13 
YEAR OLD HUNTER

AUSTIN, TX (April 26, 2004) The Fund for Animals, a national animal 
protection organization which operates Black Beauty Ranch, a 
world-famous 1600 acre sanctuary in Murchison, Texas, has called on 
Governor Rick Perry to establish a minimum hunting age of sixteen. The 
call comes in response to the death of 13 year old Michael Lynn Russell 
who was shot and killed on April 19 while hunting with his 11 year old 
cousin on the Lone Star Hereford Ranch in Clay County. Texas has no 
minimum hunting age, and does not require hunter safety classes for 
children under 17.

In a letter to Governor Perry, program coordinator Norm Phelps called 
that policy so irresponsible that the Government of the State of Texas 
is directly responsible for the death of Michael Russell, since such 
tragedies are an entirely foreseeable result of DPW policy. Young 
children lack the patience, emotional control, and mature judgement to 
operate a firearm safely or take prudent precautions to assure their own 
safety in a hunting situation where close oversight by an adult is often 
impossible. The presence of his adult uncle did not protect Michael. 
Children are by nature excitable, impatient, and impulsive; that is part 
of being a child. In the excitement of a hunt, children even the most 
responsible of them cannot be counted on to exercise the caution and 
restraint that are the essential ingredients of hunting safety.

According to Fund for Animals president Michael Markarian, Nationwide, 
the hunting industry is trying to increase their revenues by recruiting 
children. But the state of Texas needs to just say no to corporate and 
bureaucratic greed that puts children at risk. Our children's lives are 
more important than the sale of hunting licenses. If Texas had a minimum 
hunting age of sixteen, Michael Lynn Russell would be alive today.

Washington - The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the nation's 
largest animal protection organization, today named Wayne Pacelle as its 
new leader and Chief Executive Officer - Designate. Pacelle will fully 
assume the executive leadership of the Society after a brief transition 
period.

"I am pleased to announce that The Humane Society of the United States has 
named a dynamic, aggressive, and visionary leader to direct our domestic 
and global efforts to protect animals, to halt animal cruelty and abuse, 
and to protect their habitats," said David O. Wiebers, M.D., HSUS chair of 
the Board of Directors and a neurologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
"Wayne Pacelle has long been one of the nation's leading advocates of 
social reforms to benefit animals, and our Board of Directors recognized 
that we need a leader of his determination and inspiration in facing the 
challenges of the 21st century."

A senior vice president for The HSUS for the last 10 years, Pacelle has 
been instrumental in helping pass more than a dozen new federal laws to 
protect animals, more than 15 statewide ballot initiatives, and countless 
laws at the state level.  From toughening up laws for animal cruelty and 
animal fighting to outlawing the use of steel-jawed leghold traps and bear 
baiting to banning cruel industrial farming practices, Pacelle has led an 
unprecedented effort to protect millions of animals.  He has helped to 
secure millions in federal dollars for enforcement of federal laws to 
protect animals in the United States and abroad.

"The HSUS will continue to focus on protecting companion animals and 
wildlife, but we will make aggressive and unprecedented efforts to halt 
institutional forms of animal abuse, including the mistreatment of animals 
on industrial factory farms," said Pacelle. "In order to succeed, we need 
the participation of millions of Americans in our cause to root out 
suffering and abuse.  I want to invite every American who cares about 
animals to join with us in pursuing our important mission."

Pacelle joined the organization 10 years ago as vice president for 
government affairs and media and was promoted to senior vice president for 
communications and government affairs in 1998. He is the organization's 
leading spokesperson and has led a wide variety of campaigns for The HSUS. 
Pacelle previously served as executive director of The Fund for Animals,
the national advocacy group founded by author Cleveland Amory.  He 
graduated from Yale University in 1987 and is a native of New Haven, Conn.

The HSUS board of directors voted late Friday to appoint Pacelle to the 
position being vacated by Paul G. Irwin, who was asked by the board of 
directors to stay on beyond his planned retirement in 2002. "Paul Irwin has 
helped to build The Humane Society of the United States into the most 
influential animal advocacy organization in the world," said Dr. Wiebers. 
"One of every 40 Americans is a direct supporter of The HSUS thanks to his 
leadership.  We could not be more grateful to Paul for his extraordinary 
and expansive leadership."  Irwin joined The HSUS in 1976, and took over as 
president in 1992.
"Protecting animals has not only been a personal passion, but a moral 
imperative," stated Irwin.  "I could not be more proud of the work of The 
Humane Society of the United States in halting cruelty and exploitation 
across the globe.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to lead the 
organization for the past 14 years and to serve it in various other 
capacities for 28 years.  I will continue to stay engaged with the issues 
we address because they represent the core issues of humane and sustainable 
life on this planet."

Pacelle will announce other senior leadership changes in the organization 
in the coming weeks.

The Humane Society of the United States represents more than eight million 
members and constituents and has an annual budget in excess of $80 million. 
The organization has a staff of nearly 300 people working in the Washington 
area and in 10 regional offices across the country and in a number of 
offices throughout the world.  The HSUS maintains active programs in 
companion animals and equine protection, wildlife and habitat protection, 
animals in research, farm animals and sustainable agriculture, and national 
and international humane education and environmental protection.  The group 
is marking its 50th anniversary in 2004.

Lawmakers must put more teeth into the Animal Welfare
Act 

   A massive law enforcement sting operation in Barrow
County last week thrust the scourge of cockfighting
out of the shadows and into the forefront of public
attention.
   The April 18 raid on a Hancock Bridge Road farm
resulted in 238 arrests on misdemeanor charges of
animal cruelty and gambling. A couple leasing the
farm, Larry Otis Fleming Jr. and Misty Fleming, were
charged with felony-grade animal cruelty and gambling.
   Law enforcement officials believe the farm was a
venue for cockfights and dog fights with pit bull
terriers on most Sundays. The sting was the result of
an eight-month investigation by a handful of local,
state and federal police agencies.
   Many of those arrested were Mexican immigrants
hailing from states throughout the Southeast,
according to news reports. While legal in Mexico,
cockfighting is banned in the United States in every
state except Louisiana and New Mexico.
   In addition to seizing more than $130,000 in cash
during last week's bust, Barrow County officials also
took custody of nearly 140 fighting roosters and six
dogs.
   It was the second such raid on a major gambling and
animal fighting ring in Northeast Georgia this year.
More than 100 people were arrested in Newton County
during a dog-fighting sting in January.
   Illegal animal fighting is not a new phenomenon,
but in the past, it has been limited to small,
transient operations. The stings in Barrow and Newton
counties uncovered the illegal practice on a much
larger scale - more gamblers, more animals and more
money.
   Because animal fighting is often considered a
gateway crime - one which fosters other illegal
activities, such as drug and weapons trafficking - the
appearance of such large and brazen operations in our
region should be of concern to residents and public
officials.
   Not only do we need to fully enforce existing laws
against animal fighting, but these statutes should
also be reviewed to ensure they meet our needs.
   One area of federal law has been targeted for
reinforcement by law enforcement officials, animal
rights activists and poultry industry representatives.
They believe federal penalties outlined in the Animal
Welfare Act's fighting provisions aren't stiff enough
to prevent violations or encourage prosecution.
   Legislation now before Congress would help toughen
this regulation by increasing imprisonment terms from
one year to two. Supporters say the heightened
penalties are particularly important to curb the
illegal interstate transportation of dogs and birds
for fighting. The bill also would prohibit the
interstate sale or shipping of the razor-sharp spurs
attached to the legs of cockfighting birds.
   Though this measure has been in the works for
years, it has not been acted on yet in this Congress.
The delay certainly is not for lack of support. More
than 51 senators and 196 representatives are listed as
sponsors, and there are indications the Bush
administration also may back it.
   A recent endorsement by the National Chicken
Council, a poultry industry group, greatly improved
the legislation's chances. According to a statement on
the council's Web site, the bill will help reduce the
dangers associated with the unregulated trade of
fighting birds. The council believes the interstate
transport of these birds can lead to the spread of
avian diseases, such as Newcastle disease, an outbreak
of which could cripple the poultry industry.
   So far, Georgia's Sens. Zell Miller and Saxby
Chambliss and Rep. Max Burns have not signed on to
this valuable legislation. When this bill comes to a
vote, we hope our members of Congress will strongly
support it. If not, they need to be prepared to
explain why.
   Given the potential benefits to law enforcement as
well the extra protection afforded to Georgia's
valuable poultry industry, it's hard to fathom any
reason our leaders would oppose it.

Greetings to all Animal Protection Organizations.   
                
This project is about to close  and I need everyone who supports humane
education in our nation's
 schools to write a short note on letterhead if possible stating your
 support.  It can even be done via email now.  There are 3,000 animal
 related organizations in America and I'd hoped to have a majority. 
 So far, I've gotten just over 875 and clearly will not hit my goal by
 May 1 but would certainly like to have 1,000 letters if possible. 
 This will open doors for your organization as well since each state
 governor, each state legislative body and each state board of
 education will have a copy of your letter and be made aware of your
 efforts.
 
 We have one week left. Please send your letters and share this with
 others. Thank you so much.
 America CARES Coalition is an active participation of groups and
 individuals who 'think outside the box' in order to see the necessary
 improvements in today's animal protection efforts.
 
 
 
 
              
             Dear Animal Rights, Animal Protection and Animal Welfare
 organizations, Teachers and Parents,
 
             1-America CARES will do the actual mailing
 
             2-Your organization only need to send a letter via email
 to be included
 
             3-Read the cover letter below and see a sample letter of
 what we hope yours will say.
              
             "Recognizing that each individual organization would
 ultimately hope for the implementation of humane education programs
 in our nation's schools as well as the elimination of all political
 aspects that have prevented our efforts from moving further towards
 our goals, the America CARES Coalition has taken on the following
 project.  Realizing that each organization has their own goals and
 objectives that should be pursued in the way they see fit, this
 letter is only to show the 50 states' governors, legislators and
 board of educations, that we (all animal welfare, animal rights and
 animal protection organizations regardless of size) can stand
 together on one issue in agreement.  The signatures will be listed by
 organizational name in an alpha numerical order so as not to give any
 single participant extra 'weight' or notoriety among the remaining
 signatures.  We also realize that there is so much more that needs to
 be said, done and done in a variety of ways, but this letter is
 specifically written in very simple terms to eliminate the political
 wrangling as well as to show them, and well as ourselves, that it is
 possible for everyone to agree on something in a very public display
 of unity towards our nation's schools and the implementation of
 humane education  into the curriculum by the year 2010. By sending a
 simple letter with a definitive statement, this will show the vast
 number of voters and citizens that truly have an interest in seeing
 humane education included into our nation's schools. It is a letter
 to affect change. Each organization should continue to pursue their
 noble efforts in the way they have successfully established prior to
 this.  How each state implements this is the individual states'
 decision.   This will provide all organizations an opportunity to
 pursue the states with their ideas of how it could be included and
 under given guidelines guidelines."

Activists monitoring the hunt say it's not, and use video of hunters to make 
their point. Canada says it is, citing a report by animal vets to back its 
position and noting that officials are ready and able to crack down on any 
inhumane hunters.

Most hunting is for young pups, whose pelts fetch more on international 
markets than seals more than a few months old. Canada's biggest reform was a 
ban on hunting pups before they shed their white fur, usually about 12 days. 
Images of those cuddly pups became icons of the 1970s protests against the 
hunt, which takes place on ice floes across eastern Canada.

The debate today comes down to this: Do the young seals die a quick, humane 
death before hunters skin them?

'Swimming reflex?'
Roger Simon, who oversees the hunt for Canada's Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, says activist video purportedly showing seals being skinned alive is 
actually showing unconscious or dead seals going through a "swimming reflex" 
&#x2014; involuntary movements that mimic swimming. It's akin, he says, to seeing 
the final seconds of a chicken running with its head cut off.

"It's impossible to skin a live seal, or a conscious one," he says. "Can you 
imagine trying to skin a live animal ... it would scream and claw."

Besides, he adds, why would you "when you can kill it in one second."

The International Fund for Animal Welfare, which has monitored the hunts for 
years, counters that hunters often are in such a hurry that they club or 
shoot as many as possible before going back to check their condition and 
skin them.

"Mr. Simon cannot dismiss every instance simply with reference to a swimming 
reflex," says IFAW science advisor David Lavigne, a former zoology professor 
at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.

Video turned over to Canada shows scenes like "pups being skinned alive and 
reacting by doing things like lifting up their heads and crying in pain or 
trying to grab the knife with their front paws," Lavigne says. "These 
behaviors are not a swimming reflex, these are wounded animals. This year we 
filmed one seal, left wounded in a pile of dead seals, crying out for nearly 
an hour while sealers stood nearby."


Simon doesn't doubt that incident but adds "you cannot describe the whole 
industry based on one observation. The fact that some people commit 
violations is the reason we have fishery officers, helicopters, and 
surveillance vessels out there to enforce the regulations.

"If you see a video where a pitcher is trying to bean a hitter would you 
conclude that this is a fair portrayal of Major League Baseball," he asks. 
Canada's 12,000 seal hunters should "be judged on the vast majority of 
sealers doing their job properly, not on some selected clips from a video."

Canada has issued 322 violations over the previous five years, most of them 
for small infractions.

The activists say that in that time they've documented on video what they 
feel are 660 serious violations of Canada's marine mammal rules.

IFAW adds that, while it would prefer to see all hunting stop, it would be 
satisfied with what it considers compliance with the law. "A subsidized hunt 
for baby animals is like paying people to kill kittens with a claw hammer," 
says IFAW spokesman Chris Cutter, "we are simply asking Canada to abide by 
and enforce its own rules. ... "A quick death is much preferred if that's 
inevitable."

Vets' reports
Skinning live seals would violate Canada's marine mammal rules as well as 
its criminal code, which makes it a crime to willfully cause "unnecessary 
pain, suffering or injury to an animal or bird."</docText>

SEQUIM &#x2014; When elk amble across Highway 101 in Sequim on the Olympic 
Peninsula, radio collars around their necks set off flashing lights up and 
down the busy road.
A continent away, when moose wander across Route 4 in the mountains of 
western Maine, their hulking bodies break an infrared beam that triggers 
flashing lights on moose-warning signs.

On re-engineered highways between the wireless elk and the beam-breaking 
moose, there are underpasses for tortoises in California, 
vibration-detectors for deer in Wyoming and a 52-foot-wide overpass for 
deer, foxes, coyotes and opossums on Interstate 75 in Florida.

At an accelerating pace, federal and state highways across much of the 
United States are being tricked out with critter-crossing technology, high 
and low. It is an attempt to halt a rising tide of roadkill, the grisly 
result of more cars, more sprawl and a continentwide resurgence of large 
hoofed animals, including deer, elk and &#x2014; deadliest of all &#x2014; moose.

The scale of the nation's roadkill and highway-ecology problem is attracting 
attention after decades of being ignored by highway engineers and 
regional-planning agencies, said Richard Forman, a professor of ecology at 
Harvard.

"We have come a long way since the mid-1990s, when there was a pitiful 
amount of information," he said. "Thinking about road ecology is now 
permeating state departments of transportation in a very positive way."

That thinking has reached Congress. For the first time, the Senate version 
of a pending transportation bill would require all state transportation 
departments to consult fish-and-game agencies from the beginning of planning 
for roads built with federal money. Also, for the first time, the Senate 
bill considers wildlife crossings to be a major safety issue and would 
allocate federal money for fences, overpasses and other ways of reducing 
roadkill.

5.4.04 - One of the two men convicted for his part in killing a Kenwood horse 
by running it down and hitting it with his car is now seeking a new trial.

Deputy Public Defender Steve Speigleman, attorney for Noel Guido-Silva, 21, 
filed a motion with the Sonoma County Superior Court earlier this month asking 
for a new trial on the animal- cruelty charge. 
The motion, which alleges the judge improperly instructed jurors on how the 
laws on animal cruelty applied in the case, has caused Guido-Silva's sentencing 
hearing to be postponed until some time after May 4, when arguments on the 
motion for a new trial have been scheduled. Guido-Silva was supposed to have 
been sentenced last month.

Despite repeated attempts to contact Speigleman for comment, he did not 
return calls. 
Deputy District Attorney James Patrick Casey dismissed the motion as an 
improper interpretation of the law and said he suspects that it is a stalling 
tactic being used by Guido-Silva's attorney to reduce the amount of time he will 
have to serve in state prison.

Guido-Silva was convicted of animal cruelty, trespassing, hit-and-run driving 
and vandalism by a Sonoma County jury on March 23 after a 2-1/2 week trial. 
He was acquitted of a conspiracy charge in which prosecutors argued that he and 
co-defendant Liobijildo Guzman Herrera chased the horse with the intent to 
kill it.

The environment, we are told, comprises our surroundings. One's surroundings 
include the totality of flora and fauna that influence one in spite of 
himself. Those that live in coastal town or the littoral states will, doubtless, be 
influenced by those features that are associated with riverine areas-the 
luxuriant vegetation, the beautiful landscape aesthetically pleasing. Those that 
live in the tropics are usually under tropical influences. What I am trying to 
say is that what influences one in a given time is dependent on the prevailing 
elements in action.
But wait a minute! What is the nexus between the environment and corruption, 
which this article is proposed to discuss? Just like the environment, our 
surroundings influence our every day life. We can equally talk in terms of 
environmental influence on the administrative life of individuals and countries. 
When, for example, we talk about physical conditions that we work in, we can as 
well call it work environment just as we talk in terms of political, financial, 
moral and social environments. Just like the influence of the environment on 
our lives, we have environmental influences on corruption, that is, the state 
of affairs that encourages and sustains corruption.
As a matter of fact, we are all humans, both black and white, but 
contemporary observations show that the blacks, especially Africans are more susceptible 
to corruption. When you ponder over this susceptibility, you are inclined to 
think whether there are innate brain peculiarities that condition the two races 
the way they are. After much research, and considering the equally epochal 
achievements by the blacks, we now know that nature bestows equally on every 
human being. We are the way we are due to many factors, predominantly 
environmental.
The salaries paid to workers in developed countries are enough to support 
decent life. In developing countries the salaries cannot even support the life of 
frugal comfort. Thus, workers in this part of the world must necessarily look 
elsewhere to make ends meet. In looking elsewhere, some take to robbery, 
while there are some that do not resist the lure of corruption insofar as it will 
better their lot. Such states of affairs that make corruption to thrive are 
the environmental elements of corruption.
Talking about crimes in the society, the current debate is whether death 
penalty should be abolished or not. When viewed critically, you will discover that 
the magnitude of punishment do not necessarily stop people from committing 
crimes. The name of the game is survival; to some people it must be at all 
costs. The fact to note is that people do not often contemplate the punishment 
awaiting them should they be caught committing crimes; they do not even bear 
thinking the possibility of being caught. Thus, in reducing crime, the emphasis 
should be on encouraging the blossoming of the environment that will not 
encourage crimes. When people are comfortable, when workers receive living 
salaries/wages, when employment is provided, crimes will reduce.
The same applies to corruption. The basic remedy to corruption is by 
encouraging the blossoming of healthy environment that will not encourage corruption. 
If policemen were well paid, they will certainly consider the extortion of 
N20.00 from motorists as infradig. The same applies, mutatis mutantur, to other 
professions/workers whose nature of job expose them to corruption.

WASHINGTON ? The byproducts of a Texas cow that was destroyed after it
showed potential signs of a central nervous disorder must be made into pig
feed or be destroyed, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. 

The FDA said it tracked down all the material from the cow that was sent
to a processor for rendering into animal feed and other products. All the
material is being held by a business that the agency did not name. The
government has said that none of it got into the human food supply.

The cow was destroyed before it could be tested for mad cow disease, an
incurable illness that eats holes in the brain, attacking the central
nervous system.

In diet books, bacon is often maligned as the antithesis of healthy
eating. But among followers of the popular Atkins diet, it's hard to find
anyone tearing a strip off the sizzle.

Brian Burko is an Atkins-diet devotee who swears by his menu of six slices
of bacon, four or five times a week.

"It doesn't really look like I'm on some terrible diet but over the last
few months I've lost 35 pounds eating this way," he told CTV News.
...
Mad cow disease and avian flu may partially explain why consumers are
turning to pork, and away from beef and chicken.

But many believe the key ingredient is the craze for Atkins-inspired
low-carb, high protein diets, and the notion that fat is good again.

Farm Aid has become a shrill voice for "specific" farming practices.

The mid-1980s was a dark time for rural America. Crop, livestock and land
prices plummeted, creating a financial strain for many farmers. Some
survived and remained in agriculture, some didn't. Neighbors watched
neighbors go broke. Some farmers contemplated suicide - and even worse,
committed it. No one was left untouched by the difficulties.
...
Today, Farm Aid plays on. But don't be fooled by nostalgia and former
number-one songs. Quietly and discreetly, Farm Aid has become a shrill
voice for "specific" farming practices. Participating musicians gladly
pose for the cameras wearing the familiar, red "Stop Factory Farms" shirts
while raising millions to fund objectionable activities and organizations.

For example, Farm Aid condemns "factory farming," an emotional phrase
activists love to use but never define. On the web, Farm Aid provides
links to numerous animal rights groups including Farm Sanctuary and the
Animal Welfare Institute. Farm Aid also uses the "Mad Cow" issue to push
organic food sales, despises genetically enhanced food and blames modern
food production for childhood obesity, food-borne illnesses and antibiotic
resistance.

These days, mad cow disease is ever with us, so I was off to lunch to meet
John Stauber, who's been described by "Fast Food Nation'' author Eric
Schlosser as "[one] of America's bravest, finest journalists."

And, since Stauber earned this accolade in part by co-writing "Mad Cow U.
S.A.," a book that, seven years ago, warned we weren't doing nearly enough
to prevent mad cow disease in this country, I was meeting him at Greens. 
...
"Mad Cow U.S.A." went out of print, but Stauber and Rampton decided to
make it available as a free download. Then came Dec. 23, 2003, the day mad
cow disease was found in the United States, and over the course of the
next month or so, the book was downloaded 80,000 times.

And Stauber -- who sends out periodic mad cow e-mail updates, though he
and Rampton have also just released a new book, "Banana Republicans" --
believes much more has to be done. "You may not be a vegetarian, but the
animals you eat need to be," he said. "We're still not following that axiom."

A UK scientific expert in horse breeding has accused the government of
giving in to animal rights activists after it rejected his bid on cloning.

Professor Twink Allen applied for a licence to clone horses a year ago but
was turned down by the Home Office.

The world's first cloned horse was born subsequently in Italy in August.

Companies with clients facing protests from groups like animal rights
activists should stand up to their agitators, rather than dump their
difficult customers, according to a senior investment community figure.
...
Although many such companies suffer these attacks, the move was prompted
by recent action from Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) against
Huntingdon Life Sciences animal laboratory and its service providers.

Among its victims was Big Four firm Deloitte, which withdrew as
Huntingdon's auditors last year following intense protest from the group.
SHAC is currently on the trail of new auditor Hugh Scott, whose details
have been deliberately obscured.

 Distraught family members flew to the exclusive Lion Sands Lodge in 
Mpumalanga on Wednesday after an elephant trampled senior ecologist Kay 
Hiscocks to death on Tuesday. 
Hiscocks' father flew into the Sabi Sands reserve from Durban on Wednesday 
morning to visit the scene of his 42-year-old daughter's death. 
Hiscocks, the only full-time ecologist on the 65 000-hectare Sabi Sands, was 
killed when an adult elephant cow cornered and trampled her 40 metres from the 
world-famous lodge. Hiscocks, who held a certificate in 'dangerous game 
theory', was reportedly trying to herd the cow and two bull elephants away from the 
lodge at the time. 
"Kay was an impeccable professional, whose passion shone through everything 
she did here over the past 10 years. This tragic incident was an unavoidable 
accident, but Kay died doing what she loved most," said Lion Sands' shocked 
co-owner, Nicholas More, on Wednesday. 
More stressed that Sabi Sands warden Gavin Hulett was conducting a full 
investigation into the incident, but had already described the death as an 
"unavoidable and extremely unfortunate accident". 
The elephant cow, which only turned on Hiscocks after allowing itself to be 
herded almost 30 metres, was wounded three times by Lion Sands ranger Izak de 
Villiers shortly after the attack when shocked staff tried to drive the angry 
animal off. 
"[Hulett] was immediately informed, and after establishing that the elephant 
posed a risk to guests and staff ... it was destroyed," said More.

WASHINGTON -- Kentucky Derby devotees and other horse fans are rounding up 
support in Congress to stop the slaughter of U.S. horses that would grace 
gourmet dinner plates in Japan, Belgium and France. 
Americans, who have a special love for the animal that carried pioneers into 
the Wild West, U.S. soldiers into battle and jockeys into racetrack history, 
are finding the notion of grilled horse steak and horse meat sushi extremely 
distasteful. 
When you watch a thoroughbred pulling ahead on the back stretch, remember 
that "the winner could be some Frenchman's entree," said Rep. John Sweeney, 
R-N.Y., chairman of the Congressional Horse Caucus, who has collected 209 
co-sponsors on a bill to ban the slaughter or export of U.S. horses for human 
consumption. 
"We view horses as athletes and entertainers," Sweeney said. "The American 
psyche is shocked by the notion that we are going to so inhumanely treat such an 
important part of our culture." 
Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., a veterinarian who introduced a matching bill in 
the Senate last week, called the slaughter for human consumption of nearly 
50,000 of the nation's 7 million horses last year "barbaric." 
To draw attention to the equine issue, Sweeney and actress Bo Derek, who rode 
to fame on horseback in the movie 10, combed the halls of Capitol Hill last 
week and plan to do so again this week. Also lobbying lawmakers are actor Tony 
Curtis and his wife, Jill, who founded a horse rescue farm in Las Vegas. 
Derek, an avid rider, says she was "shocked to find out that horses are being 
slaughtered not for countries that have a famine, but for gourmet meals." 
"We're giving these magnificent animals a hideous death," Derek said in an 
interview. "No one knows it's happening." 
Curtis said he started to love horses when he began his film career. 
"The history of horses on our continent is extraordinary," Curtis said. "We 
wouldn't have discovered America the way we did without horses." 
U.S. soldiers and some civilians ate horse meat during World War II when beef 
was scarce, but now virtually all of U.S. slaughtered horse meat is shipped 
to Europe, primarily Belgium, France and Switzerland, as well as Russia and 
Mexico. 
While a dozen horse slaughter plants dotted this country 20 years ago, now 
there are just two in Texas, the Dallas Crown firm in Kaufman and Beltex Corp. 
in Fort Worth. Another horse-meat plant, Cavel International, is under 
construction in DeKalb, Ill., which has catapulted the issue into the state 
legislature. 
Texas banned horse slaughter for human consumption in 1949, but the law was 
never enforced. 
In 2002, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, now a Republican U.S. 
senator, issued an opinion saying that the 1949 law outlawing the sale, possession 
and transfer of horse meat for human consumption was still in effect. Tarrant 
County has filed suit in federal court to close the slaughterhouses. 
John Linebarger, an attorney representing both Texas slaughterhouses, said a 
lot of the horses are unwanted and sold to the plants for an average of $300 
to $400. 
"Some people would otherwise let these things die in the fields and rot," 
Linebarger said. 
Linebarger said horseflesh is very lean and is lower in cholesterol and fat 
than white meat chicken, which is why many Japanese and European physicians 
recommend it. 
"Horses aren't bred as a food item and so they aren't filled with hormones 
and chemicals," Linebarger said.

OPINION -- Exposing environmental programs usually brings an attack from
the green direction. Their usual tactic is to intimidate and belittle the
writer. Greens hate for the general public to know their real agenda -
which is to control all property - on land and water.
...
Trent Loos of Faces of Agriculture, doesn't let the environmentalists stop
him, he says "bring 'em on." Loos exposes PETA, Sierra Club and other
environmental organizations and how they affect agriculture. In a recent
article by Loos, he spoke about organizations who use Farm Aid money to
sue farmers.

"Farm Aid's website includes photos and statements from Farm Sanctuary, a
group that promotes a vegan and vegetarian lifestyle. Farm Sanctuary put
the only two pig farmers in Florida out of business by promoting a law
that bans individual animal housing units for sows. They are currently
supporting legislation in New Jersey and California to put more family
farms out of business," reported Loos.
...
Loos says "To top it off, Country Music Television (CMT) recently ran a
Farm Aid documentary. Listed in the credits was none other than "Voice for
Animals," an animal rights group who's main goal is animal liberation."

        <docText>Come Wednesday night we'll find out just who has the real 
political muscle at the Legislature -- the hogs or the chickens.

The hogs have the upper hand so far. Rep. Warren Triche's bill that would 
outlaw violent ''hog-dog'' events in which pit bulls are set upon de-tusked boars 
was passed by the House of Representatives 75-25 last week and was sent to 
the Senate, where a procedural effort to derail it was defeated Thursday 
afternoon. 
Rep. Karen Carter's measure to outlaw cockfighting hasn't even had a 
committee hearing yet in the House; and there's a widespread feeling on the House 
floor that it won't get out of the House Agriculture Committee, which is scheduled 
to debate it Wednesday night.

Both bills are aimed at events that various animal welfare groups say are 
barbaric and cruel, but there's a definite dichotomy at work here: Triche only 
got his bill passed after fighting off an attempt to amend the anti-cockfighting 
language into it.

Times Online
From my experience, I suspect that it is not often the case that ?vivisection 
labs cause pain and misery . . .? (Jonathan Balcombe, Debate, April 29). It 
is, however, only the Home Office that has the facts that could impartially 
inform the public on such details, and it might be a helpful contribution to 
public understanding if the annual reports on the working of the Act were to 
include summarised data to confirm or refute such assertions. 


My impression is that the majority of licenced work involves little more than 
the feeding or other administration of exogenous substances, the withdrawal 
of biological samples (most commonly blood) for chemical and haematological 
analysis, and painless euthanasia so that tissue samples can be systematically 
examined post-mortem. Such procedures are not truthfully described by your 
correspondents? assertions. Indeed, the majority of procedures involve little more 
than trivial or fleeting discomfort to animals that are kept under conditions 
of exemplary housing and husbandry. 
While there is always room for critical discussion of the value and relevance 
of animal research to human physiology and disease, there can be no 
justification for misleading the public about what actually happens to animals that are 
used in biomedical research. There should be provision for more detailed 
public information to provide a factual basis for deciding whether things that 
happen in vivisection laboratories are ?unspeakable?, or not.

The giant panda has served its purpose, says Richard Leakey, the grand old 
man of African wildlife. We need a new international icon to represent 
threatened species, and he knows what it should be: an image of the great apes.
The precipitous decline of the gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos (pygmy 
chimpanzees) and orang-utans is the most urgent of all the world's conservation 
problems, says the man who 15 years ago highlighted the poaching threat to the 
elephant by setting fire to a stockpile of ivory in Kenya.
"I'm not suggesting for a moment there are no problems with the panda, or 
with the elephant," he says. "I just think the great apes problem is far greater. 
Switching the focus from the panda to the great apes as an icon for 
threatened, endangered species, would send a very loud and important message to the 
world."
At 59, Mr Leakey is perhaps the most celebrated of white Africans. A Kenyan 
politician, civil servant and conservationist, he is a silver-haired 
Hemingway-like figure who lost both his legs in an air crash in 1993 and who now walks 
on artificial limbs with no crutches, but a sailor's rolling gait.
The son of the palaeontologist Louis Leakey, who discovered man's oldest 
fossil remains in the Olduvai gorge of what is now Tanzania, Richard Leakey is a 
third-generation Kenyan who began in palaeontology himself and achieved 
eminence, but switched in his middle years to conservation, to achieve more eminence 
still.
He ran the Kenyan Wildlife Service from 1989 to 1994, taking a tough line 
with poachers, then left government to found an opposition political party, 
SAFINA, becoming public enemy number one for the Kenyan president, Daniel arap Moi.
He returned to Moi's government to run the civil service as Secretary to the 
Cabinet - "I thought I would try to change things from the inside" - before 
resigning in frustration. But his commitment to wildlife conservation remains 
undimmed, and now the great apes are his primary focus.
He is in London preparing for a fund-raising dinner a fortnight on Monday, at 
which he will appeal to the British Government to add the plight of the great 
apes to its professed concerns for Africa, emphasised this week with the 
launching of the Commission for Africa by Prime Minister Tony Blair.

        <docText>A Spearfish man who owns and operates a specialty meat business 
has been sentenced to serve one year on probation and pay a $3,000 fine, along 
with $8,320 in restitution, for illegally selling bear gall bladders.

Steve Hauff, 50, was sentenced by U.S. Senior District Judge Richard H. 
Battey on April 27. Hauff was originally indicted by a federal grand jury on a 
felony charge more than two years ago, in December 2002, and pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor last October.
The misdemeanor charge holds that Hauff should have known the laws involving 
bear gall bladder sales, explained Bob Prieksat, resident agent in charge for 
the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service in Pierre. A felony charge would have 
required that he did know the laws.

Hauff, who founded Prairie Harvest in 1997, was charged with selling bear 
gall bladders to a party in Alaska and with making a false statement in a 
wildlife report after an investigation by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, according 
to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

For the past two decades, Charles Blair and his wife, Jane, have come to
the Cole Brothers Circus' stop in Annapolis to witness a tradition as old
as the circus itself: elephants raising the big top.

Yesterday morning, however, the couple - in their 80s - watched in
confusion as dozens of workers lifted the colossal red tent above the
dusty circus grounds at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium.

"I even brought peanuts for the elephants," said Charles Blair, pulling a
brown paper bag out of his pocket. "But someone just told us that there
aren't any this year."

Faced with dwindling audiences, sliding profits and increased pressure
from animal rights organizations, traveling circuses, including Cole
Brothers, New York's Big Apple Circus and Missouri's Circus Flora, have
sent their elephants into early retirement - canning one of the most
costly acts for such shows to maintain.

"In the next 10 years, we think even zoos may no longer have elephants,"
said Bob Johnson, president and chief executive officer of the Outdoor
Amusement Business Association, which represents more than 4,000 circuses,
carnivals and other acts in the United States and Canada. "I'm as
disappointed as the little kids who come out to see them."

The feed ration that goes into a feed bunk, trough or bucket has an important 
impact on animal health, but can also impact human health down the road. 
That's why the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Land O' Lakes Farmland Feeds 
and the Wisconsin Agri-Service Association are teaming up to hold four upcoming 
feed safety meetings to discuss protecting animal and human health through 
proper feed handling and mixing. 
The meetings, offered at no-charge, are an opportunity for feed mill 
operators, mill managers, and on-farm feed mixers to learn more about medicated feed, 
proper feed labeling, good manufacturing practices, federal feed restrictions 
and requirements, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. 
"Wisconsin's animal feed industry has a key responsibility not only for the 
health of our food animals like dairy and beef cattle, poultry, swine, and 
sheep but that responsibility carries over to human health," explained Eric 
Nelson, state agriculture department feed specialist. "Following proper feed 
manufacturing practices can greatly reduce the risk of transmitting diseases, drug 
residues or chemical contaminants into the human food chain." 
The sessions will cover topics such as preventing feed contamination; state 
and federal feed regulations; feed labeling requirements; proper use of animal 
drugs; emerging issues and feed compliance cases. A question and answer period 
will be part of the program.

Someone found a puppy suffering from bad wounds to his neck in Jasper County, 
and investigators want to know who did it. The now happy-looking puppy is 
anywhere from three to five months old, but for most of his life he's been 
wearing a collar much too small, leaving a deep gouge around his neck. 
"The sad fact is his skin grew around the collar which created a great deal 
of infection, loss of blood supply, and some pretty significant secondary 
complications," said Stacy O'Quinn, a veterinarian with the Riverwalk Animal 
Hospital.
O'Quinn took the puppy in Wednesday, when Jasper County Animal Control first 
found him. She says it's not the worst case of animal abuse she's seen, but 
this puppy's hurt pretty bad. 
Today, veterinarians are going to take the dog into surgery. They're going to 
have to cut off clumps of dead skin and basically sew his neck back together.
"This is a situation where somebody put a collar on a dog that was young and 
they either neglected or forgot they had a dog or the dog got loose and was 
not approached for some time, and obviously dogs can grow and collars can't 
grow," said O'Quinn.

The female tri-colored beagle had no name but she bore the tag number 37984. 
A pair of lacerations crossed her right hip, an inch long, the other an inch 
and a half. On her left hip was another laceration, along with a puncture 
wound. An area of painful swelling extended from her right hip to her rib cage. 
Another area of painful swelling on her right shoulder ruptured at the touch of 
an examiner and emitted a stream of yellow-green pus. 
Failure to provide proper veterinary care for dog number 37984 is one of more 
than 1,000 violations of the Animal Welfare Act allegedly committed by 
Chester C. (C.C.) Baird, his wife and two daughters through their Williford 
businesses, Martin Creek Kennels and Pat?s Pine Tree Farms. The Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) filed the 108-page complaint March 11 before the 
United States Department of Agriculture. 
Named as respondents in the complaint are C.C. Baird, his wife, Patsy Baird, 
and their two daughters, Jeanette Baird and Patricia Baird. 
APHIS cites examples of animal dehydration, malnutrition, infections, 
injuries and abrasions, swelling, inflamed skin, lameness, lethargy, mange, flea 
infestations and other conditions, and accuses the Bairds of failing to provide 
proper veterinary care for the animals? conditions. 
The Bairds, who hold a class B (random source animal dealer) license, have 
made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling dogs and cats to research 
facilities. But they face more than $1 million in fines for the alleged violations.

Despite two attacks on horses within two weeks, Stanford University 
officials said Tuesday they will not ask the state for permission to shoot 
the assailant, believed to be a mountain lion living in the foothills 
surrounding the campus.

Instead, the university has posted guards at all four entrances to the 
popular Dish trail, warning hikers and joggers about the latest incidents, 
which occurred on April 23 and May 1.

"We want to proceed with caution -- it's a safety issue,'' said Jeffrey 
Wachtel, senior assistant to the university president.

Both horses sustained deep gashes and were terrified but are recovering. The 
incidents happened within a mile and a half of the Dish trail on land the 
university leases to horse boarders and farmers.

Officials left open the possibility that something other than a cougar 
attacked the horses. While the injuries are consistent with a mountain lion 
attack, officials noted that there have been no confirmed sightings. In 
addition, the first attack occurred in the middle of the day, an unusual 
time for mountain lions to be on the prowl.

Legally, the university could get a permit from the state to shoot an animal 
that preys on livestock. Absent a request from the university, the 
California Department of Fish and Game has no plans to take action, said 
spokesman Steve Martarano.

If the animal becomes an imminent threat to public safety, law enforcement 
officers can shoot it, but Martarano said that seems unlikely.

In an unusual verdict in favor of city police, a jury has rejected a
lawsuit claiming that city cops used unreasonable force during an anti-fur
protest at Neiman Marcus four years ago.

Attorney Derek St. Pierre, who was at the protest as a legal observer for
the National Lawyers Guild, sued The City, claiming that three officers
falsely arrested him and used excessive force during a clash between cops
and demonstrators at the Jan. 16, 2000 rally.

Police were called to the upscale Dallas-based department store on
Stockton Street after protesters from the Animal Liberation Front, as well
as other groups, locked themselves to the store with cast-iron pipes, wire
and duct tape. The protest came at a time of frequent clashes between cops
and anti-fur demonstrators, who were accused of smashing the store's
windows and who regularly picketed the store with "fur is murder" signs.

The head of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on Thursday noted a possible link between a condemned cow
in Texas and eight-year-old animal feed that was not protected against mad
cow disease.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday acknowledged it erred in
failing to test a cow for the brain-wasting disease when it arrived at a
south-central Texas slaughterhouse possibly exhibiting a central nervous
system disorder.

        <docText>New Jersey health officials Friday will
likely rule out any connection between 17 human deaths and mad cow
disease, UPI has learned.

The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services will present their
final report on an investigation into the deaths that prompted fears of a
mad cow disease connection, but the indications are that authorities have
ruled out any link to tainted meat, said Llelwyn Grant, spokesman for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which assisted in the
investigation.

Pulaski Police Officer Tim Wroda said he intends to find out who put three
Australian Shepherd puppies, ropes tied tightly around their necks, inside
a plastic garbage bag and left them to die at a remote dumpster on the
campus of Martin Methodist College.

One of the puppies, a female, survived, but her two brothers died of
suffocation. A student found the bag and carried the dogs to the Giles
County Animal Hospital and Donna Dixon, president of Adoptable Angels, a
non-profit group that helps abandoned animals.

An iguana enjoys its new home at the Washington County Humane Society 
Thursday, after being rescued from a Germantown apartment where officials found 300 
animals, including 76 ducks, a pair of alligators, scorpions, tarantulas, 150 
mice and several snakes, including an anaconda and a python.


GERMANTOWN - 
State conservation warden William Mitchell said he has never seen - or 
smelled - anything like it in his 31 years as a state wildlife warden.
Tuesday night, local authorities followed their noses and found nearly 300 
animals and numerous carcasses in a village apartment at W162 N11651 Park Avenue 
leased by the girlfriend of a Milwaukee area man who has twice been cited for 
similar incidents involving illegal animals.
??Smelly. Very smelly. The smell was just unbelievable,?? Mitchell said.
In a freezer, he said he found frozen carcasses of "two raccoons, a gray 
squirrel, two cottontail rabbits and a raccoon pelt."

Domestic ducks and wild mallards were also living in the apartment. Droppings 
covered the floor, Mitchell said.
??It was really stinking. ... It made my eyes water,?? Mitchell said.
More than 70 ducks in a basement pen were only part of the menagerie 
Germantown police found in the apartment when other residents complained of the stench.
Germantown police called Mitchell to the apartment at 10 p.m. after getting a 
9:30 p.m. complaint from the building?s landlord about the foul odor and odd 
noises, said Police Chief Peter Hoell. Eventually up to five police officers 
were involved in the investigation Tuesday night, he said.
Marnie Brown, executive director of the Washington County Humane Society, 
said with help from the Elmbrook Humane Society and a vet from Milwaukee Area 
Domestic Animal Control, 76 ducks, two game birds, two alligators, six snakes, 10 
turtles, an African frog and other frogs, a few geckos, an iguana, three 
tarantulas, three scorpions and well over 150 mice and rats were collected.
"All together, there were close to 300 critters in there," Brown said, 
including an anaconda and a python.
Decaying animal carcasses were found in an adjacent garage.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The fate of the San Francisco Zoo's two surviving elephants 
brought heated debate to a Board of Supervisors City Services Committee 
meeting this morning. 
Two elephants at the zoo have died in the past two months heightening 
concerns from animal activists and zoo officials about the well-being of the other 
elephants living on zoo grounds. 
Both sides are in agreement that the elephants named Lulu and Tinkerbelle 
should be relocated to a larger outdoor facility where the animals will have more 
room to roam. 
Newly hired Zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo announced the zoo's intention to 
move the elephants at today's meeting and said the elephants would probably only 
return to the zoo if a greatly expanded facility for them could be 
constructed. 
Mollinedo said he would like to see the remaining elephants moved within the 
next six months, pending approval of a new home by the American Zoo and 
Aquarium Association. 
According to Mollinedo, the association's approval is necessary in order for 
the zoo to remain accredited. 
Activists, including members of In Defense of Animals and the city's Animal 
Control and Welfare Commission, took issue with the zoo's six-month time frame, 
and with the zoo's willingness to let the AZAA choose the elephants' new 
home. 
Board President Matt Gonzalez, explaining the activists' point of view, said 
that there is "a sense of urgency" about the issue, because many feel that 
conditions at the zoo led to the other elephants' premature deaths and could lead 
to the same fate for the remaining two.

CALGARY -- Three Canadian slaughterhouses were found in contempt of 
Parliament yesterday for refusing to give financial documents to a committee probing 
allegations that beef packers gouged ranchers to rake in huge profits during the 
mad-cow crisis.
In an unusual move, MPs voted unanimously to find Cargill Foods, Lakeside 
Packers and Levinoff Meats guilty of contempt for ignoring the committee on 
agriculture and agrifoods' repeated requests for records and extended the deadline 
-- for a third and final time -- to Monday at noon.
"If they've got nothing to hide, then they should be forthcoming," said 
committee member Dick Proctor, a New Democrat from Saskatchewan.
This little-used sanction could mean fines and even jail time for miscreants.
It was last handed to disgraced former privacy commissioner George Radwanski 
in November for misleading the House of Commons, but he avoided the penalty 
after making a last-minute apology.The last time the measure was used with any 
real impact was in 1913, when a parliamentary committee witness was sent to 
jail for refusing to answer questions.
"It's not punishment we're seeking, it's compliance," committee chairman and 
Liberal MP Paul Steckle said.
Federal and provincial governments pledged about $2.5-billion in aid to help 
beef producers in the wake of last year's discovery of a single case of bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy, better known as BSE or mad-cow disease, but cattle 
prices still plummeted while the cost of meat at the grocery store didn't 
fall.
"Something is not right. All we want is some answers," Mr. Steckle said. ". . 
. Some farmers have literally had their animals stolen from them."

A greyhound, with a hole in its head and both ears missing, was found dumped 
alive on a mountainside, it emerged today.

The RSPCA branded the incident ?barbaric? and said the ?deeply distressed? 
animal may have been a racing dog, which would have had tattooed ears to 
identify it.

The black and white greyhound was found by a member of the public who was 
walking a pet on a mountainside between Fochriw and Bargoed n the Rhymney Valley, 
south Wales, last Sunday. It was taken to a vet by a dog warden and put down.

RSPCA inspector Simon Evans said: ?This is a shocking, horrific incident; the 
greyhound had suffered immensely. He was put to sleep after experiencing 
unimaginable pain and distress.

?Whoever carried out this barbaric act may have thought the dog was already 
dead when they dumped him. I believe the culprit chose the location very 
carefully, hoping the greyhound would never be found.

GRAND JUNCTION - Hunters took their best shots at Colorado wildlife 
commissioners Thursday in a battle with two contentious fronts: the right of residents 
versus nonresidents to pursue big game, and the decision to provide a limited 
versus unlimited number of hunting licenses.
"We are very concerned about losing jobs and the impact this will have on the 
state's economy," Randy Horne of the Northwest Colorado Outfitters 
Association told members of the Colorado Wildlife Commission.
Horne spoke during public testimony regarding policies that include limiting 
the number of elk hunters so more trophy-sized bull elk can grow in Colorado's 
game management units.
"What is a trophy?" Horne asked rhetorically. "A trophy is in the eye of the 
beholder. If we only manage for numbers and inches, I have to ask the trophy 
hunters, 'Where does it end?'"
Montrose hunter Roy Misenar disagreed with the economic argument for 
providing extensive big-game hunting licenses.
"We put a dollar sign on these animals," Misenar said. "People say, 'It's 
going to hurt my business (if the state reduces hunting license numbers), 
therefore.' Therefore what? These animals don't owe anybody a living."

The Bombay High Court has permitted the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to 
kill dogs at the Mumbai airport in an "emergency" situation.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice C.K. Thakker and Justice S.A. Borde 
Thursday expressed "concern about passenger safety" and empowered AAI to kill 
dogs in the interest of air commuters. 

The court said: "The right of life was more important to humans and that if 
the dogs can cause a plane crash, they had to go."

The bench observed that under the Airports Authorities of India Act and the 
Aircraft Act, it was permissible for the director general of civil aviation to 
issue directions to deal with passenger safety, which could be compromised by 
stray dogs on the runway. 

The court said that "a high-ranking official would have to decide what 
constitutes an 'emergency' and would have to give reasons in writing why it was 
necessary to kill the dogs".

TWENTY-FIVE years of commercial hunting across the South Australian savannah 
and Peter Absalom can't recall a drought killing off kangaroos as it has in 
the past 12 months.

"Everybody is feeling the pain," Absalom says. 
"In a drought nothing survives ... the poor things." 
Absalom is a "field processor" who works around Mulyungarie Station, north of 
Broken Hill. 
He culls roos under the annual quota set down by National Parks and Wildlife 
after aerial surveys of the kangaroo population inside a "commercial zone". 
His kills help service a regulated $200 million industry, which is a 
by-product of a government-mandated kangaroo cull in South Australia, Western 
Australia, NSW and Queensland. For consumers, this is presented as a range of products 
including kangaroo fillets, steaks, a range of marinated steaks, kebabs, mini 
roasts, sausages, burgers and mince. 
Absalom's anecdotal account of the drought's impact is confirmed by Stuart 
Cairns, a University of New England zoologist and population ecologist, who has 
just returned from Mulyungarie and says the density in the area has fallen 
from more than 50 kangaroos per square kilometre to about 15 per square 
kilometre. 
"Its knocked them for a six, ," Dr Cairns says of the drought's impact on the 
kangaroo population. "In NSW, numbers are probably down by 50 per cent. I do 
my work in South Australia and numbers are down there by a third and I think 
they will go down again."

        <docText>Overgrowth of elephant population in 
South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP) has posed threats to the safety of 
bio-diversity and human beings in the area, an expert has warned. 
    The park is now struggling to cope with more than 11,500 elephants since 
there will be not enough vegetation to feed the jumbos, the park's former 
conservation head Willem Gertenbach said,suggesting the population should be 
controlled through regular culling. 
    "The park's bio-diversity will suffer irreparable damage if the numbers 
are not slashed soon," he was quoted as saying by Saturday's newspaper The 
Citizen. 
    At least four persons have been trampled to death by elephants and more 
than three were injured in South Africa in the past six months. The death of 
ecologist Kay Hiscocks on Tuesday near the KNP shocked the country. 
    "The jumbos might have been attacking people because of behavioral 
changes brought about by their frustration and stress at the overcrowding," said 
Gertenbach, who retired at the end of 2002. 
    He said environmental guidelines allowed no more than 8,000 elephants in 
the national park, and regular culling was carried out to control numbers 
before the country's environmental affairs ministry placed a moratorium on culling 
in 1994.

ZELLWOOD, Fla.News showed images of "dog body bags" with legs sticking out and 
other animal skeletons too graphic to show located behind Jancy Pet Burial 
Services in Orange County, Fla. 
"It makes you sick to your stomach," Greenbriar Pet Resort spokesman Barry 
Grimm said. "What of these thousands and thousands of animals that are buried in 
that pit? What is it doing to our ground water supply?" 
Jancy Pet Burial Services prides itself as being a dignified final resting 
place for pets, according to the report. However, it now faces allegations of 
improper pet disposal.

A fowl flap is simmering at an Oakland restaurant that has been skewered
by animal rights protesters for serving an expensive appetizer made from
fattened duck and goose livers.

Several weeks ago, members of Voices for Animal Liberation began
protesting outside Lucca on South Craig Street, which serves foie gras,
French for "fat liver."

The protesters' beef is that some producers of the $15-a-plate delicacy
force feed the ducks and geese to bulk up their livers. Joe Jordan,
Lucca's owner, said he has received letters and videos from the University
of Pittsburgh-based group and from People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals protesting the menu item.

Jordan arrived at work yesterday to find a stone obelisk in front of the
restaurant toppled over. A statue of the Venus de Milo also has been
"chopped to bits," Jordan said.

Judy Borsellino, owner of Triangle Towing Service on Ferry Street in
Newark, says it was "divine providence" when she looked up at about noon
yesterday and saw a brown and white steer from the slaughterhouse across
the street making a break for it.

And he was headed straight into her garage. 

"I saw him coming and I said: "I'm being sent a message," said Borsellino.
"He looked, made a right and came in. I said: 'Close the gate.'"

Not only is Borsellino a "semi- vegetarian" who doesn't eat beef, she
claims the company that owns the steer, Baraka Halal Fresh Meats on
Lockwood Street, owes her $4,000 from work she did on its trucks last year.

When employees of the slaughterhouse came after the steer, she told them
they could have the animal back when she got paid for her work. But after
some thought, Borsellino, who lives in Berkeley Heights, said she plans to
set the daring steer free -- someplace where he won't face a butcher's blade.

"You don't want to hear those animals crying. And the smell. It's a tough
neighbor to have," said Borsellino, holding a ledger she said showed the
slaughterhouse's balance. "This is Amnesty International."

Xiao Fang, a squeamish housewife in the eastern China province of Jiangsu, 
never thought her husband would divorce her for killing a pet dog he had kept 
for seven years.

"Who's more important to him after all -- his wife or a dog?" asked the 
bewildered mother of a 17-year-old boy.

Earlier this year, Xiao and her husband bought a new apartment in the 
provincial capital Nanjing. "The new flat is nicely furnished and I didn't want the 
dog to mess it up," Xinhua quoted her as saying.

Xiao said she had tried to send the dog away in the first place, but failed. 
"Heihu was so clever that it managed to come back no matter how far I had 
taken him. So I hired four men to kill it when my husband was travelling on 
business."

Heihu, which literally means "black tiger", was the wolfhound her husband and 
son loved dearly. 

She was soon sorry for what she had done because the hostility from her 
husband and son was unbearable. Her husband, Xu, in his 40s, was beside himself 
when he learned of Heihu's death. 

"He was like as a member of our family to me. How could she be so cruel?"
Xu asked his wife, saying he could no longer live under the same roof with a 
murderer and divorce was the only way out.

The tragedy also saddened their son Xiao Gang, a senior high school student 
who for the first time in his life defied his mother.

The importing of cat and dog fur products will be banned if Labor wins this 
year's federal election.
Opposition consumer affairs spokesman Alan Griffin said the ban was needed to 
"end the cruel and deceptive trade in dog and cat fur" and to protect 
consumers from buying falsely labeled products.
The policy, to be announced today, was welcomed by the Humane Society, which 
has campaigned for a ban and last year revealed people were unwittingly buying 
products made from cat and dog fur including clothing, ornaments and toys.
"Current laws do not prevent the importation, manufacture or sale of products 
made from dog and cat skin and fur, a practice which has rightly caused 
controversy and outrage," Mr. Griffin said.
"The ban is necessary to protect Australian consumers from fraud as the 
makers of these products attempt to deceive consumers by falsely labeling them as 
originating from fictitious animals."
Mr. Griffin said there was also evidence of health risks associated with dog 
and cat fur being used in toys, such as the carcinogen chromium, which is used 
in tanning at fur factories.

When it comes to her personal life though, Ms Deirdre Moss, the executive 
officer of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), is 
guarded.
She took two days to decide whether she should do this e-mail interview, 
worried it would force her to reveal details about her personal life.
In the end, the opportunity to speak on behalf of animals won her over.
Born in Brisbane, the 51-year-old Singapore permanent resident claims to be 
an accidental animal rights activist.
A former secretary, she became a volunteer at the SPCA in 1983, when she was 
31.
In a rare interview with The Straits Times four years ago, she said: 'The 
SPCA came along at a time when I needed something different in my life. I guess 
it was a late calling, at the age of 31.'
Twenty-one years later, she is still there, as executive officer.
'My whole life,' she claimed, 'is the SPCA.'
What keeps her going, she said, is the knowledge that she's doing something 
good.
'The work may be depressing at times, caring for others who are not as 
fortunate as yourself, but I think if you're a contented person, you should share 
your life with others who are not so fortunate.'
Q : Do you think Singapore should, like New York, have its own pet police?
A : That depends on what your definition of pet police is: Is it pets 
themselves doing the watchdogging? 
But if you mean should there be police specifically assigned to protect pets, 
then a qualified 'yes'. Cruelty to animals should be fought on several 
fronts: deterrence and punishment, as well as education. As a matter of fact, in 
Britain, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals policed 
animal cruelty before there was a police force for humans.

AMMAN - A group of children rush into a pet shop in one of Amman's 
up-market shopping districts and peer into a small, cramped cage holding a 
baboon. 
 
The youngsters squeal with delight as the clearly agitated animal leaps in 
frustration from one metal bar to the next. 
"It's not cruel keeping it like this," insists the shop owner. 
The two-year-old baboon, probably brought into Jordan from its natural 
habitat in the Arabian Peninsula, is on sale for 400 dinars ($560). 
Next to the baboon is an even smaller cage containing a litter of black and 
white puppies that are practically lying on top of each other. Further along, a 
Siamese cat claws at the cardboard flooring of its pen not much larger than a 
shoebox. 
The pet shop will continue to trade as Jordan has no animal protection laws 
and because the notion of animal welfare is low on the priority list for people 
in this part of the world. 
Jordanians are often mystified at how sentimental Westerners can be toward 
animals. Few people in the kingdom keep pets. Dogs, for example, are widely seen 
as dirty and unhygienic. 
But attitudes are slowly changing, according to the Society for the 
Protection of Animals (SPANA), a charity that works in Jordan as well as the rest of 
the Middle East and North Africa. 
"It's important to stress that animals suffer here through ignorance and not 
through malice," Dr Ghazi Mostafa, director of the charity's Jordanian branch, 
told Reuters. 
"We are gradually helping to educate people to take better care of animals 
and to respect them more." 
SPANA has worked in the kingdom for the past 10 years. It offers free 
veterinary care through its four clinics -- two of which are mobile and can reach 
remote villages.

Everyone talks about how much hunting and fishing mean to Colorado?s economy, 
and a recent study commissioned by the Colorado Division of Wildlife shows 
just how valuable outdoor recreation is to the state.
The report, titled ?Economic Impacts of Hunting, Fishing and Wildlife 
Watching in Colorado,? says hunting and fishing together contributed an estimated 
$1.5 billion to the state?s economy in 2002. 
This includes $800 million in direct spending along with $700 million in 
indirect or secondary spending.
Of that, fishing contributed $460 million in direct revenues, including $308 
million spent by residents and $151 million spent by out-of-state visitors.
Hunters spent $340 million, and combined, the two activities supported more 
than 22,000 jobs around the state.
?This report supports what the DOW has known for years,? said Linda 
Sikorowski of the division?s policy and regulations section, who helped oversee the 
data gathered for the research. ?Wildlife-related activities are important 
contributors to Colorado?s economy and remain among the most-popular pastimes 
statewide for residents and visitors.?
The report also said big-game hunters collectively spent more than 1.42 
million activity days (a day or any portion thereof spent hunting) afield in 2002 
while small-game hunters spent 672,000 days hunting.

SAN FRANCISCO -- 
The San Francisco Zoo has decided to permanently close its pachyderm exhibit 
amid criticism over the deaths of two of its four elephants.

When the two remaining elephants are sent to other facilities, it will be the 
first time since the San Francisco Zoo opened in 1929 that visitors will not 
be able to see the giant land mammals from Asia and Africa.

For years, the zoo has faced criticism from animal rights advocates in the 
San Francisco Bay area over its small and antiquated elephant enclosures.

But the criticism grew increasingly fierce after Maybelle, a 44-year-old 
African elephant, unexpectedly collapsed and died April 22.

Elephants generally live 50 to 60 years in the wild, experts say.

Maybelle died of heart failure, but zoo officials haven't determined the 
underlying cause of her cardiovascular collapse, zoo spokeswoman Nancy Chan said. 
According to zoo records, Maybelle had a long history of health problems, 
including chronic colic, anemia and various foot and joint ailments.

Less than seven weeks earlier, Calle, a 37-year-old Asian elephant, was put 
down by zoo officials because of her deteriorating health. She suffered 
degenerative joint disease, a history of tuberculosis and an old injury sustained in 
a highway crash in Mexico when she was a performer in a traveling circus.

The two surviving elephants - Tinkerbelle and Lulu, both 38 - also suffer a 
number of health problems, including colic and various foot, leg and hip 
ailments, zoo records show.

Since the deaths of Calle and Maybelle, the zoo has been the target of 
protests by animal rights advocates.

Boynton Beach? Protesters on Saturday held neon-colored signs, handed out 
literature and assailed the way "puppy mills" mistreat their animals.

About a dozen protesters who stood in front of Puppy Palace, 3557 Boynton 
Beach Blvd., were part of a statewide campaign to raise awareness about puppy 
mills.
Puppy mills, they said, are cramped, squalid commercial-breeding facilities, 
mostly in the Midwest, that provide puppies to retail pet stores. The 
activists claimed puppy mills produce unhealthy animals that often have genetic 
defects due to inbreeding. 

The Boynton Beach store was sued in 2003 for misrepresenting the quality of 
the puppies it sold.

Puppy Palace's owner denies that it buys from puppy mills. 

Carey Siriani of West Palm Beach owns a border collie, Mia, which came from 
Puppy Palace two years ago. On Saturday Mia was wearing a placard that read 
"Survivor." Mia was neurotic and had terrible allergies, Siriani said, and has 
required thousands of dollars worth of medical treatment.

"We're not a bunch of freaks. We're just trying to educate people," she said. 
"They're going to get big problems in their wallets and a huge heartbreak for 
their kids."

WASHINGTON -- Two years before she confirmed the first U.S. case of mad
cow disease, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman assured concerned consumers
that her agency had halted the infection at the nation's borders.

Evidence, she told news reporters Nov. 30, 2001, came from a study by the
Harvard Center for Risk Analysis showing the risk of mad cow, or BSE,
entering the country was "extremely low." Her assertions became the
foundation of major USDA decisions dealing with mad cow.

But the agency-sponsored study did not assess efforts to keep the disease
out of the United States as Veneman said, The Oregonian has found.
Researchers with the Harvard center, part of the university's School of
Public Health, had spent two years trying to measure the risk that mad cow
might enter the United States before concluding they could not.

SEVILLE, Spain  For the many around the world who pity Spain's fighting
bulls and the inevitability of their fate, it is worth knowing that bulls
do not always die as planned.

Last Friday, a lean, elegantly weathered 47-year-old bull breeder named
Geronimo Astolfi supervised the loading of eight of his best bulls onto a
truck at his family's ranch in the village of Villaverde del Rio.

The bulls then made the 30-minute trip through the flat countryside and
the traffic circles to Seville and its 18th-century bullring, La
Maestranza, where they were to be inspected before being sent to a
bullfight the following day.

This was a major moment in Astolfi's career. The corridas, or bullfights,
during Seville's April Fair are second in prestige only to those in
Madrid, and though his bulls were used in Madrid last season, it had been
almost eight years since his bulls had been invited to take part in his
home city.

"The last time it did not go well," he said. "They make you pay for it
when it does not go well."

Please don't assume that someone else has answered this email or helped out.  
There are times that things get posted on here and not one response comes 
back.   The more ideas, the more people advise, the better!! THANKS!!!

I've gotten a call from a woman that lives in Shawnee and is in a difficult 
situation with a neglected nursing mother dog.  I'm hoping some of you that 
live in the Shawnee area may be able to help her, especially if you are familar 
with the animal control/shelter system there.  Also, I know some folks on  
this list (not in Shawnee) have a lot of experience with domestic animal issues 
in the area related to animal control and/or abuse.  If you can offer  help or 
advice in any way, please contact Amy Wilson at (405) 255-4749.

The problem:  Amy found a very emaciated dog in her neighborhood, took the  
dog to a vet who said the dog was malnourished and dehydrated and probably 
hadn't eaten for days.  A neighbor came to Amy and said that the dog was his, and 
that she was nursing a litter of puppies.  Amy asked the man to  prove the dog 
was his, and he showed her the puppies--who immediately took to nursing from 
the mother.  Amy offered to give the man money for dog food, feed them 
herself, or buy the dog and puppies from him, all of which he refused.  She checks 
daily on the dog, which never has any food or water,  and the mother dog shares 
a yard with a large boxer who apparently eats any 
food she puts over the fence.

Amy contacted animal control for help.  They were rude and unhelpful in 
several ways, and she wants to advance on animal negligence/cruelty charges  
but the animal control offices will not do anything.

Obviously a nursing dog is in immediate need of good nutrition and plenty of  
water, so that need is dire.  In addition, some form of legal action needs  
to be taken to remedy the complete lack of support for animals in this area.

[Animalconcerns - more JOBs added!!]

A quart of whiskey, a pack of cigarettes and a cube of LSD is better for
you than eating one piece of meat, a doctor once told Peter Burwash,
former Hawai'i resident and Davis Cup champion turned tennis coach, author
and motivational speaker.

"The trauma of the extra (meat-derived) chemicals in the body is
horrendous," Burwash said, clarifying the analogy. "An athlete should have
no meat, fish, poultry or eggs."

A professional tennis player for seven years, motivational speaker for 30
years and vegetarian for 34 years, Burwash spoke about nutrition and
exercise to nearly 150 attendees last Wednesday in the Kuykendall Auditorium.

Burwash spends 150 days a year touring the world as a motivational speaker
and has written 10 books on topics ranging from nutrition to leadership to
teen suicide. The lecture was sponsored by the Vegetarian Society of Hawai'i. 
...
Burwash said Atkins was the "epitome of poor health."

The Atkins diet also requires a significant protein intake. But too much
protein can be detrimental, Burwash said, because it makes the blood
acidic, drains bones of calcium and causes tendons and ligaments to tear
easily.

Compassionate Action for Animals gave out food on the West Bank plaza in
hopes of taking on some new supporters Monday.

Members of the student group, which has about 70 active members, gave
pamphlets and food to help spread the word about veganism, outreach
coordinator Greg Oschwald, who graduated from the University?s Morris
campus, said.

For some, outreach efforts such as these events turn people away from all
meat and animal products and onto a vegan diet, he said.

Vegan Outreach, an international animal rights activist group, has done
research that shows how students often become vegans after trying vegan
food at outreach events, Oschwald said.

The student group used pamphlets from Vegan Outreach during its event Monday.

Matt Ball, executive director and co-founder of Vegan Outreach, said the
organization focuses on reaching college students.

VANCOUVER, B.C. -- It's your wedding anniversary, so you go out for seafood. 
As you and your mate reflect on your years together, you're both salivating 
in anticipation of a fine meal of ...

Jellyfish?

That's the picture of the not-too-distant future painted yesterday for 1,500 
fisheries scientists from around the globe by one of the world's leading 
fisheries researchers, Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia.

Kicking off the World Fisheries Congress, the veteran scientist showed how 
people's growing appetite for seafood has driven fishing boats from 
industrialized countries ever farther into Southern Hemisphere seas 
controlled by Third World nations.

It's a pattern also reflected in Puget Sound, where commercial fishing has 
virtually disappeared but a Seattle-based fleet goes all the way to Alaska 
to land the nation's biggest fish catch.

Pauly recounted how, as traditional fish stocks have declined, people in 
Third World countries increasingly have turned to eating lower on the food 
chain, even taking in the likes of sea cucumbers and sea urchins -- "stuff 
that eats dirt," Pauly said.

"When we first presented this, it was a joke -- you're going to have a 
jellyfish sandwich," Pauly said in his keynote address. "The journalists all 
ate it up -- not the jellyfish, the quote. It was a joke, but now it's 
real."

In the wake of the disastrous crash of the North Atlantic's cod stocks, the 
Newfoundland government is encouraging fishermen to go after jellyfish, 
Pauly said.

It's probably also tested on animals.


WARNING ABOUT SWIFFER WET JETS AND PETS


Hi all,
This warning about a popular cleaning product was just forwarded to
me. My source is very reliable so I felt it necessary to post it here.


  Warning for your animal's health:
  
  
  
   I recently had a neighbor who had to have their 5-year old German
  Shepherd dog put down due to liver failure. The dog was completely
  healthy until a few weeks ago, so they had a necropsy done to see
  what the cause was. The liver levels were unbelievable, as if the
  dog had ingested poison of some kind. The dog is kept inside, and
  when he's outside, someone's with him, so the idea of him getting
  into something unknown was hard to believe. My neighbor started
going
  through all the items in the house. When he got to the Swiffer
  Wetjet, he noticed, in very tiny print, a warning which stated "may
  be harmful to small children and animals." He called the company to
  ask what the contents of the cleaning agent are and was astounded
to
  find out that anitfreeze is one of the ingredients. (actually he
was
  told it's a compound which is one molecule away from anitfreeze).
  Therefore, just by the dog walking on the floor cleaned with the
  solution, then licking it's own paws, and the dog eating from its
  dishes which were kept on the kitchen floor cleaned with this
  product, it ingested enough of the solution to destroy its liver.
  Soon after his dog's death, his housekeepers' two cats also died of
  liver failure. They both used the Swiffer Wetjet for quick cleanups
  on their floors. Necropsies weren't done on the cats, so they
  couldn't file a lawsuit, but he asked that we spread the word to as
  many people as possible so they don't lose their animals.
  
  
  PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!

        <docText>Art Sosa is taking us on a tour of his farm in Donna.
It?s home to more than 80 heads of cattle and that?s why he moved some of his 
son?s animals over to the Donna  High School Ag farm, where he attends class.
?I did have consent from the Ag school teachers to put them there,? Art 
explains.
He showed us what he calls a written agreement between the teachers and 
himself with signatures included.
But, it?s apparently not enough.
Art recently received district letters shortly after Action 4 News exposed 
potential animal cruelty with a dead, student pig at the ag farm.
They ordered Art to remove his animals from the farm.
?I  would, but I don?t know if the animals have a disease and I don?t want to 
infect the other animals on the farm,? Art says in defense.
A 250 pound swine was found in a bloody pen, allegedly some three days after 
it died last week. 
The school district says it suspended both ag teachers and met behind closed 
doors at an emergency school board meeting to discuss an investigation into 
the death?but that?s not all.
They also met to kick art off the farm.

Summer months spark a boom in the pet population. And 
a 6 News investigation found that a record number of animals in East Tennessee 
are literally dying for adoption. 
During the warm months, most animals in East Tennessee shelters will only see 
one pair of caring hands. The ones that may also have to take their lives. 
It's breeding season and before summer is over, hundreds of unwanted cats and 
dogs will pass through shelters. 
During a visit to the Oak Ridge animal center, the 6 News crew saw strays, 
surrenders, full growns and newborns. But workers said the majority will never 
find a home. 
See list of area animal adoption shelters 

Experts say the reason is simple, irresponsible people. "This isn't a car you 
just can't put it on the sidewalk and leave it sitting there," said Oak Ridge 
animal control Officer Brian Porter. "These things breed. They eat, hurt, 
die, the whole spectrum. But yet, they're considered a piece of property."

TO THE anti-globalisers, the corporation is a devilish instrument of 
environmental destruction, class oppression and imperial conquest. But is it 
also pathologically insane? That is the provocative conclusion of an 
award-winning documentary film, called &#x201c;The Corporation&#x201d;, coming soon to a 
cinema near you. People on both sides of the globalisation debate should pay 
attention. Unlike much of the soggy thinking peddled by too many 
anti-globalisers, &#x201c;The Corporation&#x201d; is a surprisingly rational and coherent 
attack on capitalism's most important institution.

It begins with a potted history of the company's legal form in America, 
noting the key 19th-century legal innovation that led to treating companies 
as persons under law. By bestowing on them the rights and protections that 
people enjoy, this legal innovation gave the company the freedom to 
flourish. So if the corporation is a person, ask the film's three Canadian 
co-creators, Mark Achbar, Joel Bakan and Jennifer Abbott, what sort of 
person is it?

The answer, elicited over two-and-a-half hours of interviews with left-wing 
intellectuals, right-wing captains of industry, economists, psychologists 
and philosophers, is that the corporation is a psychopath. Like all 
psychopaths, the firm is singularly self-interested: its purpose is to 
create wealth for its shareholders. And, like all psychopaths, the firm is 
irresponsible, because it puts others at risk to satisfy its 
profit-maximising goal, harming employees and customers, and damaging the 
environment. The corporation manipulates everything. It is grandiose, always 
insisting that it is the best, or number one. It has no empathy, refuses to 
accept responsibility for its actions and feels no remorse. It relates to 
others only superficially, via make-believe versions of itself manufactured 
by public-relations consultants and marketing men. In short, if the metaphor 
of the firm as person is a valid one, then the corporation is clinically 
insane.

There is a tendency among anti-globalisers to demonise captains of industry. 
But according to &#x201c;The Corporation&#x201d;, the problem with companies does not lie 
with the people who run them. Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, a former boss of Shell, 
comes across in the film as a sympathetic and human character. At one point, 
he and his wife greet protesters camped on the front lawn of their English 
cottage with offers of a cup of tea and apologies for the lack of soya milk 
for the vegans among them.

        <docText>Deforestation is endangering about one-third of 
the world's 1,200 bamboo species and threatening rare animals such as giant 
pandas and mountain gorillas that depend on the plants for food and protection.
A joint report released Tuesday by the United Nations Environment Program and 
the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan warned it would also harm a 
$2 billion a year bamboo industry and the millions of people who use the plants 
for food, housing, furniture and handicrafts.
"There are about 1,200 species of bamboo in the world and we think about a 
third of those may be threatened by the reduction of forest habitat within their 
ranges," Valerie Kapos, co-author of the study and ecologist at the U.N. 
Environment Program World Monitoring Center in Cambridge, England, told Reuters.
The report entitled "Bamboo Diversity" is the most comprehensive analysis to 
date of the impact of deforestation on bamboo species.

        <docText>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has
ordered its inspectors in Texas not to talk about mad cow disease with
outside parties.

United Press International has learned that the gag order was sent May 6
by e-mail from the USDA's Dallas district office. It was issued in the
wake of the April 27 case at Lone Star Beef in San Angelo, in which a cow
displaying signs of a brain disorder was not tested for mad cow disease
despite a federal policy to screen all such animals for the deadly
disease, otherwise known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

        <docText>This is the tenth in a series of stories on the Pelican Man's 
Bird Sanctuary in Sarasota. 
An arrest warrant has been issued for Mel Beall, former Pelican Man's Bird 
Sanctuary clinic manager. 
The warrant charges Beall, 45, with obtaining a controlled substance by 
fraud. His present whereabouts are unknown, authorities said. 
Beall has been at the center of a firestorm of allegations made by former 
employees that he mismanaged the clinic and abused animals. 
In April, Beall was hospitalized under the Baker Act after he was found lying 
near outside the clinic with a bottle of an unknown substance nearby. The 
Baker Act allows authorities to hold a person for up to 72 hours if they think 
the individual will harm himself or others. 
Beall was also charged recently by the Florida Department of Business and 
Professional Regulation with practicing veterinary medicine without a license.

WO days of heroic efforts by whale rescuers seemed destined for a tragic end 
last night. 
The 40-foot whale pulled out to sea after becoming stranded near the La Brea 
coastline on Sunday, beached itself again yesterday. 
An all-day fight by more than 100 people ended with the exhausted animal 
being dragged two miles out to sea. 
By that time, rescuers said it was in bad shape. 
Senior Game Warden Samsundar Ramdeen said: 
"It was rolling in the current and waves and not as sprightly as yesterday 
(Monday). 
"Things look grim, but I am still crossing my fingers. I still have faith." 
Petrotrin's environmental specialist Francois Khan was less optimistic". 
"After about ten minutes (of pulling) we realised we were not getting signs 
of life from it. We realised we got no signs of life. 
Since the whale, described as a "Bryde's Whale" was found stranded, animals 
lovers have fought off people planning to butcher the animal and chasing off 
those who used knives on the whale to inscribe their names or to cut off chunks 
of blubber.

PLEASANTON -- After nearly two years of lobbying, an Oakland-based animal
welfare group will again argue for a ban on wild animal acts at the
Alameda County Fair.

A meeting -- hosted by the Fair Liaison Committee of the Alameda County
Board of Supervisors -- will be held Tuesday in a small conference room in
Oakland with room for only about 30 people.

Eric Mills of Action for Animals said his group purchased two half-page
newspaper ads to publicize the meeting.

The ads, which were published in today's Tri-Valley Herald and the Oakland
Tribune, cost$1,200, Mills said.

What exactly is it that vegetarians eat?

That's a question asked by researchers in the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition, who then reported on those who eat no meat, poultry or fish.

Or, at least profess that they do.

It turns out that a number of people who report being vegetarians actually
consume meat, poultry and fish regularly. They just eat these foods less
often than the rest of the nation's omnivores.

In a study of daily food records from more than 13,000 Americans, Loma
Linda University researchers discovered that fewer than 1 percent of those
surveyed (including self-described vegetarians) ate no animal flesh.
...
It's commonly understood that vegetarians don't eat meat, poultry or fish.
Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat some dairy products and eggs. Vegans, on the
other hand, eschew all animal products, whether from land or sea,
including dairy products, plus clothing made from wool, silk and leather.
"There aren't many of those in the United States," says Hasso-Haddad.

The study found that people who consider themselves vegetarian -- no
matter how strictly they actually avoid animal products -- appear to eat
more healthfully than their omnivorous counterparts. For example,
self-described vegetarians followed diets lower in total fat, saturated
fat and cholesterol. They also consumed more fiber and fruit than the
meat-eaters. Strict vegetarians -- that group of less than 1 percent --
consumed more grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit and wine than other
self-described vegetarians.

The RSPCA has rejected offers by six soldiers to do voluntary work with
animals after they pleaded guilty to cruelly treating and killing kittens
at a military barracks in Townsville.

The animal protection body also said on Tuesday the $2000 fines handed out
to the soldiers were manifestly inadequate when a maximum penalty of
$75,000 was available to magistrates for animal cruelty offences.

The privates from Townsville's Lavarack Barracks appeared in the
Townsville Magistrates Court on Monday on one count each of cruelty to
animals.

The charges stemmed from an April 10 drinking session in which one kitten
was dragged behind a motorcycle then crushed under the wheel of a vehicle
and three others were doused with fuel and set alight.

Norwegian whalers set sail for the Barents Sea on Monday as they kicked
off this year's hunt for minke whales, defying an international moratorium
and angry protests from environmentalists.
...
The Global Anti-Whaling Campaign, an umbrella organisation of some 140
international associations, has meanwhile criticised the Norwegian method
of killing whales.

The whalers use harpoons tipped with grenades, meant to deliver a fatal
nervous shock as they detonate inside a whale's body. Animal rights
activists have described the method as "real torture".

City and country tussled Tuesday during a Senate committee hearing on
legislation to ban hog-dog competitions.

Hog-dog supporters told the Senate Committee on Judiciary C that city
folks have no place trying to ban a venerable slice of rural culture that
they say does not harm hogs or the dogs trying to capture them.

Country folks need to give up the "brutal" and "sadistic" competition and
spend the time they save learning to read and write, said Sen. Ken Hollis,
R-Metairie.

Waving literature provided by supporters that contained "page after page"
of misspelled words, Hollis said hog-dog supporters would be better served
if they sat "around and read to each other."

The RSPCA today called for six soldiers who tortured and killed four
kittens at a barracks in Townsville to be dismissed from the Army.

RSPCA national president Hugh Wirth said the animal protection body had
been inundated with calls from members and the public expressing outrage
at the callous treatment of the kittens.

The Melbourne veterinarian wrote to Defence Minister Robert Hill today,
calling on him to make strong representations to army command to have the
six soldiers discharged because they were unfit to serve.

Dr Wirth said studies had shown that young people who tortured and killed
animals were prone to later acts of violence against other people
including wife bashing and other crimes.

"For that reason we believe there's no place for these people in the
army," Dr Wirth said.

The circus is coming to town. Please consider this before taking your
family to the circus:

Training methods are often abusive, cruel and stressful. Circus trainers
use whips, tight collars, electric prods, bullhooks, and other tools to
break animals? spirits and teach submission. In fact, The ASPCA, the Fund
for Animals and the Animal Welfare Institute brought a lawsuit against
Ringling Bros. under the Endangered Species Act for its mistreatment of
elephants. Earlier this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected
Ringling's arguments that the case should be thrown out, and the case will
go forward in federal district court in Washington, D.C.

UPPERVILLE, Va. --  At the Hunter's Head Tavern, "guilt-free dining" has
nothing to do with calories or carb counts.

The English pub in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, about 50
miles west of Washington, D.C., this week became the first restaurant in
the nation to receive an animal-welfare group's certification for a menu
with humanely raised and slaughtered fare, from the beef stew to the
shepherd's pie. 
...
"You can raise humane veal. There's no reason you have to keep them in a
crate, ... keep them anemic. God didn't create veal crates. We did,"
Lerner said. "If we can make people feel good about veal again, that's a
good thing."

A vegetarian for much of her life, Lerner said she understands the
contention by some that killing an animal for food is inhumane, no matter
how well you treat the animal in life or how painless the method of
slaughter is.

"People are going to eat meat," she said. "But if I get you to eat one of
my humanely raised turkeys, then that's one that Butterball doesn't kill."

Humane Farm Animal Care, which runs the certification program, is aligned
with two of the nation's leading animal-welfare organizations--the Humane
Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.

HFAC is not affiliated with the animal-rights group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, but PETA has been urging Kentucky Fried Chicken to
adopt HFAC's standards for the chicken served in its restaurants.

Legislation to control violent animal rights extremists is to be
toughened, the government said yesterday as the National Association of
Pension Funds said it might offer a reward for information that puts
ringleaders behind bars.

Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, rejected biotechnology industry
calls for a single piece of new legislation to combat animal extremism but
said additions to existing public order laws would be announced soon.

"There is going to be new legislation - but the extent is still to be
decided," he told the Lords. "Government is not convinced by a single
piece of legislation because it probably is going to be too slow to
implement. He said the government planned to identify key problems
legislate by attaching them to another bill. "Animal research must go
ahead," he said.

While the food at the residential dining halls at Cal State Long Beach may 
exceed the quality of many local restaurants and fast-food chains -- most diners 
don?t consider the origin of the food on their plate.
Chicken is the most popular food on the menu, said Patti Gray, director of 
residential dining at CSULB. With an Atkins diet craze in full swing, chicken 
and beef are now more popular than ever with massive factory farming companies 
that continued to succeed, regardless of a Mad-cow disease scare.
Tyson Foods Inc., the world?s largest poultry producer and packager, supplies 
the chicken for CSULB, as well as many K-12 institutions around the country. 
According to the Sierra Club, Tyson Foods has received $102.7 million for its 
sales to the School Lunch Program and other Federal Food Assistance Programs 
since 1996. 
Tyson operates packing facilities in 15 states, making it the largest factory 
farm in the United States. The company is also a main supplier for Kentucky 
Fried Chicken. 
The company was ranked 177th in the Fortune 500, yet was named in the 
Multinational Monitor?s ?Top Ten Worst Corporations? of 1999 after seven employees 
died in seven months at Tyson?s facilities and a slew of lawsuits regarding 
environmental and labor disputes embattled the company.
According to the Sierra Club?s Web site, Maryland environmental investigators 
confirmed pits of dead chicken carcasses and huge piles of exposed manure at 
two Tyson chicken factories, after a Washington Post reporter had observed the 
alleged violations and contacted state officials. Tyson Farms? actions 
violated the terms of a recent $6 million settlement of a federal pollution lawsuit 
by continuing to dump chicken carcasses and manure in shallow open-air pits, 
rather than in disposal sheds. For these violations, Tyson was fined $70,000.
In 2001, the U.S. Justice Department filed a 36-count indictment against 
Tyson Foods and six of its employees, executives and managers. The charges 
regarded a conspiracy to smuggle illegal aliens from Mexico and Central America to 
work in 15 of its U.S. poultry processing plants. 
The Justice Department alleged that Tyson and their coconspirators assisted 
the workers in obtaining fraudulent identification and employment documents. 
Three employees pleaded guilty and were fired. In March 2003, a federal grand 
jury acquitted Tyson Foods and three of its managers of the charges.

 Johannesburg man has been fined R4,000 by the Randburg Magistrate's Court 
for failing to adequately care for his exotic birds. The court, however, ruled 
that Mike Henn should remain the legal owner of the birds despite the sentence, 
police have confirmed. 
The case stems from the seizure of 51 exotic birds from Henn's ammunition 
warehouse in Strydom Park by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals (NSPCA) in October 2002. 
Evidence before the court was that the birds had been living in cages with 
decaying rat corpses and were poorly fed. The cages were also full of bird 
excrement and were unhygienic. 
Henn appeared briefly in court on Saturday and was found to have violated the 
Animals Protection Act of 1962. He was sentenced to a R4,000 fine (or 12 
months imprisonment). 
The court refused the NSPCA's application for ownership of the birds. 
The birds had been in the custody of the NSPCA since their seizure and the 
organisation intended placing them in a sanctuary where they would not be bred 
or traded. 
The court said it felt Henn had learned his lesson.

Lower Mifflin Township farmers Robert "Red" Allen and Dianne Allen, his 
daughter-in-law, were found guilty Tuesday on all charges of animal cruelty and 
neglect filed against them. 
After an all-day trial, District Justice Harold Bender found Red Allen guilty 
on 15 counts of animal cruelty and neglect and fined him $150 for each count.

In addition, Bender awarded the 14 animals that were confiscated by humane 
officers from Allen's farm Feb. 1 to the Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals and ordered him to pay $7,600 for the veterinary care of the animals 
after they were seized.

After the verdict, Austin Grogan, attorney for Red Allen, said he will appeal 
Bender's decision. "We're let down with the judge's decision - it's his 
opinion. We'll proceed with the appeal."

Fine increased

Bender initially found Dianne Allen guilty of two counts of animal neglect 
filed against her and fined her $50. She was accused of starving to death a duck 
and a chicken that were found dead in outdoor cages Feb. 1.

But Karl Rominger, Dianne Allen's attorney, said he had not rested his case 
and had not been allowed to present testimony. After Dianne Allen testified, 
Bender upheld his guilty verdict and upped her fine to $150 on each charge.


"I'm not buying your story," Bender told her.

Dianne Allen testified that the duck wasn't alive when it was put in the cage 
by her 8-year-old son. Later, she said she fed and watered the duck and 
chicken at 9:30 a.m. on the day humane officers seized animals at the farm.

Rominger presented as evidence a photo taken by Dianne Allen that showed food 
and water in the poultry cages after the visit by humane officers. But a 
photo taken by humane officers at the time they found the dead birds showed no 
food or water in their cages.

        <docText>The U.S. Agriculture Department's blunder in
failing to test a condemned Texas cow for mad cow disease may reflect
wider problems in the government's surveillance program, a Democratic
lawmaker said on Thursday.

The USDA last week acknowledged it erred in failing to test a 12-year-old
cow for the brain-wasting disease when the animal arrived at a Texas
slaughterhouse exhibiting a possible central nervous system disorder.

A USDA supervisor in Austin, Texas refused to test the animal despite
requests from federal animal health inspectors, said California Rep. Henry
Waxman.

"This sequence of events is troubling, and it raises the question of
whether this is an isolated incident," Waxman said in a letter to
Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman.

Mother's Day greetings were delivered early this year to three local moms
? with love from the federal government. In lieu of cards, FBI agents
hand-delivered subpoenas ? demanding that the women comply with the most
coercive of judicial investigations: the grand jury.

Jennifer Woodruff and Twiga May-Whittier have been subpoenaed as part of
an ongoing investigation into the Romania auto arson that brought Carla
Martinez and other activists before the grand jury more than two years ago
(see EW archives 1/17/02). Heather Whitney, the mother of a newborn, has
been subpoenaed to testify as a witness in Seattle as part of an
investigation the Washington US Attorney vaguely referred to as crimes
committed in the name of animal rights and/or environmentalism. 
...
But, according to government attorney Engdall, whether a person is a
mother is "irrelevent. The grand jury doesn't target people based on their
economic or social status. It invites people to come and present
documentation or testimony concerning a criminal investigation," he says.
...
"I can only wonder why they would call single mothers to testify,"
questions Woodruff. "I feel as though it is because we have so much more
at stake and that is one of the dirtiest, most unethical things that a
government can do to its own people."

Complex. 
Rodeo officials say they've called off the event over concerns it wouldn't 
meet state requirements that bullfights be part of a religious festival. 
Officials hoped to make the bullfight legal by linking it to the summer-long 
Portuguese Festa of the Holy Ghost. 
The plan was to partner with a local Portuguese group, AFDES, which would 
have a priest provide a 15-minute blessing before the bullfight, said Doc 
Etienne, an attorney for the Rodeo. 
But under the law, bullfighting must be part of an event that is primarily 
religious, and a 15-minute blessing doesn't seem like enough, Etienne said. 
"We couldn't substantively comply," he said. 
The event was supposed to be June 13. In the bloodless version of the sport, 
matadors with Velcro-tipped swords attach the spear to another piece of Velcro 
wrapped around the bull's back, instead of stabbing the bull in the back. 
A co-sponsoring organization is necessary because under state law passed in 
the mid-1970s, bullfights must be held in conjunction with a religious 
festival, and proceeds must benefit the organization celebrating the festival.

Three teenagers are accused of putting a pet goose and a blind duck in a
portable toilet and setting it on fire, killing the animals.

Authorities also have linked the three to eight other fires during the
last two months in Fort Myers Shores, including one at a business that
caused $200,000 in damage, according to the State Fire Marshal?s office.

Two 15-year-olds and one 13-year-old face charges of arson, cruelty to
animals, grand theft and criminal mischief, the fire marshal?s office
said. The Lee County Sheriff?s Office could not confirm the arrest of the
13-year-old. The News-Press is not naming them because of their ages.

A contentious chapter in the history of Collier County Domestic Animal 
Services ended this week with a final report by an independent investigator 
concerning allegations of mismanagement. 
Mike Carr, who investigated the agency for a local private animal shelter 
Friends of Gummi, said his findings won't go to a grand jury to test if criminal 
prosecution is in order. But he recommended a new approach to dealing with 
animal cruelty cases that will have department staff doing a better job 
collecting evidence to prosecute such cases. 
"(State Attorney) Steve Russell was thrilled that that was in the report," 
Carr said. "The training (animal control officers) was they were being told to 
issue civil citations when they caught people doing things that are crimes." 
Carr offered glowing compliments for how county officials handled the 
emotionally charged situation around DAS that had employees and former employees as 
well as outsiders alleging mismanagement. 
He said in his interim and final reports that, among other problems, the 
department failed to auction all livestock and also allowed some to go to staff at 
discount prices, including valuable exotic birds that went to an animal 
control officer who raises and sells them and some livestock that were used for 
food.

NEWARK, N.J. --  A slaughterhouse escapee has grass under his hooves
again, after spending a week in an auto garage.

The young steer, named "Liberty" by his rescuer, is to spend the remainder
of his days at a shelter operated by Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y.

He was taken from Triangle Towing Service late Thursday night and arrived
at the shelter around 5 a.m. Friday, where he got a warm welcome from the
cows, said Lorri Bauston, executive director of Farm Sanctuary.

"They were giving him kisses and rubbing up against him," Bauston said.

The transport was arranged quickly, after the slaughterhouse owner
attempted to have the animal returned on Thursday, she said.

A day of negotiations ensued, ending in an agreement by which Triangle
owner Judy Borsellino would deduct the price of the calf from money she
was owed by the butcher for repair work.
...
 Bauston described Liberty as a Hereford breed, 8 to 9 months old.

"His only job will be to teach people that cows have feelings, too," she
said. "It's our hope that once people get to know farm animals as living,
feeling creatures, they won't eat them."

In addition to promoting vegetarianism, her nonprofit group encourages the
humane treatment of farm animals, she said.

WASHINGTON - Public comment on the U.S. Agriculture Department's ban on
allowing "downer" cattle into the food supply is running 10 to 1 in favor
of the restriction despite protests by several states and cattle groups.

The Associated Press reviewed roughly 440 written comments currently on
file with the USDA and found that about 400 were in favor of maintaining
the ban, while the rest favored relaxing it. Some responses received by
the USDA are not yet on file, and others that were received by e-mail are
also not on file.

Supporters of the ban cite health concerns and compassion as reasons to
keep it in place. Opponents say the ban should apply to diseased animals
but not to injured ones, which they say pose no health risk to humans.
...
Cattle groups said the ban was too broad and leads to pointlessly
condemning cattle that would otherwise bring money to farmers.

"If these (injured) animals are condemned, rather than slaughtered, then
producers will suffer an unnecessary economic loss," the National Milk
Producers Federation wrote. "Condemning animals suffering from a physical
injury such as a broken leg does not seem to be supported by science with
respect to BSE risk."

VANCOUVER, British Columbia - A Canadian immigration panel is considering
whether accused environmental saboteur Tre Arrow can apply for refugee
status in Canada.

Arrow, 30, who is wanted for fire bombing logging and cement trucks in
Oregon, asked the Canadian authorities to remain in Canada as a political
refugee at a hearing in Vancouver on Tuesday.

A key issue will be whether Arrow is affiliated with a terrorist group,
which would immediately disqualify him from receiving refugee status in
Canada, authorities said.

The Immigration and Refugee Board is scheduled to decide by May 31 whether
Arrow is affiliated with the Earth Liberation Front, a group the FBI
considers a terrorist organization responsible for scores of attacks on
property over the past dozen years.

AGAINST a global backdrop of outrage against the abuse of Iraqi prisoners
by American soldiers, another military scandal angered Australians this
week - the victims, four kittens.

The litter of a stray cats was held captive in a residential section of
Lavarack Barracks in Townsville during an Easter Saturday drinking session
involving six members of an army support battalion.

One kitten was dragged behind a motorcycle on a rope and then crushed
under the tyre of a 4WD vehicle, while the others were doused with fuel
and set alight.

Talkback radio lines ran hot and letters to the editor baskets filled up
with angry demands for the six Townsville-based servicemen to be
discharged from the Australian Army.

TOWN OF ROCHESTER - An emaciated dog who was found on Stony Kill Road has 
been returned to her owner, though charges are still pending in town court. 
   
The 14-year-old female boxer mix was found on Stony Kill Road on April 29 and 
turned over to the dog control officer who in turn brought the canine to the 
Kingston Animal Hospital. Her owner, James A. Baracca, 54, of 8 Stony Kill 
Drive, Accord, was charged April 30 by Ulster County sheriff's deputies with 
misdemeanor failing to provide proper sustenance to an animal. 
Veterinarian Arnold Rugg said Friday that the owner of the dog came to pick 
her up Monday night after calling from the town of Rochester courthouse. He 
said the owners were told the canine needs to be on a high-protein diet and 
antibiotics. Rugg added that the owners seemed to have missed the dog when they 
came to pick her up. He said they hugged her and cried over her.

TRENTON
A state senator from Burlington County jumped into the debate over mad cow
disease this week, introducing legislation that would have New Jersey
impose tougher rules on commercial animal feed than the federal government
does.

Under the terms of a bill introduced by Diane Allen, R-Edgewater Park,
"downer cows" could not be used in any commercial animal feed, not just
that fed to other cattle.

"Downer cows" are those too sick to walk.

Allen's initiative was prompted by allegations of a cluster of a rare
brain disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD, raised by a constituent,
Janet Skarbek of Cinnaminson.

Skarbek believes that an unusually high number of cases of CJD are
connected to eating tainted beef at the Garden State Racetrack.

A growing number of British pets are catching deadly diseases on foreign 
holidays as more animals travel with their owners on the "pets' passports" scheme 
introduced four years ago.
The School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool said that reported cases of some 
animal diseases picked up on holiday had doubled since 2002.
Last year 37 pet dogs - almost half of the 84 tested at the school - were 
found to have leishmaniasis, an incurable disease passed on by sandflies in 
Mediterranean countries.
The figure is more than double the 17 dogs that caught the disease on 
holidays in 2002. Symptoms include weight loss, eye disease and kidney failure.
Other diseases that have shown increases of about 100 per cent include 
babesiosis and ehrlichiosis - blood diseases spread by ticks - and heartworm, a 
parasite passed on by mosquitoes.
Brian and Jean Coleman, from Tyneside, were shocked and heartbroken when 
Hamie, their much-loved West Highland White terrier, died after contracting 
babesiosis when they were on holiday recently in south-west France.
"He was only 16 months old and had brought so much joy into our lives," said 
Mr Coleman, 55, a retired teacher.
Hamie was "perfectly fit and healthy" last month when the Colemans left to 
spend the Easter holidays at their cottage in the Dordogne.
The dog became seriously ill, however, shortly after the family returned home 
to South Shields and, after developing distressing symptoms, was taken to a 
vet and put on a respirator.
"We knew Hamie couldn't go on like that and that we had to tell the vet to 
stop the respirator," Mr Coleman said. 
"It was awful. I never thought we would lose our little friend in such a 
terrible way. We were shattered by his death."

The setting: an operating room in Guelph, Ontario, where a team of doctors 
are hard at work trying to remove a faulty pacemaker wire from four-year-old 
Nikki?s heart. She?s had heart problems all her life and unless the wire is 
removed, she will die.
?It would be easier for us if we had the wire going this way,? says one 
doctor.
?Just put a finger underneath the heart so I can lift it up and just hold it 
so I can see where this should go,? says another.
?Is that good??
?Yeah, that?s fine.?
?Tell me when I can let it go.?
?OK, let?s put him back down. We?ll do this in stages.?
The conversation sounds like an exchange between doctors in any OR in Canada, 
but the Guelph facility where they are operating isn?t your ordinary hospital 
and Nikki isn?t your ordinary patient. In fact, this hospital is part of the 
Ontario Veterinary College, and Nikki, a boxer, is one of about 9,600 dogs 
that are treated there each year.
And it?s not just dogs that get treated at Guelph. The facility is a 
full-service teaching and referral hospital and features two clinics ? one for large 
animals such as horses and another for smaller animals where everything from 
dogs and cats to ferrets are welcome.
?I like to think of this as the ? Sick Kids Hospital of veterinary medicine,?
 says Dr. Karol Mathews, who runs the Intensive Care Unit at the small animal 
clinic. ?You could also maybe compare it to a Toronto hospital. It?s a 
teaching hospital. We have all types of specialists here. These are cases that we 
would see that would be referred by your family physician or your family 
veterinarian, simply because of the complexity of the illness or the injury, and 
just as you wouldn?t expect your family physician to be able to deal with 
everything, this is exactly what happens with the local veterinarian.?

WHITEHORSE, Yukon Territory--With governmental jurisdiction questions 
muddying the requirements for exporting and selling animals, the owners of the 
Yukon's only reindeer farm say they may have to kill their animals because they 
can't afford to keep them. 
Stella and Lloyd Gregory, owners of Northern Splendor Reindeer Farm north of 
Whitehorse, say they are not allowed by Yukon Territory laws to sell any of 
the reindeer. 
In an April 20 letter, Edward Huebert, the deputy minister of the Department 
of the Environment, wrote the Gregorys that the transfer of natural resource 
control from Ottawa to the territorial government had affected their ability to 
sell the reindeer. 
He said the reindeer are not considered game farm animals, which is a reason 
they're being held back. 
But two ministers argued recently that the Gregorys can export and sell the 
reindeer if they want to do so.

        <docText>The headlines said it all: Bullfighting was coming to China.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the bullring. In a country known for 
its often-brutal treatment of animals and its anything-goes capitalism, a 
public outcry halted the project in its tracks. Chagrined promoters are not 
talking, while emboldened activists voice hope that their win will help spur new 
laws to strengthen animal rights.
''This is a very significant victory," said Zhang Luping, head of the Beijing 
Human and Animal Environmental Education Center. ''It shows that ordinary 
people's voices can be heard in China and that policies can be changed."
The treatment of animals in China still leaves much to be desired. For-profit 
zoos often mistreat them, selling unwanted ones as exotic restaurant fare and 
feeding live animals to other beasts for visitors' amusement
There are thriving markets in ivory, fur, and various endangered-species 
parts for virility treatments. And live bears are ''milked" of their bile, used 
for medicine, with implanted catheters puncturing their gallbladders.
But animal rights groups say the attitudes of average Chinese are quickly 
changing.
Driving the shift, animal rights groups say, are economic, social, and 
cultural factors that suggest how quickly China is adapting to global sensibilities. 
''As people's lifestyles have improved, they've become more and more 
sensitive toward animals," said Wang Shi, secretary general of the Chinese Culture 
Promotion Society, a government-linked civic group.
New social structures also have heightened respect for the birds and the 
beasts. As growing numbers of people move from the countryside into urban 
apartments, the average family size is declining and the number of people living alone 
is rising.
This has spurred pet ownership as animals take on the role of companions. 
Beijing officials got a taste of the new attitude when they sought to discourage 
pet ownership through high license fees in 1995, a policy that was largely 
reversed under pressure from outspoken residents.
Activists and sociologists point out that harsh treatment of animals is not a 
Chinese tradition, at least not an old one. Rural culture has for centuries 
respected animals, which are seen as an important part of local life, the 
economy, and people's hopes for success.

The tradition of dog hunting in North Florida clashes with growing
development. Frustrated property owners want to ban the sport on private
land that once was open.
...
MARIANNA - John Daniel loves everything about his 800-acre property: the
cabin overlooking a tranquil pond, the wild turkeys scampering in the
brush, the whoosh of wind through the tall pine trees.

But Daniel dreads deer hunting season.

From October to February each year, the calm is shattered by barking
hounds chasing deer through Daniel's property and hunters tearing up and
down nearby roads in noisy trucks.

Like dozens of North Florida land owners, Daniel has complained to law
enforcement and state wildlife officers about the dogs and the hunters who
chase them.

But Daniel and other property owners say their complaints made them
targets of retribution, threats and even arson. Some even say that deer
innards are left in their driveways.

They blame dog hunters.

"They don't care about other people's property rights," said Daniel, who
says his home burned just days after pressing charges against a dog hunter
in 2001. "They need to leave us alone. I've had enough."

NEAH BAY -- The TV footage has been replayed over and over again.

A gray whale gliding near the Makah canoe, puffing mist into the air as it
surfaced.

The huge harpoon going in.

The whale recoiling, fleeing.

A speedboat pulling alongside and firing several shots that explode in the
sea.

More harpoons, more shots.

The whale thrashing, rolling.

The harpoon lines going slack. The sea filling with blood.
...
Now, five years later, intense reaction to the Makah killing its one and
only gray whale since the late 1920s has reverberated with court cases and
environmental requirements -- which have effectively stopped any new whale
hunts since 2000.
...
``It looks like the animal rights people got us where they want us,''
Makah Whaling Commission Vice President Arnie Hunter said in an interview
with the Peninsula Daily News last week.
...
The judges also ruled that a full environmental impact assessment must be
conducted, rather than a less involved environmental assessment, to
determine the impact of whaling on the whale population in the area of the
hunt off the tribe's Neah Bay reservation.

The court was ruling on a lawsuit filed by the Fund for Animals, the
Humane Society of the United States, Washington Citizen's Coastal Alliance
leader Dan Spomer of Sekiu, Chuck Owens of Joyce, co-founder of Peninsula
Citizens for the Protection of Whales, and other groups and individuals.

Whale hunts have also been opposed by some of the 1,800 members of the tribe.

OCEAN CITY -- The raccoons are coming. They want your trash, already
sniffing those aromatic banana peels and coffee grounds, and they'll
invade your garbage can to get it.

Wildlife control cooperators say they're ready for the onslaught.

A handful of people on the Eastern Shore are deputized by the state to
respond to complaints of raccoons in the garbage, squirrels in the attic
and even foxes in the henhouse.

They hold Department of Natural Resources wildlife control cooperator
permits that allow them to use animal traps year-round, beyond the winter
trapping season and for-hire. Picking up where common pest control
companies leave off, they are called to remove, and sometimes kill,
medium-to-large mammals that are bothering families at home, businesses or
farms. 
...
Trappers say that contrary to popular belief, animals they catch don't
have to die, and often don't, although wildlife cooperators are allowed to
kill animals and must do so if they could be rabid. Often, a trapper will
confiscate an animal and release it away from the built-up area. They say
this happens often with pets off leashes that come upon traps. Scents and
bait are used to lure animals into traps that snare their feet or grip
their whole bodies.
...
Animal rights groups often object to trapping practices. Bills that aimed
at forbidding the use of leghold traps, sponsored by several Western Shore
lawmakers, failed in the General Assembly this year.

VANCOUVER, B.C. - A Canadian immigration panel is considering whether
accused environmental saboteur Tre Arrow can apply for refugee status in
Canada.

Arrow, 30, who is wanted for fire bombing logging and cement trucks in
Oregon, asked the Canadian authorities to remain in Canada as a political
refugee at a hearing in Vancouver on Tuesday.

A key issue will be whether Arrow is affiliated with a terrorist group,
which would immediately disqualify him from receiving refugee status in
Canada, authorities said.

The new residences of the extremely 
endangered Chinese Tigers have been finally unveiled after two years' scientific 
inspection and research. 
    Zixi County in east China's Jiangxi Province and Liuyang City of central 
China's Hunan Province were selected by International Federation for Salvage 
of Chinese Tigers (SCT) as the experimental habitats for the rare animal 
species. 
    Quan Li, a Britain-born-Chinese, who is the founder of SCT, says this 
signifies China has taken a crucial step in saving Chinese Tigers. 
    The Chinese Tiger, from which other sub-species such as the Siberian 
Tiger evolved, is a critically endangered tiger sub-species native to south China. 
    Today, fewer than 30 Chinese Tigers remain in the wild while about 60 are 
kept in zoos. The total number of Chinese Tigers is even less than that of 
pandas and it is listed as one of the world's ten most endangered animals. 
    "Chinese Tigers prefer to live on the even grasslands, yet theyare forced 
to migrate into forests when their habitats were taken for industrial or 
agricultural uses and that is why they are on the verge of extinction now," says 
Quan.

When alive, the deep sea creature is elusive ? no confirmed sighting has ever 
been made

 
May 17, 2004


This could be a librarian's nightmare: Dig up enough data for a comprehensive 
report on Hector's beaked whale.

A specimen of Hector's beaked whale was found dead on a western Australia 
beach May 3. A photo showing what was left of the carcass was sent everywhere by 
the world's news services, piquing interest but supplying little data.

A search in marine mammal archives, such as the Audubon Society Guide to 
Marine Mammals of the World, yielded the following:

Recognition at sea: unknown. Behavior: unknown. Longevity: unknown. Estimated 
population: unknown. Influence of man: unknown. Habitat: prefers cool, 
temperate waters. Food and feeding: stomach analysis shows squid is the main food.

"Beaked whales really are an enigma," said whale biologist Phil Clapham, at 
the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service facility at Woods Hole, Mass.

They might be called rare, "but there's a difference between calling 
something rare because you know it's rare, or calling it rare because of its cryptic 
behavior. They are deep divers, and don't spend much time on the surface."

AUSTRALIAN Democrats MP Sandra Kanck has received abusive e-mails from around 
the world after calling for a cull of 20,000 koalas on South Australia's 
Kangaroo Island.

Ms Kanck said she had received dozens of the angry and abusive comments, 
including many from the United States, after her recent calls were reported on 
CNN. 
"Americans are easily the most vitriolic in their attacks, calling me, among 
other things a murderer, an assassin, a barbaric bitch and a sick and horrific 
person," she said. 
"But this type of abuse is water off a duck's back to me." 
Ms Kanck said most of the responses had a common theme: ignorance. 

  



"Some demand that a program of translocation of koalas be implemented, 
oblivious to the fact that such a program has been in operation since 1996 while the 
number of koalas has exploded from some 5000 to 30,000," she said. 
"Some accuse me of pandering to Australia's gun lobby. 
"Many use the absurd argument of comparing starving koalas to starving 
people, suggesting I must therefore support murder. 
"None seem to be aware that koalas are an introduced species to Kangaroo 
Island." 
Last month Ms Kanck said an urgent cull was necessary to avoid an 
environmental catastrophe.

In Maui?s Haleakala National Park, at an elevation of 7,000 feet, Hosmer 
Grove serves as a rather enchanting memorial to a failed experiment. In 1910, 
German-born Ralph Hosmer planted 86 varieties of non-native trees in Maui, 
including the eucalyptus trees that have now grown to great heights in the grove 
named after him. Although the attempt to find new forest crops for Hawaii was a 
commercial flop, Hosmer?s grove remains as a last holdout for many of the 
islands? increasingly endangered native birds, and it is still possible to see there 
such species as the apapane and the gorgeous i?iwi. 

Hawaiian native bird expert Renate Gassman says introduced predators (from 
tree-climbing rats to feral cats) have taken their toll on indigenous species 
like the i?iwi.
Jim Motavalli
The first human colonizers found 140 native breeding bird species in Hawaii, 
many of them found nowhere else, but half of them are now extinct. According 
to state accounts, 71 species remain, and 32 are federally listed, 15 of them 
either extinct or on the edge, with less than 500 individuals remaining. In 
fact, Hawaii has more endangered species than any other U.S. state.

Each quarter, one article in Healthy Animals focuses on a particular element 
of ARS animal research. The current issue looks at the National Agricultural 
Library's Animal Welfare Information Center, which was created in 1986 as a 
result of Congressional amendments to the 1985 Animal Welfare Act. The NAL 
website contains links to the latest government publications concerning farm and lab 
animals, as well as zoo and circus wildlife.
Other research highlighted in this issue includes:
A test to detect brucellosis-causing bacteria in goat milk. 
A capsule containing a temperature sensor and transmitter that, when 
swallowed, measures and sends cow body temperature readings. 
New swine influenza viruses created by researchers studying the viruses' 
components in order to develop new vaccines. 
A commercially available device called the "4-Poster" that helps control 
ticks on deer. 
Patented selection techniques to find "good" bacteria that help protect live 
chickens.

Undated ? (05/10/04) Plump whole chickens, choice cuts of beef, fresh grains, 
and all the wholesome nutrition your dog or cat will ever need. 
These are the images pet food manufacturers promulgate through the media and 
advertising. This is what the $11 billion per year U.S. pet food industry 
wants consumers to believe they are buying when they purchase their products. 
This report explores the differences between what consumers think they are 
buying and what they are actually getting. It focuses in very general terms on 
the most visible name brands -- the pet food labels that are mass-distributed 
to supermarkets and discount stores -- but there are many highly respected 
brands that may be guilty of the same offenses. 
What most consumers don't know is that the pet food industry is an extension 
of the human food and agriculture industries. Pet food provides a market for 
slaughterhouse offal, grains considered "unfit for human consumption," and 
similar waste products to be turned into profit. This waste includes intestines, 
udders, esophagi, and possibly diseased and cancerous animal parts. 
(for footnote references, click here). 
Three of the five major pet food companies in the United States are 
subsidiaries of major multinational companies: Nestl? (Alpo, Fancy Feast, Friskies, 
Mighty Dog, and Ralston Purina products such as Dog Chow, ProPlan, and Purina 
One), Heinz (9 Lives, Amore, Gravy Train, Kibbles-n-Bits, Nature's Recipe), 
Colgate-Palmolive (Hill's Science Diet Pet Food). Other leading companies include 
Procter &amp; Gamble (Eukanuba and Iams), Mars (Kal Kan, Mealtime, Pedigree, Sheba, 
Waltham's), and Nutro. From a business standpoint, multinational companies 
owning pet food manufacturing companies is an ideal relationship. The 
multinationals have increased bulk-purchasing power; those that make human food products 
have a captive market in which to capitalize on their waste products, and pet 
food divisions have a more reliable capital base and, in many cases, a 
convenient source of ingredients. 
There are hundreds of different pet foods available in this country. And 
while many of the foods on the market are similar, not all of the pet food 
manufacturing companies use poor quality or potentially dangerous ingredients. 
Ingredients 
Although the purchase price of pet food does not always determine whether a 
pet food is good or bad, the price is often a good indicator of quality. It 
would be impossible for a company that sells a generic brand of dog food at $9.95 
for a 40-lb. bag to use quality protein and grain in its food. The cost of 
purchasing quality ingredients would be much higher than the selling price. 
The protein used in pet food comes from a variety of sources. When cattle, 
swine, chickens, lambs, or other animals are slaughtered, the choice cuts such 
as lean muscle tissue are trimmed away from the carcass for human consumption. 
However, about 50% of every food-producing animal does not get used in human 
foods. Whatever remains of the carcass -- bones, blood, intestines, lungs, 
ligaments, and almost all the other parts not generally consumed by humans -- is 
used in pet food, animal feed, and other products. These "other parts" are 
known as "by-products," "meat-and-bone-meal," or similar names on pet food labels. 
The Pet Food Institute -- the trade association of pet food manufacturers -- 
acknowledges the use of by-products in pet foods as additional income for 
processors and farmers: "The growth of the pet food industry not only provided pet 
owners with better foods for their pets, but also created profitable 
additional markets for American farm products and for the byproducts of the meat 
packing, poultry, and other food industries which prepare food for human 
consumption."1 
Many of these remnants provide a questionable source of nourishment for our 
animals. The nutritional quality of meat and poultry by-products, meals, and 
digests can vary from batch to batch. James Morris and Quinton Rogers, two 
professors with the Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California 
at Davis Veterinary School of Medicine, assert that, "There is virtually no 
information on the bioavailability of nutrients for companion animals in many of 
the common dietary ingredients used in pet foods. These ingredients are 
generally by-products of the meat, poultry and fishing industries, with the 
potential for a wide variation in nutrient composition. Claims of nutritional adequacy 
of pet foods based on the current Association of American Feed Control 
Officials (AAFCO) nutrient allowances ('profiles') do not give assurances of 
nutritional adequacy and will not until ingredients are analyzed and bioavailability 
values are incorporated."2

The first El Paso test of a new, tougher state law on animal cruelty is
set for this summer.

Two years ago, Fabens resident Pablo Camarillo shot and killed his
neighbor's dog, which he suspected was killing his livestock.

Camarillo's lawyer says the Lower Valley farmer acted within his rights
when he killed the dog. But the dog's owner, Reuben Chavez, disagreed and
had law enforcement file a criminal charge of cruelty to animals against
Camarillo.

The case is set for trial this summer and is expected to become the first
El Paso animal cruelty case to go before a jury since a tougher state law
took effect in September.

Under the new law, some forms of animal cruelty may be prosecuted as a
state jail felony instead of a Class A misdemeanor. The punishment for a
state jail felony ranges from 180 days to two years in prison and a fine
of up to $10,000. A Class A misdemeanor is punishable by up to a year in
jail and a fine of up to $4,000.

When authorities raided a Franklin Township horse farm last fall and
charged Joseph Stuebing with animal cruelty, the New Jersey Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was among the investigators.

As the municipal trial continues over several months, dozens of Stuebing's
horses have remained under SPCA control.

Some involved in the ordeal say that, before last fall, they knew little
of the legal powers granted to the private animal welfare organization.

"We don't have private armies in our country," said Rev. Jeffrey Allen, a
Presbyterian minister who was a witness in the trial and volunteered
briefly at the Stuebing farm. "We don't have private police forces, but
they do specifically for the charges of animal cruelty."

Allen is among more than two dozen people involved in the Stuebing trial
who have petitioned state legislators and local officials to investigate
the scope of law enforcement powers granted to private citizens working
for the non-profit SPCA. Franklin Township Municipal Court Judge Charles
J. Sprigman Jr. is expected to rule in the case within two weeks.

        <docText>Force-feeding of ducks and geese to make
foie gras, a delicacy to some and an outrage to others, is a step closer
to being outlawed in California after the state senate's passage of a bill
on Tuesday.

The bill proposed by John Burton, the state Senate's top Democrat, would
also ban the sale of foie gras made from the enlarged livers of force-fed
geese and ducks.

The bill, passed on a vote of 21-14, now goes to the California Assembly,
where one lawmaker has also proposed a bill to ban farm-raised salmon in
the state.

Only one farm in California currently produces foie gras. If Burton's bill
becomes law, it would become effective in seven and a half years and would

A WEST Cumbrian man killed his dog by slitting its throat in front of his 
partner and two daughters in the village of Gosforth.

Derek Ian Ford, 50, had also stabbed the Border Collie, Jess, several times 
in the thigh before inflicting the fatal wound.

Whitehaven magistrates heard that the backlash in the village from the 
incident, on April 24, was so bad that Ford was forced to move away. He is now 
living in Runcorn, Cheshire. Ford admitted torturing the dog and causing it 
suffering, following an afternoon of heavy drinking in a pub in Gosforth with his 
partner.

The couple had been arguing about the dog, which Ford had taken in only a 
week before because its owner could no longer cope with it.

He took it to a vet and was given pills to calm it down, but it continued to 
prove extremely difficult to control ? running round, jumping and barking. 

That caused arguments between Ford and his partner.

Defending solicitor Ian Nancollis said that their row on the day of the 
incident tipped Ford over the edge.

He had been threatening to kill the dog and when he saw it, he picked it up 
by the scruff of the neck and stabbed it two or three times in the thigh area 
with an eight-inch knife.

He then brought the knife under the dog?s throat and sliced it across. 

Ford had also stabbed himself in the leg during the attack .

He was found by police lying face down behind a parked car.

Officers were unsure if he still had the knife with him and he was bitten by 
a police dog and sprayed with CS spray while he was being arrested.

Mr Nancollis said Ford, who has no previous convictions, suffered from a 
stress-related illness, which had forced him to give up work.

He had been receiving treatment for some time but his condition had been 
exacerbated by excessive drinking, family issues and trouble with the dog.

Mr Nancollis said: ?Unfortunately it seems it has tipped him over the edge 
and he has lot control.

?He is extremely remorseful and terrified by the way he has behaved,? he 
said.

?I don?t really think he can apologise enough.

?He has always prided himself on caring for animals in the past and looking 
after them properly.

?This is clearly an appalling incident and one that he deeply regrets.?

With high-spirits and strong guts, many people from all corners of the 
country take table-exoticas like frogs, ant eggs, locusts, crickets (kamaru,) dogs 
(as Azucena,) and duck eggs (balut) for their unique taste, and?believed to be?
potent effects. 
 Azucena (out of dogmeat) is an exotic food, widely eaten by Filipinos both 
in cities and rural areas because it is affordable and sometimes free. And as 
part of the exotic fiasco, stealing a neighbor?s dog is part of the whole 
process. 
Early during morning, the men from   dog pounds  are already roving the 
streets, looking or hunting for stray dogs?creatures that are candidates for being 
an azucena. Even in the earlier days, people from Northern Luzon, practice dog 
hunting, and cooking to feed prisoners from other tribes. For so, the custom 
of eating of man?s best friend has been going on for a long time?mostly 
prevalent to our brothers in the Mountain Province.  According to the writings of 
the Commissioner of Health in 1905, Mr. Victor Heiser, On the Benguet Road I 
often see Filipinos bound for the Saturday dog market at Baguio, each dragging 
along on a leash. This custom is however ruled out, at present, by ordinances 
and laws of pro-life organizations. 
However, in reality, people still eat dogs in the outskirts of Sagada, and 
illegal restaurants in Pangasinan; more or less, dog dishes like mechado and 
adobo are served in demand. Not to mention, even in progressive cities, despite 
laws and tight availability.
Usually Drunkards who can?t wait for regular dogmeat peddlers, dognap their 
neighbors? pets, or dogs wandering the streets. Dog thieves snatch the poor 
animal, and load it into a sack and kill it by striking a hard material on its 
head; then roast it over an open fire?a procedure to easily brush off the fur. 
Then, they wash the meat and cook it in their own preference. Caldereta, and 
adobo are some the most favorite Azucena dishes, and go best with beer or gin.
Another way of preparing it is starving the poor animal, then feeding it with 
rice until its belly bulge, full, before a swift kill, followed by the 
roasting method. After roasting, the undigested rice inside the dog?s stomach will 
be steamed naturally. Soon after, the coal-blistered animal?s belly is cut, 
open, and the rice will be eaten as a festive meal. It is said to be the greatest 
delicacy in the old days. Some lop its head, letting the blood flow, then cut 
its body open, the innards are removed and  usually cooked into tinumis. 
While its raw skin and liver are soaked in vinegar, garlic and onions, and made 
into kinilaw. 
Also, Dog blood is believed to be nutritious and beneficial to TB patients. 
Sufferers insert a straw into the animals jugular vein, to immediately suck the 
blood fresh. Also, as a myth, azucena is noted to be a great aphrodisiac, 
making the body extremely hot. But, like Ginseng roots, and other Aphrodisiacs, 
there is no concrete proof available to support this claim.

"Joe was my first working cow horse and he was awesome. I sold him when he 
was 22 and every time I saddle up to work cattle I think about how much I miss 
him. One of my fondest memories was returning home to a message on the 
answering machine that my bull was out with a neighbor's cows. 
I rode the 640-acre pasture, sorted the bull from 150 cow/calf pairs and 
drove him a half-mile home within 45 minutes. Riding a horse that knows how, where 
and when to work cattle is a feeling that is hard to describe but wonderful 
to experience. 
I clearly recall my final months with Joe. I was reluctant to part company 
with him. In the final year, I didn't dare saddle him because of the stiffness 
in his legs. Age and dedication to his mission had taken their toll on him. 
I finally bit the bullet and sold him for a whopping $280. (Apparently and 
proudly to the slaughter plant)...Most importantly, no one is mandating how your 
horse leaves this life so why should you tell me how mine should be allowed 
to die?"
So, let me see if I understand you, Mr. Loos. Joe was an awesome horse. You 
loved him enough not to try to ride him the last year because he was too stiff 
and sore. In addition, you acknowledge that he had worn himself out dedicating 
himself to the mission of supporting you. Therefore, in gratitude, you sold 
that poor, pain-filled horse for a "whopping $280" to a killer buyer. 
Your horse got forced up a slippery metal ramp into the bowels of a 
double-decker truck and had to crouch on stiff, pain-racked legs, crammed in with other 
horses on a long, thirsty ride to a slaughter plant and off-loaded in agony. 
Looking for you, he saw only strangers that forced him down a chute into a 
box and left him swaying on those same, stiff legs until they shot a bolt into 
his head enough times for him to fall down and wait to be hoisted by a leg and 
have his throat slit. 
The only thing I can say is that I'm sure glad you don't love me! Your 
sentence about "Horses, like man, will die and death with a purpose gives full 
meaning to life", scares me half to death. I'd hate to be your worn out mother, 
grown old in dedication to my mission of raising you.

One of the stars of the upcoming New Line Cinema comedy "Harold &amp; Kumar Go
to White Castle" is a committed vegetarian.

Not only that, Kal Penn - who plays Kumar in the buddy movie, about a
quest to satisfy an unreasoning craving for dead cow - refused to eat
White Castle beef for the camera, and instead insisted on veggie burgers.

Not only that, Penn - who has agreed, for the sake of Hollywood hype, to
go to Columbus, Ohio, tomorrow to be inducted into something called the
White Castle Hall of Fame - has a brother who works full-time for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Yesterday, the 26-year-old, New Jersey-born Penn, whose real name is
Kaplen Modi, befitting the son of Hindus from Bombay, told me he plans to
present White Castle execs in Ohio with a PETA-produced position paper
urging the inclusion of veggie burgers on the menu.

By last November, it was too late. Four times in the previous 15 months,
federal inspectors had cited Sea Life Park on the Hawaiian island of Oahu
for not providing its aging and frail marine mammals with adequate
veterinary care.
...
A South Florida Sun-Sentinel investigation found that the federal
government is slow to enforce laws meant to protect marine mammals and has
allowed violators to continue operating for years even after documenting
contaminated water, starvation or deaths such as Laukani's.
...
It took a complaint from an animal rights activist to bring official
action against the Miami Seaquarium. Last fall, county building inspectors
threatened to shut the park down after documenting 125 code violations,
including some that may have endangered animals, the county's building
chief said.The Seaquarium's last three USDA inspection reports say: "No
non-compliances identified.''
...
For the most part, the lone voice for the marine mammals comes from a
small band of animal rights advocates. Splintered and disorganized, the
activists are dismissed as extremists and fanatics by many politicians and
industry officials.

WASHINGTON ? They are bombing buildings; sending death threats; committing
arson, extortion, burglary and sabotage; and urging followers to wage war
along with them.

The Bush administration said Tuesday that those activities qualify extreme
animal-rights activists as terrorists, and Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch agreed. But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
committee's ranking Democrat, scoffed at that.

"Most Americans would not consider the harassment of animal testing
facilities to be 'terrorism' any more than they would consider
anti-globalism protesters or anti-war protesters or women's health
activists to be terrorists," Leahy said in a statement for a hearing on
animal rights extremists

"This administration aggressively stamps everything with a 'terrorism' label."
...
The owners of Kentucky Fried Chicken also asked Hatch not just to protect
animal researchers but companies that produce or sell meat. They are
targeted by less extreme groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals.

Jonathan Blum, senior vice president of KFC's parent company, Yum! Brands,
said harassment and threats from PETA have left many KFC executives to
seek around-the-clock police protection.

An animal rights organization Wednesday called on Florida Attorney General
Charlie Crist to investigate alleged cocaine use at dog tracks across the
state, including the Fort Myers-Naples track in Bonita Springs.

The Bonita track leads the state with 10 greyhounds testing positive for
cocaine during the past three years, said Christine A. Dorchak, vice
president of the national GREY2K USA greyhound protection organization
headquartered in Somerville, Mass.

Overall, 119 dogs at Florida?s 18 greyhound tracks have tested positive
for cocaine during that time period, she said.

Her group and The Humane Society of the United States are asking Crist to
conduct a special investigation into the problem so that both the dogs and
the public are protected, Dorchak said.

The national centre for will promote the "3Rs"
The UK Government is tomorrow expected to announce a radical shake-up in the 
way animal experiments are controlled. 
Science minister Lord Sainsbury will outline proposals likely to include the 
creation of a new national centre for "best practice" in animal testing. 
The new institute will seek to reduce numbers of experiments carried out on 
animals and raise standards of welfare. 
The move comes after plans for a primate research centre were shelved, in the 
wake of angry protests. 
The main aim of this initiative will be to encourage - and fund - research 
into the so-called "three R's": the replacement, reduction and refinement of the 
use of animals in experiments. 
This will include exploring alternatives such as computer simulations and 
experiments on cultured cells. 
The National Centre for the 3R's will provide a hub that will monitor and 
promote best practice in nationwide centres of excellence and science. 
It will be linked to - and build upon - the Medical Research Council's 
existing centre for best practice. 
Welcome move

UNC has once again come under allegations of animal mistreatment from People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights organization which 
carried out an investigation in the Thurston Bowles science building. An unnamed 
undercover investigator documented the alleged abuses over the span of nearly a 
year. 
UNC has once again come under fire from People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals, which is requesting medical organizations to revoke federal funding to 
the University after evidence of laboratory animal abuse.
An undercover investigator for the animal rights group employed by the 
University documented the abuse in the Thurston Bowles science building, the same 
building where PETA had made similar allegations of abuse in 2002.
The investigator, who documented the abuse from January to November, was not 
identified because she is now participating in another investigation.
Her investigation revealed instances of animal abuse including mice with 
oversized tumors that had ulcerated and burst, seriously sick and injured animals 
left to die without any veterinary care and severe overcrowding, leading to 
"cannibalism and suffocation."
  
PETA's report against UNC cites numerous instances of animal abuse, including 
improper veterinary care and mice with oversized tumors that had ulcerated. 
The investigator also found instances of clipping animals' toes for the 
purpose of identification and improper euthanization techniques. In one instance, a 
guillotine blade was so dull that two fully conscious rats' necks were hacked 
twice in order to sever their heads from their bodies, said Mary Beth 
Sweetland, a PETA senior vice president.

        <docText>In a landmark decision, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO) has agreed to reexamine a patent on beagle dogs following a legal 
challenge filed in February by two non-profit organizations, the American 
Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) and the PatentWatch Project of the International Center 
for Technology Assessment (ICTA). In the challenge, the groups urged the 
Patent Office to cancel Patent # 6,444,872, which covers live beagle dogs and was 
issued to the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System (UT) in 
Austin, Texas. The dogs claimed in the patent are intended for use in experiments. 
"It is fundamentally illegitimate and flawed to consider any animal to be 
patentable subject matter," said AAVS President Sue Leary, "and defined as a 
machine, an article of manufacture, or an inventor's composition of matter. The 
horrible treatment of these patented dogs is a disgraceful illustration of the 
convergence of bad science and bad policy." 
Specifically, numbers 1 through 4 of the patent's claims cover "a canine 
model [of fungal lung infection]," and the remaining claims pertain to the various 
methods used to induce a fatal lung infection in the dogs. The patent also 
indicated applying the methods to pigs, sheep, monkeys, or chimpanzees and, like 
many other patents on animals, now appears to be exclusively licensed to a 
private company. 
"Dogs clearly are not patentable machines or articles of manufacture," says 
Andrew Kimbrell, Executive Director of ICTA. "This decision, hopefully, is a 
first step in our government recognizing this and rescinding patents on 
animals."

        <docText>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Inspector
General has launched an investigation into allegations an agency
supervisor in Texas violated federal policy and ordered that a suspect cow
not be tested for mad cow disease, United Press International has learned.

"There was enough information that we decided we needed to independently
investigate," David Gray, special counsel to the USDA's Office of
Inspector General, told UPI.

"Media accounts reported that USDA procedures were not followed and USDA
officials directed the testing not occur, so we want to learn the facts,"
Gray added.

USDA policy is to test all cows with signs of a brain disorder or central
nervous system problems for mad cow disease, because this can be an
indication the animal is infected. However, the policy was breached on
April 27 by USDA inspectors at Lone Star Beef Processors in San Angelo,
Texas, when an animal displaying CNS signs was not tested.

The meatingplace.com, a Web site that covers the meat industry, reported
earlier this month that unnamed government and industry sources, who
claimed to have firsthand knowledge of the Texas incident, said a USDA
employee in Austin -- more than 200 miles from Lone Star Beef -- overruled
the agency inspectors at the plant and made the decision not to test the cow.

        <docText>The Detroit Zoo will become the nation's first major animal
facility to give away its elephants solely on ethical grounds.

Winky and Wanda, the latest in an 81-year-old tradition of pachyderms at
the zoo, will be sent to one of two U.S. refuges this summer or early fall.
...
Even though the Detroit Zoo is "head and shoulders above" other zoos in
terms of animal treatment, the decision was the right one, said Debbie
Leahy, captive-animal specialist with People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. "He's the first one to say elephants don't belong in zoos."

Detroit's elephants might go to the Tennessee sanctuary, which by year's
end will have 2,700 acres of fenced land for them to roam. Or, they might
go to a similar sanctuary in California, the Performing Animal Welfare
Society preserve.

TRADING in domestic cat and dog fur would be banned in Australia, Justice
and Customs Minister Chris Ellison said today.

After months of lobbying from animal rights groups, the Government had
decided to amend customs regulations to outlaw domestic cat and dog fur
imports and exports, he said.

Three animal-rights activists, including one dressed in a chicken suit,
stopped by Capitol Middle School on Thursday to provide the students a
lesson: Don't eat chickens.

But they mistimed their visit. School let out about noon, two hours
earlier than normal. Thursday was also the last day of school for the
2003-2004 school year.

So the activists from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or
PETA, had to try to persuade a handful of neighborhood children who rode
or walked by.

Activist Matt Rice said the threesome had already been to 20 states,
handing out literature to students as they left school. They were raising
awareness of the "short, miserable lives of American chickens," and the
health dangers for the children who eat them.

The government today launched its plans for a new centre to research
alternatives to animal research.

The science minister, Lord Sainsbury, claimed that the new centre would
help eliminate any unnecessary experiments on animals and the move was
immediately welcomed by the science community.

However, animal rights campaigners immediately condemned the move as a
"fig leaf" to hide the real issue that experimentation involving animals
was harmful and of little benefit.

The centre will work on the principal of the three Rs - replacement,
reduction and refinement. The Office for Science and Technology has
doubled its funding for alternatives to animal research from ?330,000 to
?660,000.

Neighbourhood Watch groups for swans are being set up to stop an increasing 
number of savage attacks on the birds.

PC Ray Adams said a number of self-styled neighbourhood action groups had 
sprung up in areas near where swans nest to maintain a vigilant lookout for 
heartless thugs.

At the weekend, a mother swan suffered a fatal attack in Exeter. She was one 
of six breeding pairs in the city, and nested on the banks of the Exe at 
Weirfield Road.

The swan died at the Taunton RSPCA centre, where she was treated for a leg 
injury. She had suffered a catalogue of abuse at the hands of local vandals, 
including being urinated on and having large objects thrown at her nest.

PC Adams said the horrific mistreatment was not an isolated incident.

He said: "Unfortunately there seems to be a minority of idiot yobs who take 
some sort of pleasure stoning swans, throwing skateboards at them and generally 
trying to inflict as much injury as they possibly can."

But he had been heartened by public response to the graceful creatures' 
plight. "Local people are rallying to the support of the breeding swans," he said.

"They have formed groups to keep an eye out and keep guard on the nests to 
make sure people are not mistreating the swans in any way."

He said residents in homes overlooking the nest, where the distraught male 
swan has been left to look after the cygnets alone, were keeping watch. But he 
did not expect the young birds to survive.

He said: "We are disgusted by the actions of these mindless thugs. I am sure 
I speak for most of Exeter when I say local people are fed up with it."

Swans, which mate for life, have suffered a sickening array of violent 
attacks over the past 12 months.

In March, staff at Mid Devon's Grand Western Canal Park threatened to take 
legal action against the tormentors of nesting swans.

And in the last year a swan deliberately targeted in a Saltash breeze block 
attack narrowly escaped death.

In Paignton, Torbay Wildlife Rescue Service offered a ?3,000 reward for any 
information leading to the capture of a thug who beat a swan to death.

LIMERICK Animal Welfare are struggling to make ends meet, as the number of 
abused and mistreated animals continue to rise in the city.

Spokesperson for the group, Niamh Allen said that the dogs (pictured 
alongside) were left starving to death in a city housing estate, yet no-one thought of 
contacting the voluntary organisation, until it was too late for one helpless 
pup.

"We got a call from a caring lady who was very concerned about two pups. We 
went straight away but tragically when we got there one of the pups had been 
killed on the road by a car. We managed to rescue her sister who we named Cara. 
She is around ten weeks old and has hardly any hair due to scabies mange. She 
is also extremely malnourished and is full of fleas and worms,? said Ms Allen.

She said that they also rescued a Springer called Georgie in the same area, 
who is only around three years old, but looks years older as he is suffering 
from malnutrition, and he may go blind as his eyes are badly infected with 
scabies mange.

Ms Allen said that everyone loves cute and cuddly pups, but the state of 
these dogs is an example of the daily reality of their work.

She said that they are desperately in need of more funding to start building 
the first phase of their animal sanctuary in KIlfinane, Co Limerick, so that 
they have proper accommodation and facilities to care for these animals.

A look at apparent greenhouse gas effects reported by scientists and other 
observers:

Oceans

Seas rose throughout 20th century, and over past decade they rose at 
accelerated rate of one-tenth an inch (0.25 centimeter) per year. Levels are rising 
because water expands as it grows warmer and because of runoff of melting ice 
from continents.

Islands 

Islanders in the Pacific and elsewhere report steady erosion of shorelines 
from rising seas. Some small, low-lying islands have vanished beneath waves.

Arctic

In late summers, ice over the Arctic Ocean is believed to be only 60 percent 
as thick as a few decades ago. It is believed to cover 10-15 percent less area 
than it did at that time.

Animals

Birds, seals, polar bears, and other northern animals could be severely 
affected by the shrinking of Arctic ice, their habitat. Biologists find polar bears 
are losing weight because of reduced hunting time on ice.

Tundra

Spring temperatures in the Alaskan Arctic were as much as 7 F (3.9 C) warmer 
in 2000 than in 1971. Permafrost ? tundra ? is melting, buckling roads and 
damaging other infrastructure. Shrubs have moved into treeless areas.

Glaciers 

Mountain glaciers beat a widespread retreat in nonpolar regions during the 
20th century. Some European glaciers have shrunk by 50 percent. Only 27 glaciers 
remain of the previous 150 in Montana's Glacier National Park.

Snow

Global snow cover is believed to have decreased by 10 percent since satellite 
observations began in the 1960s.

SPRINGFIELD - A DeKalb company that plans to restart its horse slaughtering 
operation this month would be barred from selling the meat for human 
consumption under legislation approved Wednesday by a Senate committee.

Setting aside warnings that the bill might actually lead to more abused and 
neglected horses, the Senate Executive Committee voted 9-2 to send the measure 
to the full Senate.

Actress Bo Derek, speaking for the National Horse Protection Coalition, told 
the committee that America should not turn horses into food for other nations.

"They are not livestock," she said. "They're raised as pets. They're raised 
for sport."

The bill's critics say slaughterhouses provide a way for people to get rid of 
unwanted horses. If the practice is banned, the critics say, people who can't 
afford to keep a horse or to have it euthanized are more likely to neglect or 
abuse the animal.

The Animal Liberation Front is claiming responsibility for breaking into a
Brigham Young University barn and releasing a small number of rabbits and
birds.

BYU spokeswoman Carrie Jenkins said Friday that between 2:30 p.m. on
Sunday and 8 a.m. on Monday an unknown number of suspects entered the
small barn through a window. 
...
The Salt Lake Tribune received an e-mail Friday from Bite Back magazine,
based in Florida, which advertises Animal Liberation Front activities.

The e-mail says the group released six rabbits, five finches and two
doves, though Jenkins was unable to confirm the number of missing animals.

Animal-control and humane officials from across Southern California have
joined forces with customs agents to stop smugglers from hauling hundreds
of sick Mexican puppies into the state.

Since the agencies began sharing information in April, customs officers
daily have turned back 10 to 20 vehicles, each carrying as many as three
dozen puppies headed across the border for quick resale, said Lt. Mary Kay
Gagliardo with San Diego County's Department of Animal Services.
...
Two weeks ago at the border, her department confiscated 34 small-breed
pups and three exotic birds, she said. Some puppies, only 3 weeks old when
they were seized, now are dying from the highly contagious parvovirus.

Moreno Valley Animal Services is investigating several complaints from
people who have bought sick puppies from private sellers, including one
who admitted getting puppies in Mexico.

Carole Walker will miss watching the two gray Asian elephants from her window 
as she washes her dishes. 
Walker lives in Huntington Woods -- right next to the Detroit Zoo in Royal 
Oak. Her house on Huntington Road faces the zoo's elephant enclosure, where 
Wanda and Winky play and greet visitors. 
But soon, Walker will have new neighbors. The elephants are being moved to a 
place that more closely resembles their natural environment.The Free Press 
reported Thursday that zoo Director Ron Kagan plans to send the elephants to a 
refuge this summer or fall, making the zoo the first in the country to give away 
elephants for ethical reasons. 
Wanda suffers from arthritis in her front legs, and Winky has foot problems. 
Kagan contends the animals will have a healthier environment in a larger 
setting. 
The elephants will be moved to a sanctuary in Tennessee or California where 
they can roam more freely, Kagan said. He said he has gotten dozens of e-mails 
and calls -- most are supportive of his decision but also express surprise. 
Rana Kozouz, the zoo's spokeswoman, said responses flooded into the zoo 
Thursday from at least 14 states. She said most people expressed excitement about 
the decision, calling it the honorable thing to do.

A Chinese chef fired from 12 different jobs over his refusal to cook wild
animals was given a special award by conservationists last week.

And, odd though it may seem in a country boasting one of the
fastest-growing economies on the planet and one of only three nations
capable of putting people into space, that?s a remarkable story here.
...
Sceptics this week are saying the country has more chance of getting a man
on the moon in that timeframe than it does protecting the basic rights of
animals. To the dismay of the small band of activists here, last week also
saw the dramatic suspension of historic animal welfare draft legislation
that would, for the first time, have provided legally enshrined rules on
animal wellbeing.

The draft, published on the local government?s website for public
consultation ? before being withdrawn four days later ? included specific
requirements on raising animals in captivity, guarantees of decent living
conditions, methods of transportation and slaughter.
...
Wuhan-based legal expert Qiao Xinsheng voiced what many think: ?As soon as
you talk about animal rights, you?re talking about money. Our farms are
small, poorly ventilated buildings. Our slaughterhouses are not modern.
How can you expect a farmer in China to copy the West?

EDMONTON -- Howard the dolphin's relocation papers have been signed,
sealed and delivered. The permit to move West Edmonton Mall's most popular
resident to his new home, the Florida Keys Theater of the Sea, has been
given the green light by the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

Mall general manager Gary Hanson couldn't say when Howard would leave his
home of almost two decades, but he plans to talk to Theater of the Sea
next week to arrange the move.

Animal welfare organizations have lobbied for a new home for Howard, whose
health has declined since his companion, Mavis, died last July.

"During the night to May 19th, members of the Swedish ALF broke into a
building belonging to Goete Olofsson, Selkna gard, Uppsala, in Sweden.
Inside the building thousands of rats and mice were found in horrible
conditions.

This breeder has a permit to breed 100 guinea pigs for the vivisection
industry every year and was raided by another animal rights group in 1998,
when all animals on the farm, 92 guinea pigs, were liberated. After that
raid the breeder said he would quit, but has now instead built new
buildings and started to breed rats and mice.

The ALF rescued as many animals as possible that could be rehomed. Several
hundreds of rats, some mice and also 20 chickens that were bred in the
facilities were liberated.

... The South Florida Sun-Sentinel published a fascinating series
investigating the dark side of the marine theme park industry and its
adorable dolphins, whales and sea lions. Also in the news: the horrible
death of 3-year-old Angel Hope Herrera, allegedly at the hands of a mother
who spent her childhood being abused while the state was supposed to be
protecting her.

Do you really have to ask which got the bigger response?

Readers by the score called and wrote about the marine mammals. Herrera's
death didn't provoke one letter to the editor or any reader calls to the
reporters who covered it.
...
Sally Kestin, the investigative reporter who spent eight months on the
marine park series, isn't surprised about the disparity. Kestin once
covered Florida's dysfunctional child welfare system for the paper. She
recalls doing horrific stories about abuse cases and getting a handful of
calls. Two years ago, she did a series on dogs and cats being euthanized
at animal shelters and got more than 500 responses.

And then there's the reporter who did a series on homelessness and a week
later asked the letters editor how much response it generated. Nothing.
Then she did a story about a cat needing a home and got 38 phone calls.

Karen Lacov, 43, of Pembroke Pines said she called to praise the marine
series because, "It just touched a nerve."

Quick, does Matthew Scully sound like a Republican?

He wants increased government regulations of corporations that
mass-produce animals for slaughter. He is against "free-market" techniques
of conservation, in which some animals are killed or captured in order to
raise money to protect others. He wants the Internal Revenue Service to
investigate the Safari Club, a powerful hunting advocacy group.

Scully may sound like a liberal, but he is a conservative with impeccable
credentials: He works in the White House as a speechwriter for President Bush.

He has also emerged as a potent voice for animal welfare in what is widely
regarded as a red-meat White House. Groups fighting animal cruelty
consider him a powerful advocate, and Scully is helping to advance their
issues.

"He has had a substantial positive impact," said Wayne Pacelle, the chief
executive-designate of the Humane Society of the United States, who
credited the White House for being open to Scully's views. "I don't say
this lightly: He's a hero to animal advocates across the country." 
...
Scully, a vegetarian for 30 years, talked about individual responsibility
when discussing a hog farm he saw in North Carolina where pigs spend
entire lives in narrow crates.

WASHINGTON - Some states and cattle groups are urging
the Department of Agriculture to weaken a ban on
consumption of "downer" cows imposed after last year's
mad cow case. But public comments are running roughly
10-1 in favor of keeping the ban, an AP review found.
The USDA issued the ban in December after a Holstein
cow tested positive for mad cow disease in Washington
state, the first reported case in the United States.
The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service
maintains that the cow was a downer - one too sick to
stand or walk on its own - although some witnesses
have challenged that.
Under the ban, downer cows may not be slaughtered for
human consumption. Such animals must be condemned.
The USDA just finished a public comment period on
whether to keep, scrap or revise the ban. The
Inspection Service's acting administrator, Barbara
Masters, will make that decision, although there is no
time frame, agency spokesman Steven Cohen said.
The AP review covered written comments currently on
file at the USDA, but the agency has not yet filed all
the comments it has received. Those received by e-mail
are also not on file.
People who eat meat contaminated by mad cow disease -
formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE - can get a fatal variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
Supporters of the ban cite health concerns and
compassion as reasons to keep it in place. Cattle
groups, meanwhile, argue the ban should apply to
diseased animals, but not to injured ones, which the
group says pose no health risk to humans.
"If these (injured) animals are condemned, rather than
slaughtered, then producers will suffer an unnecessary
economic loss," the National Milk Producers Federation
wrote. "Condemning animals suffering from a physical
injury such as a broken leg does not seem to be
supported by science with respect to BSE risk."
The group, based in Arlington, Va., acknowledges that
downer cows have a higher risk for mad cow disease.
But it says human health would not be jeopardized if
the USDA allowed injured cattle to be slaughtered for
food, provided they are tested for disease first. Most
"downers" are old dairy cows whose meat can bring
farmers a little extra revenue.
Wisconsin, which is second in the nation in dairy
production, also urged the USDA to allow consumption
of injured cattle. The state's director of meat safety
and inspection, Terry Burkardt, called condemning
animals with broken bones "a waste of wholesome food
and an economic burden" on small farmers and meat
establishments.
Burkardt estimated the rule would preclude 3,000
"otherwise healthy, freshly-injured cattle" from the
Wisconsin food supply, or about 2.4 million pounds of
meat a year.
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arizona and West Virginia
filed similar comments.
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, based in
Centennial, Colo., asked the USDA to allow for the
personal (as opposed to commercial) consumption of
downer cattle injured during transport.
Jeffrey Farris of Ellsworth, Wis., who slaughters
livestock on farms, said his business has suffered in
the ban's wake.
"I don't have a problem with the ban on 'sick'
downers, but what about the 'healthy' animal that
slips and falls, and either breaks a leg or 'splits
out?'" wrote Farris. "Those animals don't have
anything to do with BSE, so why the ban on
slaughtering them?"
In an interview, Farris said about 30 percent of his
business comes from downer animals. He's had to lay
off two of his six employees because of the ban.
The Humane Society of the United States argues that
any weakening of the ban would both pose a health risk
and subject cows to suffering. The Washington-based
group says USDA veterinarians would be hard-pressed to
tell if a cow with a broken bone is disease-free.
"It would be impossible for them to determine whether
a physical injury is derivative of a neurological
disorder or other illness," the Humane Society wrote.
"It is well established that illness and injury are
often interrelated."
The group called the use of downer cattle "one of the
ugliest aspects of modern agriculture," noting that
such animals are often dragged in chains or pushed in
bulldozers. It says downers should be euthanized
humanely rather than brought to slaughterhouses.
The Humane Society got many of its members to weigh in
during the public comment period. A typical letter
urged the USDA to keep the ban in place, and to expand
it to other animals such as pigs, sheep and goats.
But some were more personal and emotional.
"All downed animals that are marketed and brought to
slaughter are subjected to horrendous cruelties; often
they are dragged to slaughter by their tails and ears,
or dumped and left to die in agony," wrote Shari Lewis
Thompson of New York City. "Each and every one of them
suffers unimaginable pain and fear."

The number one thing that we do wrong-and I am speaking from many years of
doing this myself-is that we place personal purity ahead of being as
effective as possible for animals. We lose sight of the fact that veganism
is not an end in and of itself but rather a means of ending cruelty to
animals. Being vegan is not about being perfect and causing no cruelty at
all-it's about decreasing suffering as effectively as possible. 

We all know this, but it bears repeating: At some level, everything we
consume harms some animals. Every non-organic thing we eat involves
pesticides that kill birds and other small animals. Organic foods use animal
fertilizer. Harvesting vegan foods kills and displaces animals. Bike tires
and even "vegan" shoes contain some small amount of animal product. We could
all go out into the woods and live on nuts and berries as "level 10 vegans,"
but ultimately, that would be far less effective than living where we could
influence others to adopt a vegan diet as well.

Animals don't need your purity, or else it would make sense to go live in a
cabin in the woods, causing as little harm as possible. What the animals
need is your advocacy-and they need for it to be as effective and
influential as possible. Ultimately, veganism can't just be about us, or it
will become just one more narcissistic cultural fad. Veganism must be about
helping animals.

So the issue of personal purity becomes one of basic math: Adopting a vegan
diet means you're not supporting the torment and slaughter of dozens of
animals every single year. Helping just one more person to go vegan will
save twice as many animals. But the reverse is also true: If you do
something that prevents another person from adopting a vegan diet, if your
example puts up a barrier where you might have built a bridge, that hurts
animals-so then it becomes anti-vegan, if vegan means helping animals.

A pregnant sea lion at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, Calif., 
jumped to her death into an empty pool four years ago as workers cleaned the 
exhibit.

The chlorine level in tanks at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium last year was 
so high that dolphins couldn't fully open their eyes and their skin peeled off.

Blisters developed on the eyes of a sea lion kept in a pool that didn't have 
enough shade at the North Carolina Zoological Park.

Despite veterinary medical advances and decades of trial and error, marine 
mammals in parks, aquariums and zoos have continued to get sick and die from 
such seemingly preventable causes as accidents, contaminated water and 
stress-related ulcers, a South Florida Sun-Sentinel investigation found. They've eaten 
key chains, sunglasses and rocks. They've died while being treated for common 
ear and teeth infections.

Maria, a bottlenose dolphin caught off Florida in 1984, spent the rest of her 
life until 2000 on display and performing at the West Edmonton Mall in 
Canada. She died after swallowing coins thrown into her tank, said mall spokesman 
Martin Schuldhaus.

"It's not uncommon,'' he said. "It's happened at a number of places, 
unfortunately.''

Rocky, an 8-year-old sea lion at the zoological park in Asheboro, N.C. 
"almost made a complete recovery'' from a 1994 root canal but died 11 hours later, 
according to a death report the zoo provided to the newspaper. "We have no 
clear explanation for this animal's unexplained postoperative death.''

London: A genetically modified plant that produces all the healthy fats
found in oily fish has been developed by British scientists.

The weedy type of cress was changed to make it rich in polyunsaturated
fats known as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The fats are believed to
help reduce heart disease and, according to some scientists, improve brain
function and mood.

Baoxiu Qi and Colin Lazarus, plant biologists at Bristol University,
developed it as an alternative source of the fats. Oily fish are
especially rich in omega-3. Omega-6 is found in certain grains and poultry.

The cress was modified with genes from three micro-organisms and its
production of the fats, and some hope plants will become a viable
alternative source of the oils. "The next step is to add the same set of
genes to leafy salad vegetables such as spinach and lettuce," Dr Lazarus said.

The use of modified plants would take the pressure off depleted fish
stocks. Oils made from the plants are also likely to be more pure than
many fish oil supplements. People with diets lacking in the fats from
fish, such as vegans, may benefit.
...
Britain's Vegan Society was also sceptical. "At the end of the day this is
not about human good; it's about making a profit," a spokesman said.

Vegetarian cat and dog owners are faced with a difficult decision when it
comes to feeding their carnivores: vegetarian in concert with their
beliefs or red meat in concert with what cats and dogs need? Now there's
an answer, and one that's becoming increasingly available.

Ruffy is a vegetarian. Bounding circles and chasing her own tail, Ruffy,
an 11-year-old medium-sized terrier mix, is also extremely excited about
dinnertime. Which is right about now.

"I usually put some grated carrot on top, but today it's banana--I've got
to get rid of them before they go bad," says her owner, Marian
Hailey-Moss, a Manhattan therapist. Ruffy bounds out of the kitchen, turns
in a circle, tail wagging, makes a kind of whining, snuffling noise, then
bounds back into the kitchen again. "Sometimes, since she's on a diet, I
feed her cottage cheese, oatmeal and some raw apple."

Like Hailey-Moss, more and more pet owners are thinking hard about what
they feed their companion animals: Some are cooking up homemade chicken,
brisket and lamb cutlets for a finicky Fido. Still others, concerned with
Kitty's "spiritual cleanliness," or perhaps their own, are buying kosher
cat food. And even more are turning their pets onto a vegetarian
lifestyle, creating a market that a growing number of companies are
springing up to fill.

FORT LAUDERDALE ? Four decades ago, hunters off the coast of Washington found 
a perfect young killer whale specimen swimming with its mother. They fired a 
harpoon, hoping to attach a buoy to the bigger animal that would make trailing 
them easier. But the spear went in deep and the mother whale drowned. 
The crew made a deal for the young whale with SeaWorld. The company today 
says it did not know about the capture. But it did calculate correctly that 
crowds would come to its San Diego park for the chance to see a killer whale, 
eventually named Shamu, up close. 
The modern marine park industry began with the death of Shamu's mother. Since 
then, the splashing stars have delighted millions. In the United States 
alone, more than 50 million people visit marine attractions, spending more than $1 
billion a year. That entertainment has come at a continuing price to animals. 
The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, in a nine-month investigation, examined the 
history and records of the industry, including more than 30 years' worth of 
federal documents on 7,121 marine animals the government collected but never 
analyzed. The newspaper found: 
? More than 3,850 sea lions, seals, dolphins and whales have died under human 
care, many of them young. Of nearly 3,000 whose ages could be determined, a 
quarter died before they reached 1 and half by age 7. Eighty three percent of 
bottlenose dolphins that died never reached 20, which is the industry's 
projection of their life expectancy for Flipper's species.

The term "downed" needs to be better defined when it comes to cattle, says 
Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont. 
In the midst of the "mad cow" controversy last December, the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture banned the slaughter of downer cattle, animals unable to stand 
on their own. 
Sick cattle should not be allowed in the human food supply, but the rule 
shouldn't apply to animals unable to stand due to other physical ailments, such as 
having a broken leg, said Rehberg. 
Rehberg introduced legislation last month that would allow cattle "downed" 
due to a list of physical conditions, such as broken limbs or temporary 
paralysis after calving, to be slaughtered and processed for human consumption. 
H.R. 4121, being sent to the House Agriculture Committee, is backed by the 
Montana Stockgrowers Association. 
"We would not support any action that would allow unhealthy animals into the 
food chain," said Steve Pilcher, executive vice president of the Montana 
Stockgrowers Association. "What this does is better define exactly those animals 
that might pose a human health risk." 
Under Rehberg's proposals, cattle that show signs of a central nervous 
disorder can not be slaughtered for human consumption. That includes bovine that 
stagger or downers with no identifiable physical problems.

  It is hard to give the exact number of animals that are killed throughout the world each year but it is estimated that it is about 45 billion.  That means about 5,137,000
  animals are killed every hour throughout the world.  It takes slightly over one hour to equal the numbers of innocent Jews that were killed in the Jewish Holocaust.  Would you believe that there has been about 2,600,000,000,000 animals killed in the world since the end of WWII?  The 2.6 trillion animals killed for food and experimentation since WWII is an educated guess.  That is a little less then a half million times as many Jews that were killed in the Jewish Holocaust.  The word "holocaust" can apply to both the animal holocaust and the Jewish Holocaust and does not take away from the Jewish Holocaust.  The comparison is valid since both get rounded up and placed into cages (concentration camps).  They both are tortured and sometimes starved in the case of laying hens. They are both eventually slaughtered.

  If we look at just the USA then we find an estimated 9.5 billion animals killed each year.  That is 1,084,000 animals killed ever hour or about 18,067 animals killed every
  minute.  With 301 animals killed every second, that is about one and a half time as many people killed on the train in Spain by terrorist in the beginning of March. Then we say that we do not want to upset our flesh eating friends by trying to convert them.  I think that we should do anything ethical to stop the killing of animals for food and experimentation.

Beijing authorities' decision to suspend local regulations on animal
welfare has aroused public debate from home and abroad.

According to a draft released by the Beijing municipal government on its
web site earlier this month, rules for the treatment and welfare for
animals being transported and facing slaughter were to be prescribed for
the first time in the country's history.

But the law was withdrawn on Wednesday, just four days later, without any
explanation. Sources within the city's Legal Affairs Office said the draft
had already been debunked as impractical by experts, and there are no
other plans for animal welfare legislation within the next five years.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), a non-governmental
organization, said it was sorry to hear about the decision.

"More than 100 countries including some developing countries in Africa
have adopted laws against abusing animals, but China has not," an IFAW
statement said.

RALEIGH, N.C. - A person holding a pigeon shoot in North Carolina
would be guilty of a misdemeanor based on bills filed Tuesday at the
General Assembly. They attempt to clarify the law in the wake of a court
fight.

The state Court of Appeals ruled in February that state law is not clear
about whether pigeons are protected as domestic animals and if the state's
animal cruelty statute applied to any animals that were not domesticated.

Identical measures introduced by Rep. Bill Culpepper, D-Chowan, and Sen.
Fletcher Hartsell, R-Cabarrus, would make it a Class 1 misdemeanor if a
person "instigates, promotes, conducts" a pigeon shoot or uses property
the person owns to release pigeons for the purpose of shooting them. The
punishment is up to 120 days in jail and a fine.

The court ruling stemmed from a fight by Granville County farmer John
Malloy to hold a semiannual pigeon shoot, which typically resulted in
between 25,000 and 40,00 pigeons being shot during the four-day event.

DE KALB, Ill. - The cement-floor holding rooms and massive freezers are
nearly ready for the horses, two years after fire destroyed the only horse
slaughtering plant in Illinois and one of only three in the nation to
process the meat for human consumption.

This month, Cavel International Inc. expects its rebuilt plant on the
outskirts of DeKalb to begin moving as many as 100 horses a day to
slaughter and then to European butcher shops. But whether the plant's new
floors ever echo the clatter of hooves could depend on Illinois lawmakers.

The business has gotten caught up in the emotionally charged question of
whether horses should ever go from the paddock to the plate.

"If in their culture they eat the meat, let them get it from France," said
state Sen. John Cullerton, who plans as early as Wednesday to begin
pushing through a bill to outlaw the slaughter of horses in Illinois for
human consumption.

Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, proposed the ban after learning
Belgium-based Cavel planned to restart its DeKalb operations, the only
U.S. plant outside Texas to slaughter horses for human food.

BOSTON -- Carrie Sherlock was outside her Uxbridge home with her
3-year-old son when he asked to be held. As she bent to pick him up, two
neighborhood Rottweilers came from behind her and snatched the boy from
her grasp. Three construction workers heard her screams, beat the dogs
with hammers and saved the boy.

Though courts have repeatedly labeled the dogs vicious and ordered them
destroyed, they are still alive, Sherlock testified Tuesday, because the
owner has continued to make appeals and move the dogs in the three years
since the attack.

That wouldn't be possible under legislation that would force cities and
towns to take custody of dangerous dogs until appeals are exhausted, then
force owners to pay the costs if the dog is ultimately condemned.

"I don't think these types of dogs should have the right to be held in
their owner's hands," said Sherlock, who appeared with her husband and
son, Matthew, before a legislative committee considering more than a dozen
dog-related bills. Matthew, now 6, suffered minor injuries.

Sponsors of the legislation say the state's dog laws are badly in need of
an overhaul.

One bill, sponsored by Rep. Bradford Hill, R-Ipswich, would more clearly
define what is a dangerous dog - not by breed, but by behavior. Hill said
this would give more guidance to local communities in fashioning their own
dog ordinances.

The federal indictment unveiled yesterday against Stop Huntingdon Animal
Cruelty is only part of a larger assault federal authorities have
launched against alleged animal rights extremists and others behind what
the FBI dubbed "special interest terrorism."

"The FBI has made the prevention and investigation of animal rights
extremists (and) eco-terrorism ... a domestic terrorism investigative
priority," said John E. Lewis, a deputy assistant FBI director in
counterterrorism. 
...
Lewis named SHAC along with the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth
Liberation Front in describing the tactics.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, however, questioned
yesterday whether legitimate activism was under attack.

"Some of the names being bandied about in this instance are longtime
activists and well respected," said PETA spokeswoman Lisa Lange,
referring to the SHAC indictment. 
...
"It has gone beyond mere activism and protests," said David Martosko,
research director for the Center for Consumer Freedom, a nonprofit group
supporting the food industry and animal researchers.
...
The center joined representatives from Kentucky Fried Chicken in
asserting before the Senate committee that PETA supports violent tactics,
a claim PETA denies.

Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir government has formulated a multi crore project 
to construct modern slaughter houses in various parts of the state to ensure 
scientific handling of animal products.

Work for constructing a modern slaughter house near Pantha Chowk in Srinagar 
would be taken up during the current year, Agriculture minister Abdul Aziz 
Zargar said while addressing a two-day national level conference on current 
animal disease scenario, food safety and public health. 

Speaking on the occasion, Housing and Urban Development Minister Ghulam 
Hassan Mir highlighted the multifaceted role of the agriculture sector in 
socio-economic transformation of the society.

He said this sector has tremendous employment-generation potential and called 
upon the concerned officers to demonstrate a collective approach to develop a 
forward-looking prosperous society.

Mr Mir said that government would explore all possibilities to associate 
veterinary doctors in the market inspection system to check quality of mutton and 
poultry.

Mr Zargar said a monitoring committee would be constituted to ensure the 
implementation of recommendations of the conference with a view to improve animal 
care and public health hygiene.

Mr Zargar assured veterinary doctors that all anomalies in service matters 
would be removed and added that the demand for grants for higher studies would 
be examined at the earliest.

Battery Cage protests planned at supermarkets 
Animal rights activists have begun a new phase in the campaign to ban the 
battery cage. The Campaign Against Factory Farming is asking Wellington 
supermarkets not to stock eggs produced on battery farms. 
CAFF has written to every supermarket in the Wellington area, asking them to 
stop selling cruelly produced battery eggs, and activists plan to personally 
visit every supermarket in Wellington over the next few months 
On Saturday June 5th, CAFF supporters will be protesting outside New World 
Supermarket in Wakefield St. 
CAFF spokesperson Arthur Price said most New Zealanders agree that battery 
cages should be banned, but the government had failed to act. "2.8 million New 
Zealand hens continue to suffer in appalling conditions. An opinion poll showed 
78% of New Zealanders are opposed to battery cage cruelty and want the 
battery cage abolished. We want supermarkets to respond to public demand and refuse 
to stock cruelly produced products". 
"We are demanding that supermarkets immediately stop selling eggs from 
Mainland Poultry which is New Zealands biggest battery egg producer. We also want 
supermarkets to stop confusing customers with misleading labelling such as "Farm 
Fresh" and instead use labels stating "Battery Cage Eggs".

ANIMAL-RIGHTS activists went to the home of a Chiron Corp. employee one
night last year to send a message. They pounded on her front door, rang
her doorbell, and shouted, "open the door, followed by an epithet.
Another night, they shouted through bullhorns then bragged about it on
the Internet. Someone also exploded two pipe bombs in her workplace.

Her crime? She was a paralegal for the Emeryville company, which engages
in animal research to develop vaccines and other life-saving products.
It
was her bad luck that Chiron had contracted with the animal-research
firm
Huntingdon Life Sciences -- and worse luck that animal-rights activists
had formed a group committed to putting Huntingdon out of business. A
group that was willing to intimidate any individual toward that end.

Last week, the feds indicted seven members of the group Stop Huntingdon
Animal Cruelty -- including three Pinole residents -- for stalking,
harassing and intimidating employees at Huntingdon, Chiron and other
concerns. The courts will decide if these individuals are guilty as
charged. A SHAC spokesperson told The Chronicle the charges are
"completely unfounded," then said this is "a classic First Amendment
case."

Diane at Pet Protection down on highway 93 north of Kingman AZ. 
Licensed for 50 dogs. The largest rescue in entire county which spans
the entire grand canyon on both sides.  Usually has 250 or more tied up
to fence posts, 6 large dogs in a 10X10 cage for weeks on end.  Never
try to stop any fights. Never lets them out for exercise. Diane doesn't
live there, but 30 miles away.  Every caretaker I've ever met there was
so drunk or drugged up I couldn't even carry on a conversation with
them. They loose 2-3 dogs a week on the freeway out front.  In 20
months have had two fires destroying the caretakers home the second
time.  First fire killed 16 dogs. Second fire killed caretaker and two
small children and more dogs.  Both fires caused by meth labs.  Many
dogs die of disease or thirst with no shelter or can't reach food and
water bowls.  In my three visits, I've never seen the various
caretakers remotely sober or able to converse.  Doubt that alcohol is a
major problem, but am not sure what all is involved.
 
When entering the front gate, you see dead kittens laying by the gate -
nobody bothers to clean them up.  Now, they have some pigs running
around the yard and along the highway with no containment at all.  When
I went to offer some suggestions, the three workers there were sitting
out front drinking beer and playing cards and yelled at me to get out
of there.  'IF YOU WANT TO HELP US, GIVE US $5,000 OR GET THE HELL OFF
THE PROPERTY!!"
Kingman County offices or animal control is not online or even
computerized.  
I found a computer for them and got a corp. to donated their ISP but
nobody has ever called the donors to confirm or approve.  Over a year
now.  supervisor Lane Plunkett is nice man with head up butt and does
little to see improvements.   Real blame here goes to the city managers
and city council who do as most other cities by reducing the AC budget
each year as they also witness but ignore the problems increasing
drastically.  The city council thought I was being too outspoken by
asking them to pay $350 for the  upgrade to the computer world. I
reminded them I had found it as a DONATION then they complained it
wasn't in their budget or ''approved '' county equipment.  I reminded
them before being escorted out of the court room that the 35% pay
increase they voted for themselves was also not in their budget - what
a surprise.

Prions, the misfolded proteins that are widely believed to cause
brain-wasting diseases, have been found in sheep muscle, scientists
announced yesterday - the first time they have been discovered in animal
flesh that many humans normally eat.

But the scientists emphasized that the finding did not mean that lamb or
mutton posed a danger to humans. 
...
The prions were found at one five-thousandth the concentrations that are
found in sheep brains, and therefore likely to be much less infectious.

Also, the animals were infected with scrapie, a prion disease that is not
the same as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Although
the symptoms of scrapie have been described in sheep for centuries, and
scientists believe that mutated scrapie prions may have caused the British
epidemic of mad cow disease of the 1980's, no case of scrapie transmitted
to humans has ever been found. 
...
He ventured a prediction: "Within the next year, somebody will make a big
splash by finding it in the muscles of cattle," he said, "and the beef
industry will go crazy."

Nonetheless, he said it was still his instinct that beefsteak had not been
the culprit in transmitting mad cow disease from cattle to humans in Europe.

"Mechanically recovered" meat, which is squeezed off chopped-up bones
under pressure, a process that in many cases mixes in spinal cord and
nerve tissue, was a "much better vehicle," he said. Late last year, spinal
cord and nerve tissue from cows over 30 months old was banned from human food.

Alfredo Kuba stands in the kitchen of his Mountain View, CA home, stirring
a spatula through a potful of lentils and tofu. Mussi, his sleek tabby
cat, watches expectantly from his kitty bed, eagerly flicking his tail to
and fro. Kuba spoons the stew into a bowl ? and sets it on the floor. It's
Mussi's dinner. "It took him a little while to get used to this, but now
he loves it," says Kuba. "For a special treat, I give him a little tofurkey."

Mussi eats this way everyday, and he's not alone in his peculiar tastes.
Some cats will dig through trash only for the empy tuna cans, but others
will lust for spinach, steal cantaloupe ? even slurp spaghetti. Mussi is a
vegan cat, part of a growing group of cats whose owners, vegans
themselves, have decided to wean their cats off their "natural" food and
put them on a plant-based diet. With the proper supplements, these
cat-owners claim, a cat can live a healthy, normal, even happy life eating
vegetables. 
...
Vegan Cats?

The mainstream has yet to embrace the idea of vegan cat food. "I don't
know about that stuff," says one Berkeley pet store employee when I asked
about vegan cat food, "Some places have vegan dog food, but I don't know
about that either. Dogs evolved from wolves and I can't imagine a wolf
that would prefer a salad to a moose."

But despite conventional wisdom, some dogs do prefer the salad. As any dog
owner knows, dogs love to munch down on meat, vegetables, old pizza crusts
and just about anything else they might find in the trash. Most experts
agree that dogs are omnivores that can thrive without meat; vegan dog
foods can even be found in some mainstream grocery stores.

But cats are a different story. Unlike dogs, cats are obligate carnivores
? meaning that in the wild they would eat nothing but meat. Dogs can enjoy
a meatless diet because they can synthesize some necessary nutrients that
cats need to get from their food. Those essential nutrients ? including
taurine, arachidonic acid, and vitamin A ? abound in meat. Cats go blind
and deaf without taurine. Without arachidonic acid, they suffer from
reproductive problems. And a vitamin A deficiency will stunt their growth
and bone formation.

Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich is realistic about the
chances of winning his party's nomination - nil - but he's confident he
still has the power to influence the party platform, he told enthusiastic
supporters in Missoula on Monday.
...
The Ohio representative and former Cleveland mayor drew loud cheers for
his plans to stop the war in Iraq, repeal the Patriot Act, get out of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, and develop a national, single-payer,
nonprofit health insurance program.

It's his hope, he said, that a strong showing in the final primary
elections of the year - including Montana's on June 8 - will send
delegates bearing his message to the Democratic National Convention in
Boston in July. Montana delegates have 21 of 4,322 total votes at the
convention.
...
The first question from the audience was about something a bit more
mundane, however: "Do you fish?"

Kucinich, a vegan, laughed and answered, "No. . . . I'm fishing for votes
right now."

ASCOTTISH businessman is found dead, slumped over the wheel of a rented
car near the city of Little Rock in the United States, surrounded by a
pool of vomit. Half-a-mile away an electrician stumbles upon a wooden box
abandoned beside the highway - containing four of the deadliest snakes in
the world...

It sounds like the opening to a Quentin Tarantino film. 
...
The trade in selling wild animals and plants is worth billions. Most of
that trade is legal, with dealers such as Exotic Reptiles Jungle
advertising a range of venomous snakes for less than ?100 each, including
comparatively less dangerous snakes such as pythons and rattlesnakes.

But, according to the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic
International, a "significant portion" of it is not.

And with collectors prepared to pay "tens of thousands of pounds" for a
single deadly snake, and poverty-stricken locals in countries where the
creatures are native, such as Africa and India, desperate to make a
living, it is not hard to see why the trade is estimated to be second only
to illegal drugs trafficking in terms of profit.

I got a call from Aaron Jackson last week. He's down in Los Angeles and
just wanted to let me know the FBI and local police have been harassing
animal rights activists again ? trailing them, arresting some on minor
charges (such as not wearing a seat belt). That kind of thing.

I'd met Jackson a few months earlier here in Toronto. At 24, the
fair-haired, clean-cut California native looks and acts like a poster boy
for George Bush's America.

In reality, however, Jackson and those like him are Bush's nightmare.
They're America's home-grown dissidents. They can't be dismissed as part
of some vague and undefined foreign threat because they are so obviously
not foreign.
...
Jackson belongs to a group called Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, or
SHAC-USA. It's aimed at a firm called Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract
research organization that, among other things, does laboratory tests on
animals for drug companies and agro-business.

Huntingdon says it does perfectly legal scientific work for "research into
human illness and well-being." Its critics say that it tortures animals,
pointing to a series of gruesome videotapes from the 1990s that document
what went on in some of Huntingdon's British labs.

In the United Kingdom, the animal rights campaign against Huntingdon was
so successful that the company faltered financially. Its saviour arrived
in the form of a U.S. firm called Life Sciences Research Inc. that took
over Huntingdon more than two years ago.

But as Huntingdon extended across the Atlantic, so did its tormentors.
Which is how SHAC-USA got set up in Princeton, N.J. just a few miles from
Huntingdon's main American lab.
...
In the U.S., authorities have used provisions of the so-called Patriot
Act, enacted after Sept. 11 2001, to target animal rights organizations.
In particular, the act allows grand juries (secret bodies charged with
deciding whether criminal charges should be laid) to share information
with one another. At last count, there were an unprecedented eight grand
jury investigations across the U.S. looking into animal rights
organizations as well as four aimed directly at SHAC.

Please join us for a discussion with inspiring activist and educator
Pattrice Le-Muire Jones.  On today's program we'll be addressing some
difficult challenges currently facing the animal liberation movement. 
For example, how do we make sense of the lack of diversity within the
movement? What does coalition-building actually mean and what does it 
look like in practice?  We'll also be tackling some interesting ideas,
including connections between queer issues and animal issues, and
relationships between animal liberation and the Iraq prisoner abuse
scandal. Pattrice will also share with us her experience of running a
chicken santuary, in the historical heart of the poultry industry.

Pattrice's bio:

At the Eastern Shore Sanctuary and Education Center, pattrice jones 
cares for chickens while promoting agriculture reform in a rural region
dominated by the poultry industry. Jones also coordinates the Global
Hunger Alliance, which unites animal, environmental, and social justice
organizations to promote plant-based solutions to the worldwide hunger 
and water crises. She has spoken up for animals in venues as diverse as the World Food Summit in Rome, the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, and the Sustainable Development Conference in Islamabad. An activist since 15, when she gave up meat and joined the gay liberation movement, Jones has organized organized rent strikes, kiss-ins, street theatre, and extremely unlikely coalitions. A founding member of Global Boycott for Peace, Jones agitates for direct economic action against war in the same spirit that she advocates veganism.

On March 2nd, California state Senator Rico Oller lost
a competitive, three-way Republican primary for the
U.S. House seat for the 3rd Congressional district
that sweeps from the suburbs of Sacramento through the
Sierras and to the border of Nevada.  With a late
surge, former Attorney General Dan Lungren edged out
Oller by about 2,500 votes.  There were several
decisive factors in the race, but one of them surely
was Oller&#x2019;s appalling record on animal welfare issues
and a concerted campaign by animal protection
advocates to short-circuit his run for the House.

During his eight years in the state legislature, Oller
had opposed some 20 animal protection bills, including
measures to strengthen laws against dogfighting and
cockfighting, to provide elemental care standards for
dogs on puppy mills, and to require that antifreeze
contain a bittering agent to prevent accidental
poisoning of pets and children.  In addition, Oller is
himself an enthusiastic bear hunter, specializing in
hunting with hounds.  A typical hound hunter chases a
bear with a pack of radio-collared dogs and drives the
bear into a tree, shooting the animal at point-blank
range &#x2013; a practice that even most hunters find
loathsome. 

Humane USA, the national political action arm of the
humane movement, mounted an independent expenditure
campaign against Oller that made use of mailings,
radio advertisements, and the dozens of volunteers who
went door-to-door in the district.  Polling work done
by humane organizations had revealed that most voters
&#x2013; regardless of party &#x2013; find animal fighting,
high-tech hound hunting of bears, the mistreatment of
dogs on puppy mills, and other forms of animal abuse
to be repugnant.  In the end, the independent
expenditure campaign -- combined with a complementary
effort by the Republican Mainstreet Partnership that
focused on other aspects of Oller&#x2019;s background --
acquainted voters in the district with Oller&#x2019;s record
and caused them to look to other candidates.

Since its founding in 1999, Humane USA has singled out
a number of candidates who have exhibited deplorable
records on animal protection.  A notable target was
Georgia&#x2019;s outspoken U.S. Representative Bob Barr (R). 
Barr had been among just three dozen or so legislators
who had voted against legislation pushed principally
by Republican lawmakers to ban the commercial sale of
videos depicting illegal acts of animal cruelty,
including so-called &#x201c;animal crush&#x201d; videos, in which
women in high-heeled shoes stomp small animals to
death for the sexual gratification of viewers.  Humane
USA made an issue of this vote in his 2002 race
against veteran Rep. John Linder (R-GA), and helped
cement the view that Barr, like Oller, was too extreme
and did not deserve to serve in public office.

Quick, does Matthew Scully sound like a Republican? 
He wants increased government regulations of
corporations that mass-produce animals for slaughter.
He is against "free-market" techniques of
conservation, in which some animals are killed or
captured in order to raise money to protect others. He
wants the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the
Safari Club, a powerful hunting advocacy group. 
Scully may sound like a liberal, but he is a
conservative with impeccable credentials: He works in
the White House as a speechwriter for President Bush. 
He has also emerged as a potent voice for animal
welfare in what is widely regarded as a red-meat White
House. Groups fighting animal cruelty consider him a
powerful advocate, and Scully is helping to advance
their issues. 
"He has had a substantial positive impact," said Wayne
Pacelle, the chief executive-designate of the Humane
Society of the United States, who credited the White
House for being open to Scully's views. "I don't say
this lightly: He's a hero to animal advocates across
the country." 
Much of that reputation rests on Scully's 2002 book,
"Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals,
and the Call to Mercy." In it, Scully denounced
Norwegian and Japanese whale hunters, industrial
farming techniques and the hunting of trophy animals. 
Although animal welfare is usually thought of as a
liberal cause, Scully argues that it ought to be a
central issue for religious conservatives. 
"Religious people . . . hold a kind and merciful view
of life, the faith of the broken, the hounded, the
hopeless," he wrote. "Yet too often, they will not
extend that spirit to our fellow creatures. More than
anything else, I hope with this book to speak to those
people." 
In interviews, Scully, 45, said animal welfare is a
nonpartisan issue. Everyone, he said, can agree it is
wrong to inflict needless cruelty on animals for
profit and to use wildlife and farm animals as
"resources" no different from wood and steel. 
Such cruelties exist because ordinary people ignore
where the meat they eat comes from, Scully said.
People who love animals such as dolphins and elephants
are uninterested in the lives of chickens and hogs.
But people -- Scully calls them "moral actors" -- can
alter the workings of the free market by making
choices about what kind of meat they buy, or whether
they eat meat at all. 
"It's caprice to say my dog is deserving of my care
and that dog in the shelter can be disposed of,"
Scully said in an interview at his office in the
Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where his
computer's wallpaper is a picture of a dog bounding
down steps. The dog is Lucky, Scully's boyhood pet, to
whom his book is dedicated. 
Scully, a vegetarian for 30 years, talked about
individual responsibility when discussing a hog farm
he saw in North Carolina where pigs spend entire lives
in narrow crates. 
"Pigs and lambs and cows and chickens are not pieces
of machinery, no matter how cost-efficient it may be
to treat them as such," he wrote in his book.
"Machinery doesn't cry or feel frightened or lonely.
And when a man treats them this way, he might as well
be a machine himself." 
Smithfield Foods, whose farm Scully wrote about, said
in a statement that the company complies with all laws
and houses animals in "an environment consistent with
their physiological needs."

Federal agents monitored activities from the parking lot while local
undercover officers loitered among the activists inside the campus
buildings. Vivisection laboratories readied themselves against incursions
as hardcore bands rehearsed for a benefit concert. One activist was
arrested shortly after delivering a stirring speech. The others --
possible "domestic terrorists" one and all -- were photographed entering
and leaving the event. Two other conference participants were arrested in
subsequent weeks.

The occasion for these dramatic happenings was not a building takeover,
banner drop, Black Bloc maneuver, or act of eco-sabotage. Federal, state,
and private security forces converged to police not actions but ideas at
the Student Animal Rights Organization (SARO) conference on animal
liberation, which included the first ever academic symposium on the
Animal Liberation Front (ALF).
...
Activists who undertake open or covert, legal or illegal investigations
or rescues often must struggle with the emotional consequences of
witnessing extreme suffering and may be haunted by the animals they were
unable to save. But, for those animals who are saved, open rescue
literally means everything. Conference participants were also able to
witness that aspect of open rescue, by means of a very different
videotape -- an Animal Planet episode that featured the rehabilitation
and release to a sanctuary of former foie gras factory inmates.

Time and again videotaped evidence collected by covert methods has been
the decisive factor in campaigns against cruelty to animals. Giving the
history of the SHAC (Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty) campaign, which has
eaten deeply into the profits of one of the worst vivisection operations
in the world and which seems likely to succeed in forcing the company out
of business, Kevin Jonas cited three key instances in which women went
undercover with hidden cameras and succeeded in bringing out footage of
extreme neglect and mistreatment. Those films have been used to motivate
activists, sway public opinion, and embarrass the company's customers
into cutting their ties with Huntington.

PHOENIX -- They used to gather in a cavernous hotel ballroom, tables
packed with bankers and shopkeepers rubbing elbows with politicians.
Those were the days when downtown Phoenix was booming, and the Downtown
Lions Club boomed right along with it. 
...
When ordinary citizens are not engaged in civic life, a democratic
society becomes unbalanced. The minority that speaks out is heard; the
majority that doesn't is ignored. For example, older Americans tend to be
more outspoken than younger Americans.
...
And then there's Heather Herman. At 15, the Denver high school freshman
is making her first foray into civic life by pushing a measure that would
ban wild animals in city shows such as circuses or carnivals.

Working with her parents, friends and animal rights activists, Heather
spent last summer going door-to-door and staking out supermarkets to
collect more than 6,000 signatures to get the proposal on Denver's Aug.
10 ballot.

"I was like: `I'm so young, could this really make a difference?"' she
says.

Her answer: "If you believe in it you have the power to do it."

Friday, May 28,Annapolis (Md.) Middle School students plant bay grasses, which young striped bass and crabs use as a haven and which are a food source for other animals. Almost a third of the underwater grasses in Chesapeake Bay died during 2003, unable to survive as pollution blotted out their sunlight, a report says.E-mail this articlePrint this articleSearch archiveMost e-mailed articlesRelated storiesAsian oyster: Pearl or peril for ecosystem?MANOR TOWNSHIP, Pa. &#x2014; The sailboat harbors and crabbing grounds of the Chesapeake Bay are miles from this shallow stream that runs through fields reeking of manure. 
But the problems of the west branch of Little Conestoga Creek in Lancaster County become the bay's problems, sooner or later. 
The animal waste that washes into the water here contains pollutants that eventually are carried into the Susquehanna River and then into the bay, where they feed blooms of harmful algae. 
"It's all based on a very sophisticated scientific principle: Water runs downhill," said William Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. "The Chesapeake Bay is downhill from Pennsylvania." 
The Keystone State does not have an inch of Chesapeake waterfront. But it is a major source of the bay's pollution, because Pennsylvania includes so much of the watershed for the Susquehanna, a massive river that provides half the bay's fresh water. 
A partner in the bay-cleanup effort since 1983, Pennsylvania dumps more nitrogen into the bay than Maryland or Virginia, which border the estuary, and has made far less progress than those states in reducing the flow of nitrogen and phosphorus, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said. 
In particular, environmental groups have said, Pennsylvania does little to monitor how small farms spread manure on their fields and allow it to run off into tributaries leading to the bay. Lancaster County, home to 336,000 cows and some Amish farmers who use only manure for fertilizer, has become the epicenter of the state's water pollution. 
So without changes in Pennsylvania, especially in Lancaster, the movement to save the Chesapeake cannot succeed, environmentalists have said. 
Last month, the state's voters approved a $250 million bond issue to improve sewer and water systems that contribute to bay pollution. And state regulators have proposed new rules to control phosphorus in runoff from farms. 
Pennsylvania officials also submitted to the EPA a strategy for cleaning the state's rivers. The strategy included plans to increase forest land and to plant "cover crops" &#x2014; which hold down soil in farmland during the winter. 
The EPA estimated that Pennsylvania contributes 39 percent of the pollutant nitrogen that flows annually into the bay. Pennsylvania also sends down large amounts of phosphorus, another key pollutant that &#x2014; like nitrogen &#x2014; is found in fertilizer. 
Even so, the EPA said Pennsylvania is only 23 percent of the way to its goals, compared with Maryland's 57 percent and Virginia's 35 percent. Pennsylvania also trails Maryland and Virginia in terms of progress on phosphorus. 
Once in the bay, nitrogen and phosphorus are food for large algae blooms, which block sunlight needed by underwater plants and consume large amounts of oxygen. The result is water in which fish can't live and crabs leap into the air to avoid suffocation. 
Although Pennsylvania acted in the early 1990s to monitor the pollutants coming from its large farms, environmentalists have said the other states now do more. 
Maryland has the most elaborate monitoring system, with farmers required to present a fertilizer-use plan to the state. The General Assembly also has addressed the other major source of pollution in the bay: wastewater-treatment plants. Last month, lawmakers in Annapolis approved a sewer surcharge that will provide a steady flow of revenue to improve the treatment of wastewater, something without parallel in Pennsylvania or Virginia. 
Pennsylvania officials contend the EPA's estimates haven't accounted for some of the progress the state has made in cleaning up the Susquehanna. 
Environmentalists working in the state said Pennsylvania has a strong agricultural lobby and that no watermen's groups would reap the bounty of oysters, crabs and rockfish in a cleaned-up bay. In addition, the state's main centers of population &#x2014; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia &#x2014; are outside the bay's watershed. 
Lancaster County contains the watershed for the Conestoga River, which is one of the most polluted in the Chesapeake watershed. In the county, progress has been uneven. 
The county's concentrated dairy- and beef-cattle operations are producing more manure than its crops can absorb as fertilizer, but there is nowhere else to put the waste, activists have said, so on the field it goes. The county's many Amish farmers present a particular problem because they do not use commercial fertilizer, Lancaster officials have said. 
The result of the animal-waste runoff is evident in the west branch of the Little Conestoga, a tributary of the Conestoga River. In a brown, cloudy creek like this one, the muck on the stream bottom can smell like sewage. 
Such groups as the Little Conestoga Watershed Alliance have worked with farmers to use fences to keep cows out of streams, create a buffer zone of undergrowth near streams and decrease the spreading of manure. 
But many farmers, not wanting to yield a competitive advantage, are not easily convinced. 
"You're barely making it as it is," said Earl Newcomer, a retired Lancaster County farmer who has worked with conservation groups. "If you change it, it might get worse." 
Another problem is when farmland is replaced by dense housing or shopping malls, environmentalists have said. Acres of concrete prevent rainwater from soaking into the soil and spread pollution from water and mud runoff. 
Those who have worked on the problem here in Lancaster said their job is tougher because the problem is so diffuse: It's not a single factory belching technicolor ooze. 
"You don't have any real major problem," in Lancaster, just a thousand smaller problems such as farms, houses and shopping malls, said Mark Metzler, a scientist who has studied the Little Conestoga. "But when you put them all together, you get a good-sized mess," he said. 
As Pennsylvania's efforts to deal with pollution continue, the state faces a deadline. For decades, much of the sediment washed out of Pennsylvania has not actually flowed into the Chesapeake &#x2014; instead, it has piled up as silt behind the Susquehanna's dams: Safe Harbor and Holtwood in Pennsylvania and Conowingo in northern Maryland. 
All the dams but the giant Conowingo are full, said Robert Walter, a research associate at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster. By 2020, he said, the Conowingo, too, is expected to hit its limit, and all of Pennsylvania's runoff will be spilling into the bay. 
"When that last dam is filled," Walter said, "that's going to be a catastrophic release."

PARIS - Gendarmes in eastern France have dismantled an elaborate poaching network which has been preying on a protected species and much-prized delicacy: the frog. 
Seven people have been arrested, accused of conspiring to evade French laws establishing quotas and closed seasons for the catching of pool frogs and edible frogs, whose legs have been a staple of French cuisine for centuries. 
A restaurateur in the Haute-Saone area of Franche-Comte, near the Swiss border, is also said to be facing possible legal action for buying contraband grenouilles de pays, or local frogs. 
Gendarmes and wildlife protection officials say this is the first time that an entire poaching network - from the frog-catchers to the processors and traders to the restaurateurs - has been dismantled in this way. 
The small, green and sometimes reddish frogs whose legs can be eaten have become relatively rare in France, but are still abundant in some areas. More than 90 per cent of the market is now supplied by frogs imported from Eastern Europe. 
Gourmets insist, however, that these do not have the true flavour of the domestic French frog, which can fetch up to 0.25 (16p) a time. 
One night's illegal frog fishing can net up to 1,000 frogs - worth 250 on the black market. 
French wildlife protection laws allow wild pool frogs and edible frogs to be caught for personal use only, in the frog-hunting season between May and September. Frogs are also farmed under strictly enforced quotas. 
Beating this system has now become an elaborate industry, said Didier Ory, head of the enforcement brigade for the French fisheries protection service in the Haute-Saone. 
"Frogs are being poached in their thousands, threatening not just their survival, but the whole ecosystem." 
French frogs are regarded as "richer in taste" than Eastern European frogs, said Michel Couturier, a fish and frog farmer in Burgundy. 
"When producers cannot meet demand, restaurateurs deal with poachers," he said. 
Some restaurants do not advertise frogs' legs on their menus but serve them only to aficionados, who know which eateries will secretly sell the illegal frogs' legs.

This year's Liberation carnival committee has backed away from its plan to 
offer nightly cockfighting at the carnival after Gov. Felix Camacho strongly 
opposed it. 



Gov. Felix Camacho's opposition has ended plans to offer cockfighting as a 
nightly feature at this year's Liberation carnival. 
Camacho is firmly opposed to cockfighting at this year's carnival, said the 
governor's spokesman, Shawn Gumataotao. 
Liberation Day Organizational Committee Chairman Tony Lamorena had said 
Tuesday that cockfighting and betting would be allowed in a closed-off area where 
only adults could enter. The carnival opens June 18 at Paseo in Hag?t?a. 
Lamorena acknowledged yesterday that the governor has the final say. 
"He does not approve of any heavy-duty gambling," Lamorena said.

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed with 
city zoo officials and animal rights activists that the two elephants remaining 
in local captivity should be moved to a sanctuary. 
So why are zoo officials and animal rights activists still at odds over the 
fate of the elephants? 
It seems it's a matter of timing. Zoo officials say they need to examine 
information submitted by two sanctuaries -- one in California and another in 
Tennessee -- and prepare the pachyderms for the move, which could take two to four 
months. 
But representatives of a group called In Defense of Animals say that's just a 
delaying tactic, and that the elephants should be moved immediately -- before 
zoo officials have a chance to bow down to opposition from the zoo's 
accrediting organization, which wants the animals sent to another one of its member 
facilities. 
Meanwhile, the supervisors -- without discussion -- on Tuesday came down on 
the activists' side and passed a nonbinding resolution urging the zoo to 
immediately bring in representatives from the Performing Animal Welfare Society, 
located in San Andreas, Calaveras County, and begin the transfer. 
The ballyhoo began after the deaths this spring of elephants Calle, 37, who 
suffered from degenerative joint disease, and Maybelle, who died of heart 
failure at age 43. According to zoo spokeswoman Nancy Chan, Maybelle was one of the 
three oldest elephants in captivity at the time of her demise.

Some calves kick. Some calves low. Some rear up on their hindquarters and try 
to escape. But when they meet the rabbi's blade, they all die the same. 
Spurred on by the electric prick of a cattle prod, each animal in turn bucks 
and heels its way along a dung-encrusted incline to Gateway Beef Cooperative's 
red-walled restraining pen. The calf's 1,200 pounds are maneuvered into 
position. The rear door shuts, and the pen's floor rises, lifting the calf off its 
hooves. A powerful harness then rumbles to life. Its coarse jaws clamp down on 
the calf's head, pulling it upward. The lowing stops. The calf's gaze is 
forced skyward, its neck exposed, a pulsing, docile arc. 
Raised on small farms throughout Missouri and Illinois, this calf and its 
brethren have been brought here to Granite City, Illinois, to be transformed into 
some of the best beef available in the United States. Gateway Beef, a small 
plant cooperatively owned by 58 ranchers and one kosher grocer in New York, 
deals exclusively in Angus cattle, a sort of aristocracy of the ruminant world. 
The plant specializes in top-quality beef, and a full 60 percent of its product 
is graded "prime" by the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- the highest grade 
the USDA awards.

The Royal New Zealand SPCA has hailed as a "step in the right direction" the 
sentence imposed on a woman who failed to look after 21 Persian cats found on 
her premises. 
Lynn Walker was yesterday sentenced by the New Plymouth District Court to 300 
hours Community Service and banned from owning cats for five years. She was 
also ordered to pay $4,000 in reparations to the SPCA. 
In passing sentence on Walker, Judge Louis Bidois said that she had "failed 
miserably to provide for these cats" 
Walker had earlier pleaded guilty to 41 charges, including 20 charges of 
failing to ensure the animals' needs were met in accordance with good practice and 
scientific knowledge, 20 of failing to ensure they received treatment that 
alleviated pain and distress and one charge of ill-treating an animal. Her 
guilty plea came on the fifth day of a jury trial, in which she had originally 
pleaded not-guilty. 
"We applaud the comparatively strong stance taken by the court over this 
issue. There have been far too many soft sentences in animal abuse cases. However, 
this sentence is definitely a step in the right direction. Hopefully, we will 
see a similarly tough response to other cases in the months and years ahead," 
says the Royal New Zealand SPCA's Acting Chief Executive, Jenny Prattley. 
The case revolved around 21 cats and kittens uplifted from Walker's property 
by the SPCA's North Taranaki branch in late 2000 and early 2001. Amongst the 
rescued animals were several suffering from snuffles, ringworm, gingivitis, 
conjunctivitis, fleas, chronic skin disease and/or severe fur-matting. One cat 
had not had its sutures removed for several months following an operation, 
whilst a kitten with a ruptured eye ulcer needed to be humanely euthanased.

Complaints about a television pictures showing turkeys suffering in a Bernard 
Matthews barn in Norfolk have been dismissed by the media watchdog. 

The company made its complaint after GMTV broadcast secretly-filmed footage 
in November 2002 describing a "disgraceful scene" in a fattening unit at Weston 
Longville, near Norwich. 

One turkey was shown with soiled plumage, another lying on its back and one 
with a broken leg.

But Ofcom, which regulates the communications industries, threw out all 
Bernard Matthews' complaints. It described the programme as "a legitimate 
investigation of conditions at the Bernard Matthews' barn".

David Joll, managing director of Bernard Matthews, said the company was 
surprised and disappointed by the findings.

He said that any injuries to the turkeys were caused by the programme makers 
themselves. 

He said: "Someone smashed the side of the shed and shone a light at the 
turkeys while they were asleep, panicking them." 

Mr Joll said that a Granada film of the same turkey shed only days later, 
conducted in the daytime with the company's permission, painted a very different 
picture, but that Ofcom ignored this.

"Before-and-after photos of saved horses fill albums in the home of Large 
Animal Protection Society President Joanne Mauger.

But some of the most compelling photos are of a recent victim, a malnourished 
Amish-owned horse found running loose with hooves in desperate need of 
attention and pieces of plowing harness still attached, rubbing deep sores along its 
body, slapping its bleeding flanks. A buggy horse, it was made to pull a plow 
meant for a much larger draft horse.

Mauger and Laps treasurer Pat Geiger said the group has seen it all, but the 
state of the horses they see always saddens them.

Laps is to horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cows what the Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is to dogs and cats. Laps was chartered by the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1988 as a non-profit humane agency.

Like the "animal cops" seen on the Animal Planet television network, Laps 
agents have badges and respond to complaints of abuse, abandonment and neglect. 
Agents educate, advise, investigate and, when necessary, issue citations, 
legally seize animals and make arrests. The agency enforces the cruelty laws and 
serves Chester, Delaware, Lancaster and Berks counties with a working board and 
an unpaid staff of volunteers.

It's a place where orphaned and abandoned cats roam free, sunning themselves 
in the windowsill and lounging on cat furniture until just the right adoptive 
family arrives to take them home. 
If you haven't visited Heartland Animal Rescue Team in Brainerd lately, the 
newly renovated cat room may surprise you. 
The rows of individual cat cages are gone, along with the multitude of litter 
boxes. Instead, for the past three months the cats and kittens now available 
for adoption in the animal shelter are allowed to freely roam the cat room, an 
open and sunny place filled with handmade cat furniture, a couch and a couple 
of discreetly placed litter boxes. Cat toys can be found throughout the room 
as the cats entertain themselves or snuggle up to visitors. 
The renovations reflect a change in philosophy at the animal shelter. 
Kennel manager Adriene Myears has been at HART for five months. She said she 
arrived at the shelter with several goals in mind. Included in those goals was 
to increase the rate of cat adoptions and help the adoptive cats become 
better equipped to deal with a home environment.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa ? Sanctuaries caring for orphaned African apes 
plan to release more of their charges back into the wild in a bid to save them 
from extinction, primate experts said Wednesday. 
"We are getting endless streams of incoming orphans.... We have to reverse 
this process and rebuild the wild populations," said Doug Cress, spokesman for 
the Pan African Sanctuaries Alliance (PASA).
He was speaking at a PASA conference in Johannesburg, which ended Wednesday 
with a commitment from delegates to undertake the tough task of reintroducing 
more orphaned chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos into the wild.
PASA groups 19 sanctuaries across Africa caring for more than 600 apes and 
other primates, but only three, in Congo and Gabon, have successfully attempted 
to release animals back into their natural habitats. Ten other sanctuaries in 
Uganda, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Congo said they would also now 
attempt to do so.
Time is running out for humanity's closest living relatives. A study unveiled 
at the conference Tuesday said the chimpanzee could be extinct in around 50 
years because it is hunted for meat and threatened by deforestation and disease.
Estimates of wild populations vary but point to some 200,000 to 300,000 great 
apes left in the world. Some, like the mountain gorillas, only number a few 
hundred.
Most of the orphans are victims of the bushmeat trade, their parents killed 
by poachers. The poachers are often caught when they try to sell the orphans as 
pets on the black market, and the animals are then taken to the sanctuaries.
Tough Task

Karen MacKenzie is temporarily homeless, but also determined to be reunited 
with more than 30 cats she surrendered to an animal shelter after leaving her 
mobile home in New Eagle. 
Washington Area Humane Society officer Susanne Lewis said she learned May 29 
that MacKenzie was keeping a large group of cats in her station wagon. 
In May, MacKenzie turned over eight felines living in her former residence at 
the Ave Belle Estates mobile home park in New Eagle, Lewis said. 
Lewis said five of the cats were pregnant
MacKenzie said she decided to leave the mobile home park after hearing rumors 
that some of the cats she turned over to the shelter were diagnosed with 
leukemia and that her mobile home was going to be quarantined because of reports 
related to the other cats in her residence. 
"The landlord gave us, supposedly, to the end of the month to be out," she 
said. 
MacKenzie said she and her husband loaded the back of their station wagon 
with about 30 cats and set off for a relative's house.

 The summer barbecue season is upon us. What better time to revisit the
 topic of mad cow disease? Before you plop that slab of Ol' Bossie on the
 grill, before you slather up that rack of beef ribs with Joe Bob's
 Country BBQ sauce, take a moment to think about what you will be eating.

Several months ago, this column went into some detail about the
possibility that mad cow disease (or BSE) may have already infected
America's food supply. Knappster took considerable grief from my
carnivorous friends who now regard me as a pinko, semi-vegetarian cow
sympathizer. A few of them growled and complained about their God-given
right to swallow chewy flank steak, to guzzle gristle, ravage ribs,
masticate bull testicles, to kill and eat anything with four or more
legs. They suspect that I raised the mad cow issue as part of a
surreptitious animal welfare campaign.

Admittedly, there are animal welfare issues involved. The things that are
done to docile cows in the name of hamburger are mind boggling and
revolting. However, the more pressing issue for humans is the health
question. Is the American beef supply reasonably safe and free of BSE?
Since my last article on this topic, several disturbing things have
happened.

Anyone remember Dave Louthan? He's the guy who discovered the first
American mad cow case back in December. A few weeks later, Louthan was
fired from his job at a Washington meat plant where he had worked for
four years.

The reason Dave was fired is because he dared to tell reporters
that--contrary to official pronouncements--the mad cow in question had
been ground up into hamburger and had already been eaten by consumers.
More chilling, he told people that the BSE-infected cow was not a
so-called downer cow, but, rather, had been up and walking around when it
was slaughtered. The reason this is so scary is that America's first line
of defense against BSE cattle is to weed out downer or disabled cows, to
keep them from becoming dinner. The USDA requires very little BSE
testing, so it is up to the meat packers to pick out the sick animals and
keep them out of the food chain.

The China Post

Consumers in Taiwan are advised to make careful examination when they 
purchase vegetarian products since as high as 70 percent of such food products are 
found to have animal ingredients. 
Lawmaker Chen Chien-ming of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the 
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said in a press conference 
yesterday that 15 of the 21 vegetarian products examined by the Department of Health 
(DOH) were found to contain animal ingredients such as pork, fish, fowl, and 
beef products. 
The samples were purchased from two markets on Hulin Street and Wushing 
Street in the Sungshan District of Taipei City in early March. 
Chen said that the DOH should carefully examine all products described as 
being vegetarian and should impose stiff fines on producers who add animal 
products to their merchandise. 
He noted that statistics provided by the DOH show that of the population aged 
19-44 in Taiwan, one out of every 10 define themselves as vegetarians, 
meaning that the vegetarian population is above 2 million on the island. 
According to the Food Health Management Law, if food producers supply 
counterfeit or alter products, they will be subject to fines of between NT$40,000 and 
NT$200,000. Those who falsely label their products will be subject to fines 
of up to NT$150,000. 
"To protect the rights of vegetarians in Taiwan, the DOH should impose 
stiffer fines," Chen urged. 
He also urged consumers to pay attention when buying vegetarian products. 
Buddhist nun Shi Chao Hui, a professor at Hsuan Chuang University, lamented 
that only two of 21 vendors in the probe could provide information about the 
origin of their products.

June 12,2004
It is important for consumers to acquire enough knowledge to make good, 
level-headed assessments of the risks various foods pose to their health without 
being misled by media reports. 
In the past few years, Japan has been hit by a series of food scares and 
food-safety scandals, including the outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
(BSE) and bird flu, revelations about large amounts of residual pesticides in 
vegetables imported from China and various food mislabeling scandals. 
These problems are all part of the evils of today's efficiency-oriented 
system for mass-producing and mass-consuming foods as if they were industrial 
goods. These episodes have naturally made Japanese consumers quite uneasy about the 
safety of foods they consume. 
But many consumers are surprisingly ignorant about food safety issues. 
When BSE makes headlines, they stop eating beef. When bird flu makes a splash 
on front pages, they avoid buying chicken and eggs. Consumers' response to 
such news, however, is mostly temporary, and they quickly forget the problems. 
Japanese consumers' concern is often directed only at matters reported in the 
media but not at real issues behind the news. 
No case of bird flu infection in humans from eating chicken or eggs has been 
reported in the world. 
Still, many people in Japan are currently feeling ill at ease about eating 
eggs or chicken. 
What these people should know is that chickens are grown in very poor 
conditions in many of today's chicken farms, often in crowded, windowless poultry 
houses. 
And some scientific studies have found that chickens that lay eggs under 
these stressful circumstances often have a disease in such organs as the larynx, 
the ovary, the liver and the air sac. It makes little sense to fret only about 
bird flu while turning a blind eye to this and other serious problems with 
chicken farming. 
BSE also represents only an extremely small health risk for Japanese 
consumers, who don't eat such dangerous parts as the brain or the eye. Moreover, 
unlike Britain, which started a serious effort to prevent the spread of the disease 
to humans only after more than 160,000 cows had become infected, Japan took 
steps to contain the disease immediately after the first case was discovered. 
Rather than worrying about BSE, Japanese consumers should be more concerned 
about the widespread use of synthetic hormones for growth promotion by American 
cattle growers as well as the abuse of antibiotics in the livestock industry, 
which is causing proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

My neighbor Mike is a 1,000-yard sharpshooter. He has offered his services on 
many occasions to ranchers whose property is overrun by prairie dogs. 
He sets up a platform on his pickup and blasts away 400-700 yards from the 
unsuspecting varmints. It is because the shooter, and therefore the noise, is so 
distant, that the other prairie dogs are not frightened into their holes. It 
allows the population to be reduced. 
He uses what is called a ballistic-tip bullet. It is designed to penetrate 
the skin and immediately expand inside the beast. Death is instantaneous and 
dramatic. The prairie dog explodes like a hand grenade. By professional standards 
it would fit the definition of a humane method of euthanasia: no nervous 
anticipation, no pain, no guilt. 
Which leads me to the wood chipper headline. 
During the recent exotic Newcastle disease outbreak in California, it was 
necessary to destroy hundreds of thousands of chickens, millions of fowl, 
jillions of potential nuggets. The affected birds could not be used for human 
consumption. Imagine if you will, the magnitude of the process and disposal problem.

Members of the extremist Earth Liberation Front, who once waged their war
to protect the environment by spiking trees and sabotaging logging
equipment, are moving out of the forests and into the streets.
...
Instead of simply protecting trees, the Earth Liberation Front, or ELF ??
made up of loose-knit, individual cells that follow a universal
philosophy of protecting the environment by hurting corporate budgets ??
has now taken to targeting building developers who log land or fill in
wetlands to make way for new homes, say federal officials.
...
Rod Coronado, a former spokesman for ELF and the similar Animal
Liberation Front (ALF), says the group's shift from forest to suburbia is
in keeping with its desire to financially hurt organizations and
individuals that profit from environmental destruction.

"There's a direct relation in the fact that environmental destruction in
one's own community ?? urban sprawl and poor air quality ?? are becoming
the largest issues," said Coronado, who spent four years in a federal
prison for a 1992 arson attributed to the ALF at Michigan State
University's experimental fur farm. 
...
A visit to either the ELF or ALF Web sites, run by press offices that
only act to disseminate information about attacks made by cells, sheds
light on the groups' aims and tactics.\

Security has been tightened on the BOC gas production site in Scunthorpe,
in the wake of protest threats from animal rights activitists.

The 32-acre site on Warren Road - said to be one of the biggest
production centres in Europe - is on a hit list drawn up by protest group
Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac). The Worcestershire-based Shac
campaign is planning a national march and rally in Guildford on June 26
to highlight BOC's alleged involvement with experiments at a top research
laboratory.

Shac spokeswoman Barbara Davis today not did rule out the prospect of
supporters staging a simultaneous protest in Scunthorpe on the same day.

BOC, which has traded in North Lincolnshire for 46 years, supplying gases
to the nearby Corus steelworks, declined to discuss security measures on
the Warren Road site.

But spokeswoman Helen Bray said: "People who are concerned about animal
rights issues have a legitimate right to protest and we support that
right."

She said the company, which has other sites in Grimsby and
Stallingborough, supplied gases to a wide range of businesses, including
Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS).

It is understood the makers of a much anticipated cat-specific toxin 
developed in Victoria are interested in trialling the toxin on King Island, although 
it was not clear whether the toxin was included in the initial program. 
Senator Murphy would not put a cost on the program. 
"It is not a cat eradication program, it is a control program that can evolve 
over time," he said. "The thing is, we have to start somewhere." 
He said Dr Kemp's office had been very supportive of the idea and he hoped an 
announcement was only a matter of weeks away. 
State Game Management Services Unit senior officer Graham Hall told the 
meeting -- held after the opening of the two-day pheasant season yesterday -- he 
had visited penguin rookeries on King Island only to find the remains of birds 
killed by feral cats. 
"You might see a wing here, a leg or something there, then you'll see feral 
cats, but not many penguins," Dr Hall said. 
"They are having a big impact." 
The King Island Game Bird Association has placed a three-year moritorium on 
breeding and releasing pheasants, which costs $30-$40 a bird, and put the money 
into feral cat control instead.

JACKSON, Miss. - When American troops unearthed Al Qaida bioterrorism manuals 
in Afghanistan caves a couple of years ago, U.S. veterinarians were suddenly 
pulled into the war on terrorism.
The documents explored how terrorists could infect American livestock and 
domesticated animals with bubonic plague, anthrax and tuberculosis. They showed 
how viruses could be distilled into powders and added to dirt where animals 
gather: horse shows, livestock auctions, county fairs.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture warned colleges that veterinarians would be the front line in 
detecting terrorist-engineered epidemics. Veterinary students must now learn to spot 
medieval terrors like bubonic plague - whether the symptoms erupt in pigs, 
cattle, horses, poultry, parrots, puppies or kittens.
There are 28 vet colleges in the United States and those that are located in 
Southern states - Alabama, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Mississippi, 
Arkansas_ all now offer bioterrorism programs, said Dr. Gary Beard, assistant dean 
of continuing studies at Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine.

POPLARVILLE - A Poplarville man was arrested on two charges relating to 
operating a "hog-dog" rodeo.

The Pearl River County Grand Jury indicted Frankie Wheat, 44, of 279 Mitchell 
Chapel Rd., with an animal cruelty felony charge and a related count of 
charging money for admission to the illegal events. 
The indictment, a violation of Mississippi Code Section 97-41-15, reads, 
"about the 10th day of April, 2004, (Wheat) did wilfully, maliciously, unlawfully 
and feloniously and out of the spirit of wanton cruelty, maim, wound, and 
injure livestock. . . "

Count two reads, ". . . did wilfully, unlawfully and knowingly own, manage 
and receive money for the admission of other persons to a place, 279 Mitchell 
Chapel Road, Poplarville, . . . , kept and used by him for the purposes of 
conducting 'hog-dog' rodeos where animals to-wit: hogs, were tormented and 
tortured. . ." 

A felony conviction for the animal cruelty charges could carry between 12 
months and five years in prison, full restitution, and fines of up to $10,000.

The indictment comes just after the People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals (PETA) released a document claiming that Pearl River County law enforcement 
agencies were ignoring the charges.

Leading members of the RSPCA are seeking to force the Queen to step down
as patron of the charity because of her support for hunting.

Militant members of the group last week claimed that the monarch was
"irrelevant" to the society, which has become vehemently anti-hunting.
They want to drop the "Royal" part of its name, granted by Queen Victoria
in 1840, and become known as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
...
The election has caused controversy because all six candidates are
members of many of the same animal rights groups, fuelling criticism that
the society's agenda has shifted from "animal welfare" to campaigning for
"animal rights".
...
Critics said that the candidates' manifestos confirm that the society has
been taken over by animal rights activists. One member close to the
ruling council said: "The RSPCA's main role is to care for cats and dogs
and other pets but it now has an agenda dedicated to political campaigns
for bans on hunting, whaling, experiments on animals and other animal
rights issues."

The manifestos show that half the candidates are members of the League
Against Cruel Sports and Compassion in World Farming, five belong to the
British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, and two are members of
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. All want foxhunting banned.

Lose weight, feel sensational and do absolutely no cooking? Bring it on,
says Joanna Bounds.

Forget the Atkins diet. Throw away your cabbage soup plan. There's a new
eating movement on the horizon. It's the raw food diet, and its
followers, like those of a cult religion, proclaim long life, boundless
energy and freedom from illness.

And, although not a weight-loss tool, following the raw food diet will
always mean a drop in kilograms - seeing as fruit and vegetables make up
most meals, along with seeds, nuts, pulses and some fermented foods such
as olives. Which may be another reason for its popularity.
...
Like all eating fads, the raw food diet has celebrity followers. American
fashion designer Donna Karan says eating raw food has boosted her health
and energy levels and helped her lose 10 kilograms.

And many Australians are following Karan's lead - there are now raw food
groups all over the country. Rene Beresford founded the Fruitarian Raw
Food Network in Queensland more than 12 years ago.
...
So does being a raw foodist mean no more meals out, and an end to all
those satisfying takeaways?

"It is not as difficult as you'd think. Often I just order a salad when I
eat out," says Beresford. "Personally I do not go to restaurants, but in
the case of a very special occasion, I can always order a vegetarian
meal, even though some cooking may have taken place. It's not an everyday
thing and so what if once in a while you have a minor indulgence."

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Shivering monkeys huddle on a bare cement floor 
behind rusty bars. Elephants, whose tusks provided the name for this war-divided 
nation, struggle in thick mud. 
A safety grating covering the alligator pond is peeling back, opening a gap 
that looks wide enough for the beasts' wide jaws to pass through. 
"Imagine what could happen to a child" who got too near, says Ayekoe Yapo, 
director of the crumbling Abidjan Zoo. 
Since civil war broke out in September 2002, conditions at the zoo, one of 
West Africa's largest, have mirrored the slide of this once cocoa-rich nation 
into chaos and poverty. 
Before the fighting largely ended a year ago, more than 3,000 people were 
killed and at least a million driven from their homes. At the Abidjan Zoo, 
one-third of the animals died during the war and the rest fared little better. 
Schoolchildren once flocked to the zoo, gaping at the apes, snakes and other 
wildlife that are dwindling in the African wilderness. Few can now afford a 
trip to the zoo, which is all but empty during the week, Yapo says. Only about 
100 visitors come on the weekend -- barely enough to cover the ticket-taker's 
salary, he says.

ST. MARKS - The manatee surfacing in the Wakulla River revealed a scarred 
tail with a rounded end that looked like a cookie with a bite missing.
"You see the propeller scar? That just breaks my heart," Wakulla County 
Sheriff's Deputy Annie White said.
She is one of several deputies who patrol the river to enforce a Wakulla 
County slow-speed zone. The HuManatee Inc. group pays about $1,600 a month for 
gasoline, boat maintenance and deputies to patrol on weekends.
The speed zone, from just south of the U.S. Highway 98 bridge to Wakulla 
Springs State Park, wasn't put in place specifically to protect manatees. It 
protects other boaters and swimmers from accidents and protects the shoreline from 
damaging waves.
The Big Bend area has no manatee speed zones. Even so, White said, the 
lumbering sea cows on the Wakulla River are protected when boats slow down.
Putting actual state manatee speed zones in place in Northwest Florida could 
become more difficult, environmentalists say, if Gov. Jeb Bush signs a bill 
amending manatee-protection laws that was adopted by the Legislature.
Supporters of the bill, including boating groups, say manatee speed zones 
still will be allowed under the bill. The bill also would require the Florida 
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to maximize boating opportunities in 
addition to protecting manatees. Supporters say the two should be balanced. 
Manatee-protection groups say the bill's language would open manatee regulations 
to legal challenges.

The chance to watch a prowling wolf or meet the gaze of pale lupine eyes 
across brushy tundra makes Denali National Park one of the most extraordinary 
places in the world to view wildlife. 
But how people should deal with individual wolves that seem fearless has 
generated a growl of disagreement among park officials, scientists and other 
people familiar with the closely studied animals that den along the Toklat River. 
The issue is the latest wrangle over what may be the most famous wolves in 
North America -- about 100 animals that inspire intense emotions as well as 
thousands of stories, studies and photographs. 
In this instance, it's about visitors, dogs and a "keep wildlife wild" 
program put in place after close encounters in 2000 and 2001 worried park officials 
that a few wolves had gotten too bold. 
A long-standing policy that allows dogs on leashes in certain campgrounds and 
roads, combined with new advice that people shout, bang pots or even strike 
wolves that deliberately come too close, is putting both wolves and people at 
risk, according to a wildlife scientist who studies Denali wolves. 
Telling people to drive off wolves with rocks or sticks misunderstands the 
natural fearlessness of Denali wolves, Gordon Haber, a frequent critic of 
federal and state wolf management, said in a letter last month to Denali 
superintendent Paul Anderson.

SELF-IMPRESSED protesters who wanted to "shut down" the BIO 2004
conference in San Francisco last week could take a lesson in morality and
courage from Emeryville's Chiron Corp. The protesters engaged in their
cheap stunts knowing there would be no real consequences for their
actions -- not in San Francisco. Chiron employees, on the other hand,
endured personal abuse and vicious harassment for months because they
believe their work to develop new medicines and therapies is too
important to abandon.

The harassment began in 2003, when animal-rights activists began
targeting Chiron because it had contracted with the animal-research firm,
Huntingdon Life Sciences. The campaign -- which included yelling
obscenities in front of workers' homes, following workers' children and
jamming employees' home phone lines -- is the handiwork of Stop
Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, an animal-rights group dedicated to shutting
down Huntingdon for using animals in research.

SHAC's specialty, which has evolved into harassing and intimidating
companies that do business with Huntingdon, is called "tertiary
targeting."

        <docText>A lonely killer whale on Canada's 
Pacific coast, whose search for companionship has become a danger to boats and 
float planes, and himself, will be captured next week so he can be reunited with 
his family pod, officials said on Thursday. 
Scientist said it was clear the one-ton whale, nicknamed Luna, would not be 
able to link up with the pod on his own, so he will have to be trucked to the 
southern tip of Vancouver Island where the other orcas normally spend the 
summer. 
Luna has been swimming alone in a bay on western Vancouver Island since 2001, 
but as human activity in the area picked with the approach of summer, he was 
having run-ins with boats and float planes in an apparent search for 
companionship. 
Luna nearly collided with a landing float plane two days ago, an accident 
that could have killed both the whale and the people on the plane, officials 
said. 
"For Luna's sake, we have to move now," said John Nightingale, director of 
the Vancouver Aquarium. 
Orcas, or killer whales, normally spend their entire lives with other members 
of their pod. Scientists do not know if Luna, whose official designation is 
L98, became lost or was kicked out of the family unit. 
Canada and the United States agreed late last year to move Luna, but had to 
wait until L-pod returned to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where it spends the 
summer swimming in both U.S. and Canadian waters.

Eleven elephants, caught by a wildlife trader and destined for zoos in China, 
will soon be returned to their natural habitat. 
Thanks to swift action by the Sabah Government, the Bornean elephants will be 
released at various locations in the State next month.

The animals had been trapped because they were said to be damaging farmers? 
crops, by a known wildlife trader last year, but international organisations 
questioned the motive for the animals? capture.

Local and international conservationists were also enraged when the trader 
was granted an export permit to send the elephants to foreign zoos.

Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora 
and Fauna (Cites), trading in elephants for commercial purposes is prohibited.

This then led to the intervention of the State Government which announced 
that the elephants would be released into the wild instead of being exported.

"The Sabah Government is to be commended for halting the export of the 
elephants for what seems to be questionable purposes," said Chris R. Shepherd, 
regional programme officer with TRAFFIC South-East Asia, the wildlife trade 
monitoring network.

Prior to their release, the elephants will be radio-collared for close 
monitoring.

Data from the reintroduction of these animals into the wild will benefit 
other elephant conservation projects in Asia.

Elephant-human conflict situations arise when humans encroach into elephant 
habitats, affecting their territory and food sources.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has given the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries a much-needed reminder to take the threat to
research from animal rights extremists more seriously. The FBI is right
to say that companies are failing to face up to what has emerged during
the past two or three years as the biggest domestic terror threat in the
US. Its comments apply as much to Europe as to the US.

Companies that use animals in research or testing, directly or
indirectly - which means the entire pharmaceutical industry and most of
biotech - generally refuse to speak out about the issue for fear of
inciting extremist attacks. Individual companies think, understandably
but wrongly, that they can leave it to their trade associations to take
the undoubted risks of making public declarations.

There are honourable exceptions, most obviously the UK-based Huntingdon
Life Sciences. It struggles on, despite being the prime target of
activists, who have tried to shut down HLS not only by direct action but
also by harassing its clients, suppliers and anyone with a business
relationship to it.

Earth Liberation Front Frustrates Law Enforcement With Increasingly
Destructive Campaign
...
LOS ANGELES -- Fire ripped through luxury homes under construction in
Washington state. Molotov cocktails ignited sports-utility vehicles in
Virginia. Graffiti coated a dozen SUVs in Santa Fe, N.M. All in the name
of Mother Earth -- and all apparently the work of a shadowy
environmental group known as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF).
...
The loosely organized underground movement is continuing to frustrate
law enforcement officials across the country. Only a few arrests have
been made in the past five years, and there have been even fewer
convictions. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in rewards have been
offered by authorities, and additional FBI agents have been assigned to
investigations involving the group.

Unlike traditional criminal enterprises such as the mob or biker gangs
with rigid hierarchies that have been successfully infiltrated by
undercover agents, there is no formal club for officials to break into.

Federal investigators and prosecutors have expressed frustration at the
difficulties of cracking down on multi-state campaigns of low-level
crimes, intimidation and property damage because of a lack of applicable
federal laws.

A Hudson, Wis., man has been charged with stabbing his former girlfriend's 
two cats to death in a jealous rage and leaving one on the bed in her Rosemount 
home.
The Dakota County attorney charged Joseph Donald Leier with felony burglary 
and animal cruelty Tuesday in the November 2003 slayings. It's the third time 
the Dakota County attorney has filed charges of felony animal cruelty since 
legislators created the felony statute in 2001, according to the prosecutor's 
office.
Leier, 29, is accused of breaking into the Rosemount home of his 
ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Berquist, on Nov. 17, 2003, and stabbing her two cats in the 
throats with a kitchen knife.
According to the complaint, a roommate returned home to discover Anika the 
cat with a kitchen knife still embedded in its throat on Berquist's bed. The 
roommate called police and Berquist, who was with friends.
"I got a phone call from my roommate, and she was hysterical. She said Anika 
was dead," Berquist said. "I just prayed that Ginger, my other cat, was OK and 
that she'd hidden and gotten away. I got the bad news an hour later that she 
didn't. I was pretty devastated."
Rosemount police later found the second cat's body in Berquist's walk-in 
closet. The roommate's dog was unharmed.
Leier, who is not in police custody, declined to comment Thursday. But 
according to the complaint, Leier denied killing the cats to police, although 
officers observed catlike scratches on his arms. Leier also said he wasn't in 
Minnesota the night of the incident, but police traced Leier's cell-phone records, 
which show he made phone calls that were routed through towers in Rosemount.
Berquist, 33, said she first met Leier at a bar two years ago. Berquist said 
the relationship turned sour a year later when they began arguing frequently. 
She described the situation as "mentally abusive."

According to Ringling's latest ad campaign, "All our newborns come with a
lifetime guarantee." The Ringling ad goes on to claim that its
captive-breeding program is somehow helping endangered Asian elephants.
Ringling must believe that there is a sucker born every minute because
PETA has evidence that the ads are pure fantasy. Government documents
show that Ringling's elephants suffer abuse and die prematurely, that the
circus has been cited for more than 100 deficiencies in animal care, and
that most of its elephants were captured in the wild. PETA is calling on
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to yank the bogus ads.

False Claim #1: "All our newborns come with a lifetime guarantee."
Reality: Ringling forcibly removes still-nursing baby elephants from
their mothers, causing trauma, harm, and even death. This barbaric
practice has contributed to the deaths of two baby elephants and to the
painful injuries of two others.

?
Ringling paid $20,000 to settle U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
charges of failing to provide veterinary care to a dying baby elephant
named Kenny. Kenny was forced to perform despite obvious illness and was
found dead in his stall in a pool of bloody diarrhea.  ? Benjamin drowned
while trying to escape the pokes and prods of a handler chasing him with
a bullhook. Even though elephants are excellent swimmers, Benjamin had
never had the opportunity to learn how to swim from his mother.  ? When
taken from their mothers, Doc and Angelica suffered painful injuries as
they struggled in terror against ropes tightly binding their legs in a
futile attempt to rejoin their mothers. The ropes left raw wounds on
their legs.
Ringling trumpets the births of "15 bundles of joy" at its breeding
compound since 1992. In fact, four of the 15 births that Ringling is
taking credit for occurred at Busch Gardens, not Ringling's Elephant
Conservation Center, and belonged to an elephant trainer named Roman
Schmitt.

With almost a quarter of Britons who claim to be vegetarian admitting to
regularly eating red meat, are entirely meat-free diets on the wane?

One in five so-called vegetarians admitted eating poultry and over half
ate fish, research by the TNS Family Food Panel found on Tuesday.

The survey found just 42% of people who professed to be vegetarians
adhered to the traditional definition, eating no red meat, fish or
poultry.

British Dietetic Association spokesman Sue Baic said the "vegetarians"
eating some meat and fish were likely to be those who had chosen the diet
for health reasons.

"People following a vegetarian diet for ethical reasons, I doubt they
would include those foods," she said. 
...
Vegetarian Society chief executive Tina Fox said the TNS survey
highlighted a general increase in the number of people eating some meat
and fish as part an increasingly vegetarian diet - a portion of whom
would call themselves vegetarian.

Veggie future

"There has been a big rise in the number of 'meat reducers'. The
vegetarian food market continues to increase," she said.

"Food issues are much higher up the agenda and people are getting more
health-conscious. They are more concerned about their food, more
concerned about how things are reared. People are buying organic produce.
People are more concerned about what they put in their mouths."

TNS found 4% of Britons said they were vegetarians - a figure that has
remained static in recent years - but Ms Fox said she was optimistic
about Britain's "meat reducers".

        <docText>A national animal rights group has appealed to Valencia County's 
administration to remove chaining of dogs from its animal control ordinance. 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said in a press release Monday 
that it had written to County Manager Michael Trujillo and the county commission 
regarding the group's belief that chaining dogs deprives them of social 
interaction that they need and crave and drives them mad. 
The organization recommends that the county follow the lead of many other 
jurisdictions, including Bernalillo County, that have passed anti-chaining 
legislation. 
PETA plans to place a new billboard showing a chained dog next to a tagline 
saying "To Keep Your Family Safe, Chain Your Doors, Not Your Dogs," to alert 
Valencia County residents to the dangerous consequences for humans and dogs 
alike for keeping dogs chained. 
The group's action comes after a pit bull dog attacked and badly injured a 
5-year-old Los Chavez girl last week. 
"People who relegate man's best friend to a chain are planting ticking time 
bombs in their yards and risking their families' lives, said PETA Director 
Daphna Nachminovitch in the release. "Dogs are members of the family, not lawn 
ornaments or furry alarm systems." 
The organization said it maintains an extensive file on children who have 
been mauled and even killed after wandering into chained dogs' reach or 
encountering dogs who had broken free from chains.

The FBI says eco-terrorism -- acts of violence in protest of harm to
animals or to the environment -- is the United States' No. 1 terrorism
threat from inside its own borders.

In the early 1990s, biotech executives and scientists were inundated by
harassment and violence in the United Kingdom and Europe. In 1996, the
violence began spreading to the United States when demonstrators burned
a U.S. Forest Service truck in the Willamette National Forest in Oregon.
In August 2003, two pipe bombs exploded at Chiron, a pharmaceutical
company in Emeryville, California, followed by another explosion in
September 2003 at Shaklee, a health and beauty products company in
Pleasanton, California. 

The FBI has linked much of the harassment and violence to groups
including SHAC (Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty), the Animal Liberation
Front and the Earth Liberation Front. But the groups have largely evaded
authorities by operating in cells and using aliases.

The fate of a dog that mauled a 3-year-old boy last year will remain in limbo 
until September, when a court decides whether it will hear new testimony. 
The City of Toronto wants the dog to be put down, while the Toronto Humane 
Society is fighting the order and wants the dog kept alive. But outside court 
yesterday, a humane society worker called the dog "a loaded gun waiting to off." 
And in an odd twist, the city has subpoenaed seven new witnesses from the 
humane society to testify about the behaviour of the dog, a pit bull-Labrador 
cross. 
Yesterday, Justice of the Peace Patrick Deacon told lawyers for both sides 
that he wanted to reserve his decision to give him time to review case law on 
whether to hear from the new witnesses.

Seven animal rights activists pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges
that they promoted violence and vandalism against a research company
that tests chemicals on thousands of animals at a New Jersey lab each
year.

The 10-minute arraignment drew about 30 protesters to the federal
courthouse in Trenton, and prompted the U.S. Marshal's Office to
heighten security in and around the building. But the demonstration was
peaceful and the court proceeding ended without incident. 

The defendants, members of the group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty,
were indicted last month on charges of conspiring to commit animal
enterprise terrorism, an offense punishable by three years in prison.
Prosecutors contend the defendants encouraged and in some cases planned
attacks to intimidate the research company Huntingdon Life Sciences, its
clients or associates.

Huntingdon uses thousands of animals -- mainly rats, but also dogs and
monkeys -- to conduct product safety tests each year for its clients,
primarily pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers. The company is
based in London, but performs most of the tests at a laboratory in
Franklin Township, Somerset County.

ST. PAUL - An animal-rights group wants the city of St. Paul to purse
legal action against a circus company in the death of an acrobat who
died during a performance last month.

In a letter to City Attorney Manuel Cervantes, an executive for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals cites a state law dating to the
1800s that requires acrobats to perform with a safety net.

Lisa Wathne, PETA's captive exotic specialist, called on Cervantes to
investigate. The statute calls for a $250 fine if a safety net is not
provided. A violation is a gross misdemeanor.

Three Knoxville sisters made an upsetting discovery on Tuesday night at
their abandoned family farm off of Old Callahan Drive in North
Knoxville.

Someone has been using the sheds on the farm to keep a flock of
roosters, and according to animal welfare officials, there are strong
indications the fowl were used for the illegal sport of cock fighting.

"It was very upsetting, very. This is my momma and daddy's home," says
property owner Donna Smith.

Clues that the animals may have been used for fighting include missing
feathers and crowns. While no fighting devices -- like razor blades --
were found, some of the roosters' spurs have been trimmed - a hint that
blades could be attached for fighting.

Richard Kahn: Thank you Anthony for meeting with me today, and
congratulations on the release of your new controversial book examining
the history and future of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF)! Before we
go any further, I think everyone will want to know, are you yourself or
have you ever been a member of the ALF?

Anthony J. Nocella, II: The answer is no. I have never been and I never
plan to be a member of the ALF. I get asked this question all the time.
Oddly enough, in my work I study many extremist, revolutionary, and even
terrorists groups, and yet I never get fingered as being a member of
those organizations. Yet, because I have practiced as an animal rights
activist in the past, people tend to assume that I must be an ALF
spokesperson or cell member also. Of course, this is just a silly
mistake -- the animal advocacy movement should not be directly equated
with the animal rights movement, nor should the animal rights movement
be perceived as being the same as the Animal Liberation Front. There are
many differences, sometimes big differences...I'm simply interested in
analyzing those differences and in helping the public to achieve greater
clarity about militant politics such as practiced by the ALF. That does
not require my affiliation. Further, while we're on the record, let me
state that I have never conducted interviews with the so-called
"underground" either. The only people that I ever communicated with
during the entire process of putting Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?
together were above ground activists, as well as a few former ALF
members that have been convicted and are no longer active in the
underground.

Neighbors of Mayor James Hahn came to his defense, squirting water from
jumbo squirt guns on about a dozen animal rights activists who were
demonstrating last weekend in front of his San Pedro home.

The incident, prompting outrage on both sides, came as part of the
latest protests by members of the Animal Defense League over treatment
policies at city animal shelters.

"All we wanted to do was talk to him about the city's policies and who
he is going to appoint as general manager," ADL press officer Jerry
Vlasak said Tuesday. "We were demonstrating peacefully for about 20
minutes when some of his neighbors came out and got raucous.

Against all odds, Dennis Kucinich plans to make his presence felt
through next month?s Democratic National Convention and beyond
...
FOR A CANDIDATE who failed to win a single presidential primary, Dennis
Kucinich has an impressively healthy sense of his own importance. Last
month, Kucinich ? the only Democrat other than John Kerry still actively
running ? opened his Democratic National Convention headquarters in a
cramped fourth-floor office on Temple Place, just off Boston Common.
...
Kucinich is a small man with lank, unkempt hair and large ears; rather
than fitting the standard image of a presidential candidate, he looks
like a dour elf ? one whose manner is often brittle and who, for good
measure, just happens to be a vegan.

Still, Kucinich persevered. And though few pundits or voters ever saw
him as a serious contender, his doggedness earned the grudging respect
of some once-skeptical observers.

If Debra Poneman could give parents one word of advice about a newly
vegetarian kid - well, it would be two words, but both would be most
welcome.

"Stop worrying" said the Evanston mother of two and author of What? No
Meat? What to Do When Your Kid Becomes a Vegetarian (ECW Press, 2003).

Poneman remembers well her mother's reaction when she, then a
17-year-old Skokie girl, announced her decision to renounce meat. "Mom
said, without missing a beat, 'That's nice, but Daddy has some skirt
steaks on the grill, so why don't you wait and start tomorrow?' "

"Well, I started 'tomorrow,' and now it's been 35 years," Poneman said,
laughing, in a recent interview. And although her mother -- like many
parents -- feared for her vegetarian daughter's health, it soon became
apparent there was no need to worry.

Please don?t ask me why I am a vegetarian. Seriously, don?t ask. I will
give you the most obvious response: I don?t like meat. To that, you are
going to (quizzically) ask me ?why??

See, if I tell you it is for animal rights, then you are going to point
out my leather shoes and the fact that I am eating skittles (gelatin
i.e., horse hooves. Enjoy.) If I was a true vegetarian for animal
rights, you would say that I would be a vegan. And I know that if you
don?t understand vegetarianism, you really don?t understand veganism and
what it takes to get there. Hint: You do it in stages. It just ends in
an argument.
...
My guess is that they think I am an extreme left wing, tree-hugging
environmental activist that is trying to brain wash you to ?my side.?
Not that the profile is completely inaccurate, but for goodness sake,
why would I waste my time trying to ?brainwash? a person when I could
be, I don?t know, shopping or watching TV, both of which are more
productive.

I am not going to tell you why you shouldn?t eat meat, because you
really don?t care. And I am not going to tell you why I don?t,
because
you really don?t care. If it is something you are truly
interested in, you should say ?wow, tell me more about that!? If you
want to argue, be content knowing that I won?t change my mind, and we
can both save our breath.

The Australian Koala Foundation has written to the government urging it to 
declare the koala a vulnerable species after a survey of 1,000 koala habitats 
found 30 percent no longer had a koala in them and 60 percent had suffered 
widespread destruction. 
"I truly believe that in my lifetime the koala will become extinct unless we 
do something," Deborah Tabarat, executive director of the foundation, told 
Reuters. 
Koalas are protected by law but the eucalyptus trees they call home and which 
provide their only source of food are not. 
There are about 100,000 koalas in Australia, down from an estimated seven to 
10 million at the time of white settlement in 1788. In the 1920s three million 
koalas were shot for their fur.

A County Council committee began deliberating a new law this week that would 
repeal a pit bull prohibition put in place seven years ago and replace it with 
a broader law. 
Some council members and residents question the fiscal feasibility and the 
social costs of the new bill. 
Council Bill-29, called the Vicious Animal bill, would implement the 
recommendations submitted last year by the Vicious Animal Task Force. The legislation 
would repeal the breed-specific provisions pertaining to pit bull terriers and 
add more regulations to address perceived problems associated with all 
potentially dangerous dogs. 
At a Tuesday work session of the council's Health, Education, and Human 
Services Committee, council members questioned Prince George's Animal Control 
Manager Rodney Taylor about the effectiveness of the old pit bull legislation and 
the potential fiscal and social impact of the new broader legislation. They 
also heard testimony from residents for and against the new legislation. 
Pearline Chittams, a grandmother in Lanham, condemned the new law proposed by 
Councilman Thomas R. Hendershot (D-Dist. 3) of New Carrolton, saying it would 
make owning pit bulls legal again. 
"Gangs of young people will once again return to the streets with these dogs, 
thus making senior citizens prisoners in their own homes," Chittams 
testified. "This justification of returning pit bulls to the county would be laughable 
if children's safety was not at stake."

TALLAHASSEE - Scientists think red tide played a part in the deaths of 107 
bottlenose dolphins off the Florida Panhandle this year. 
The scientists are puzzled, however, by some aspects of the latest ``unusual 
mortality event'' of marine mammals. 
The interdisciplinary team, led by scientists from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, said Wednesday that it had analyzed the stomach 
contents of about half the dead dolphins and completed tissue tests on 28 of the 
dead mammals. 
Scientists found high levels of brevetoxins, which are produced by the red 
tide algae, Karenia brevis. 
Lesser levels of domoic acid, another toxin created by microscopic plants, 
were detected in the stomachs, urine and feces of some of the dolphins. 
Domoic acid has been associated with die-offs of California sea lions but 
never with mammal deaths in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The scientists eliminated infectious disease as a cause of death for the 
animals that were autopsied.

TALLAHASSEE - Scientists think red tide played a part in the deaths of 107 
bottlenose dolphins off the Florida Panhandle this year. 
The scientists are puzzled, however, by some aspects of the latest ``unusual 
mortality event'' of marine mammals. 
The interdisciplinary team, led by scientists from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, said Wednesday that it had analyzed the stomach 
contents of about half the dead dolphins and completed tissue tests on 28 of the 
dead mammals. 
Scientists found high levels of brevetoxins, which are produced by the red 
tide algae, Karenia brevis. 
Lesser levels of domoic acid, another toxin created by microscopic plants, 
were detected in the stomachs, urine and feces of some of the dolphins. 
Domoic acid has been associated with die-offs of California sea lions but 
never with mammal deaths in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The scientists eliminated infectious disease as a cause of death for the 
animals that were autopsied.

Alaska State Troopers arrived at a Soldotna musher's house last week to
find 15 dogs chained to their doghouses, no food or water in sight, ribs
showing through the layers of their husky fur.

Now, troopers' plans to give the dogs back to the owner have run into
opposition from the Alaska Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which has the animals and says they shouldn't go back to an
abusive situation.

According to trooper Capt. Tom Bowman, the huskies' owner, Sigmund
Stormo, had paid a distant relative $10 a day to take care of his dogs
while he was away at a remote site on Kodiak Island for work. The
relative, whom troopers would not name, apparently did not do his job.
The dogs may have gone without food or water for 10 days.

The Cole Bros. Circus is coming to Dodd Stadium this weekend. Lyndsay
Meiklem of Norwich is not going.

Meiklem objects to the circus' use of animals in its performances.

"In the year 2004, it's an extremely antiquated form of entertainment,"
she said. "I think it's a really cruel form of entertainment."

Meiklem, 29, is organizing a protest outside the event and will
distribute fliers with information about the issue.

She said circus animals live in artificial conditions and are forced to
suppress their natural instincts through abusive training tactics.

"How we treat animals is a very important issue," she said. "How we
treat them is a direct reflection of our own society."

OREGON CITY -- Sarah Christopherson charted the course that led to the
high school diploma she will receive this summer.
...
Fifteen months ago, Christopherson became a vegetarian then a vegan, who
eats no meat, eggs, cheese or any food that comes from animals.

For her, it was an act of conscience. She was repelled by factory
farming where animals may be caged all their lives.

"I just didn't like the process that (animals) went through,"
Christopherson said.

"I thought it was just a phase, but for her, she was choosing it as a
way of life," Eunice Christopherson said.

RHINEBECK - How much do you really know about how your food is produced? 

If you're like most people, probably very little. We purchase food from
our supermarkets prepackaged and ready to eat, often giving very little
thought to where it comes from and what went into making it. That is,
until an insider like Howard Lyman give us the "plain truth."

Lyman, also known as the "Mad Cowboy," will speak about his
transformation from a cattle rancher to a vegetarian animal crusader at
a presentation of the documentary film "Peaceable Kingdom" at Upstate
Films in Rhinebeck at 1 p.m. on June 19.
...
Sponsored by Catskill Animal Sanctuary, the event, which is free and
open to the public, is part of CAS's opening weekend. There will also be
an open house at the sanctuary, a 75 acre haven for abused farm animals
in Saugerties, on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
...
"When he tells you how things are, he knows first hand," said Roberta
Schiff, president of the Mid-Hudson Valley Vegetarian Society. "People
should come to learn the truth about factory farming and how food is
produced. It is a wonderful opportunity to have (Lyman) in Rhinebeck."

A wine and hors d'oeuvres reception sponsored by the Mid-Hudson Valley
Vegetarian Society will follow the film and presentation.

State Agriculture Commissioner Don Ament says his agency is accustomed to 
keeping an eye on cattle, horses and other farm animals.
But mean, nasty, just-plain-bad dogs?
That's something new. 
But it's what the state Agriculture Department will have to do beginning July 
1.
A bill signed into law by Gov. Bill Owens requires the department to keep a 
statewide dangerous-dog registry.
"This is really a different deal," Ament said. "I don't know of any other 
states that do this."
However, he said implanting identifying chips in pets and farm animals is an 
idea that's been growing nationwide. "If this keeps up, I wouldn't be 
surprised if we're going to be identifying everything that moves with a chip."
The new law requires that a microchip permanently identifying a dog as 
dangerous be implanted at the owner's expense following a conviction for owning a 
dangerous animal.
The veterinarian or licensed shelter that implants a microchip has 10 days to 
notify the Agriculture Department's Bureau of Animal Protection. Prior to the 
microchip being implanted, the dog owner must pay a $50 dangerous-dog 
microchip license fee to the bureau.
According to early estimates in the bill, of an estimated 5,600 dog bites 
annually in Colorado, 1,400 will be prosecuted and 467 will be required to pay 
the fee.

Areas on the outskirts of forest land have been witness to over 10 panther 
attacks in five months. 

But we have a bit of a dilemma here ? who do we really blame ? the panther 
that decides to come searching for prey in an urban set up or people, who have 
infiltrated into its space and are disturbing it?s habitat.

Animal activists have one voice on this issue. Bhavin Gathani, of Karuna 
Parivar says that human encroachers are to be blamed for the increasing panther 
attacks.

?These encroachers are both tribal and urbanites. The tribal population that 
has been living in forests for generations is steadily increasing. Moreover, 
they cultivate land, fell trees and hunt. This has disturbed the habitat of 
these animals,? he says.

?But builders who are slowly encroaching into forest land are the real threat,
? he adds.

Shakuntula Majumdar from the Thane Chapter of Society for Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) agrees. 

She says, ?We are the real encroachers, and we are spoiling the forest 
habitat. The growing number of societies near Yeoor Hills is not a good sign and it 
will only steadily increase. In fact a number of complexes share their 
compound with the forest.?

Projects such as Vasant Vihar, Hill Crest, Lok Puram, Garden Estate and Happy 
Valley have come up at the foothills of Yeoor forest only in the last 10 
years but these complexes are well within the city planning limits and so are not 
illegal. 

However, residents say they have had to call on forest officials to capture 
panthers that have strayed for prey. 

Explaining why most people buy flats in this area, Mukesh Patel of Neelkanth 
group says, ?People find flats in these areas reasonable and builders also 
provide reasonably good amenities.?

The forest department agrees with activists, but blames the town-planning 
department for the growing urbanisation near the forest.

Every time I drive by a McDonald's I glance up and see its proud slogan
-- "Billions and billions served." But I was not one of them.

The reason: I am a strict vegetarian and there was little on the menu I
could touch. Yeah, I could have ordered a McDonald's salad, but it's a
bit like going to a steak house and ordering the shrimp.

That's why I was excited to learn McDonald's had -- with little fanfare
-- recently added a veggie burger to its roundly carnivorous menu.
McDonald's was reaching out to me. Or so I thought. 
...
After I ordered, I grabbed the manager, Hilario, and peppered him with
questions: "Was my McVeggie cooked with meat and/or chicken products?" I
asked.

A bemused smile curled on his lips and he replied: "No, it was not
cooked with any meat products." I queried him again just to make sure.
He nodded slowly as if I was crazy. 
...
At $2.99 it's an unbeatable value, but I couldn't help feeling cheated
by the sort-of-McVeggie. McDonald's, you can do better. Let's just say
I'm not lovin' it.

WAUCHULA - Out in the woods, the new morning ambles through the oaks and
pines, fluttering sunlight over the creek, pestering jaybirds into
raucous gargle and wooing the creature from his dreams with fresh fruit,
herbal tea and the old, sweet promise: You are safe here.
...
This center, with its spacious habitats and almost 2,000 feet of
elevated chutes which extend the animals' range and choice, is one of
nine nonprofit great-ape sanctuaries in North America and the only one
dedicated to orangutans. It is not a breeding facility. It is not a zoo.
Although scientists, animal-care experts, students and supporters often
visit, it is not open to the public, and when a convertible full of
smiling, sunburned tourists pulls into the driveway, Ragan apologizes
but firmly turns the sightseers away.

''This project is not about being hands-on with the apes,'' she says.
``. . . It's about them learning to live with their own species, to
provide for them, as much as we can in a captive situation, a more
natural life.''

''She's probably the top of the heap just because of the quality of
care,'' says April Truitt, director of Primate Rescue Center, a
monkey/chimp center in Nicholasville, Ky. In fact, almost any human
wandering around here for the first time -- poking into the kitchen as
lunch is scooped into big bowls or hearing caregiver Ray Rooney call
''All right, Roger. I'll be right there,'' to a chimp literally
screaming for attention -- may succumb to an entirely peculiar notion: I
wish I were Radcliffe.

CNN.comThe U.S. House of Representatives Thursday rejected 
an attempt to ban snowmobiles from Yellowstone National Park, which critics say 
cause pollution and disturb wildlife.
The House voted 224-198 against the ban, originally pushed by the Clinton 
administration. The Bush administration decided to allow the machines to stay in 
the park, most of which is in Wyoming.
"If there's something not natural in a national park, it's snowmobiles," said 
Rep. Sam Farr, a California Democrat who supported barring the vehicles.
Opponents of the ban said concerns about the impact on the park's environment 
and wildlife could be addressed by requiring the use of cleaner, quieter 
snowmobiles and limiting the number allowed in daily.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Critics of the Sacramento County Animal Shelter,
which has been under scrutiny for years, say that two studies in the
last four years have produced the same results. And now, they're calling
for a full audit of the facility.

The shelter takes in 22,000 animals each year. Some animal activists say
the animals aren't being taken care of properly.

"We believe the public has a right to know how taxpayer money has been
spent," said animal activist Dia Goode.

At a press conference Thursday, animal activists said that officials
have known for years about problems at the shelter, and that they're
dragging their feet when it comes to making changes.

student energy, many of the environmental movement?s leaders and

to find out. Sarah Clement of Marysville just graduated after studying
the environment and participating in the Bailey Scholars program. Mike
Belligan of St. Johns got his bachelor?s degree in resource development
and geography a year ago and is now pursuing a master?s in geographic
information systems. Kristin Konath of St. Clair also just graduated

JOHANNESBURG ? South Africa is catching an increasing number of Japanese in 
illegal possession of endangered plants and animals which fetch high prices in 
Japan.
At Cape Town airport, crowded with weekend tourists on May 14, a Japanese man 
set off a metal detector alarm because of something he was carrying and was 
subjected to a body check.
Inspectors found 37 small live lizards in paper packets concealed in the 
man's jacket.
The animals were armadillo lizards which live in dry areas in the state of 
Western Cape, southern South Africa. When it senses danger, the animal makes 
itself round by holding the tip of its tail for defense, like an armadillo.
The number of living armadillo lizards, which grow to about 20 centimeters 
long, is estimated at only 2,000 to 3,000, and it is illegal to take them out of 
the country.
The Washington Convention regulating deals in endangered plants and animals 
designates the lizard as a species facing extinction and forbids international 
trade in it.
The Japanese man and two other Japanese with him were taken into custody. One 
of them, a 38-year-old man from Osaka Prefecture, was also arrested in March 
for allegedly trying to bring 52 lizards out of South Africa.
In April, the man was fined 110,000 rand (about 2 million yen) and left South 
Africa, but he returned to smuggle lizards again.

Shark-hit Shell swims 4000 miles
By Cara Page

A TOUGH turtle swam 4000 miles to Scotland despite having one of her flippers 
bitten off by a shark.
The lost loggerhead, nicknamed Shell, was left floundering in circles in the 
Caribbean Sea after the shark attack reduced her to three flippers.
Experts believe she managed to slip into the Gulf Stream but was swept into 
the chilly Atlantic, leaving her weak, exhausted and nearly dead.
She was washed up4000miles from home on a beach in North Uist in the Outer 
Hebrides where she was found by a couple of tourists out for a walk.

MOTHERS who feel run off their feet can take a leaf from the fighting fish 
childcare manual.
Father knows best in the world of fighting fish, where the female's job is 
just to mate, lay eggs and swim off to resume her independent life.
It is up to the male to take care of the brood, either building bubble nests 
for the eggs and babies, or keeping them safe in his mouth.
Overturning conventional wisdom, researchers here have come up with new 
findings that reveal why male fighting fish care for their young the way they do, 
which has made the cover of the journal Evolution.
By recreating the fish's evolution through DNA analysis, they found that very 
similar species of fighting fish could have different childcare habits, 
depending on their evolutionary history and where they lived.
One of the researchers involved was Associate Professor Peter Ng of the 
National University of Singapore's (NUS') Department of Biological Sciences, who is 
also director of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research.
'We now believe that these extremely adaptable fish have evolved different 
forms of care, and this is dictated by the niche habitats and conditions where 
they live,' he said.
For about 20 years, scientists have argued the fundamental question of which 
came first: bubble nests or mouth brooding.
Some believed bubble nests came first - where the male takes the eggs and 
places them in a nest made of bubbles at the water's surface - followed by the 
mouth brooder, which takes care of the eggs and fry in its mouth, starving the 
entire time.
Other scientists thought that the breeding patterns depended on where the 
fish lived - stagnant water made it easier to build bubble nests, while 
fast-flowing streams called for mouth brooding.

A KANGAROO stopped traffic yesterday when he wandered off the beaten track 
and into a Port Macquarie shop.

The big male Eastern grey was discovered in the store room at ColorTile at 
lunchtime yesterday.

Employee Janette Collins said she didn't believe it when two tourists 
wandering past stopped to ask if she knew about the roo.

"I thought they were joking and said 'yeah that happens all the time'.

"Then I looked over and there it was," she said.

"We had to stop deliveries for about two hours because we didn't want it to 
get out and be hurt in traffic."

But then staff faced the dilemma of how to move the animal.

The RSPCA was called, then WIRES and finally the National Parks and Wildlife 
Service.

MADISON, Wis. -- A 19-year-old Salt Lake City man is on a mission to try
to shut down eight primate research centers across the country,
including the one operating in Madison.

Jeremy Beckham is traveling across the nation trying to educate the
public about the cruelty of primate research. Beckham claims when
primates live in steel cages all of their lives, it causes them to harm
themselves. But researchers disagree, saying there is no maltreatment of
these primates.

Experts at the UW Primate Center in Madison say when people see images
of cruelty to animals it's important to understand the context of the
situation.

A cat has been rescued from a building site in Newquay where it was trapped 
under the concrete floor of a partially constructed building. 
The RSPCA was called on Wednesday when visiting Health and Safety inspectors 
heard the cat mewing. 
It is not clear how long the cat had been trapped, but the animal charity 
says he is quite thin and dehydrated. 
Charles Gilby, from the Health and Safety Executive, said the concrete floor 
was laid two months ago. 
 He's probably used up more than one of his nine lives 

Felicity Cross, RSPCA Officer 
Inspectors from the executive have been carrying out construction site visits 
across the county in a bid to reduce the number of fatal and serious injuries 
in the industry.

ST. PAULS, N.C. -- The 34 pit bulls seized from a Robeson County man
accused of animal cruelty won't be euthanized unless a judge orders it,
authorities said Friday.

Katherine Floyd, the county's animal cruelty investigator, said she
would like to personally handle the adoption of the dogs, which are
being held at the Robeson County shelter in St. Pauls.

Nothing will happen with the dogs, however, until the case is handled in
district court, Floyd said.

Paul Laurent, 36, was charged Thursday with 34 counts of misdemeanor
animal cruelty after authorities raided his Rowland home on Tuesday and
Wednesday.

In 1979, Howard Lyman underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his spine
and came out a changed man.

Convinced the growth was caused by the tons of industrial chemicals he
had used on his vast cattle ranch, the self-described ''Donald Trump of
agriculture'' became a food safety and animal rights activist.

Lyman, author of ''Mad Cowboy: Plain Truth From The Cattle Rancher Who
Won't Eat Meat,'' will take his cause to Rhinebeck Saturday, following a
screening of Jenny Stein's ''Peaceable Kingdom'' at Upstate Films. The
2004 documentary, which features Lyman, is about the interconnected
lives of farmers, farm animals and animal rescuers, and is set against
the backdrop of agribusiness.

''It's not about becoming a vegetarian -- it's about becoming
conscious,'' said Kathy Stevens, director of the Catskill Animal
Sanctuary, a 75-acre home for abused and neglected horses and farm
animals in Saugerties, which is sponsoring the screening and talk.
''It's encouraging people to hear about the industry that produces what
we eat and the impact it has on all of us.''

America's international reputation is as the land of milk and money.
Here, milk has long been thought of as not just another nutritious
beverage but as purity, even patriotism, in a glass. The title of a
recent chronicle of the rise of milk-drinking in America reflects the
national view of the beverage: Nature's Perfect Food. "In the U.S., milk
is virtually the national emblem (apple pie, in comparison, is an
also-ran)," London's Guardian pronounced last year. If pollsters asked
such questions, for most of the 20th century milk's favorability ratings
would probably have exceeded even water's. In the 1980s, milk was so
venerated that a sociologist in the New York Times linked a decrease in
its consumption to the declining public faith in all institutions, from
the church to the academy to the press to government.

Since then, America's belief in the goodness of milk has taken a darker
turn. Milk has turned from a symbol of true-blue Americana into a token
of everything that's wrong with the country. As with most cultural
changes, the transformation began with extremists, but it has crept into
mainstream discourse. Like Hulk Hogan suddenly becoming a wrestling
villain, the symbol of saying your prayers and taking your vitamins, of
right-thinking Americanness, has now become the bad guy.
...
Others have sued the federal school-lunch program for racial
discrimination for refusing to subsidize nondairy beverages without a
note from a doctor. Animal-rights advocates attack dairy farmers for
keeping cows in a state of permanent pregnancy and then selling off the
calves for veal. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals once
put Rudy Giuliani on a billboard with the tag line, "Got prostate
cancer?" The author of a book called Milk: The Deadly Poison blamed milk
for the death of Florence Griffith Joyner. Even "Got Milk?" is under
attack.

Ben Cohen, ice cream maven and TrueMajority founder, answers readers'
questions 
...
How do you feel about the contribution that avoiding animal products
makes to sustainable living, non-support of factory farming, improved
health, alleviation of world hunger, and promotion of non-violence?    
-- Mary Lou Noble, Portland, Ore.

I respect and admire vegans and vegetarians. I personally have not been
able to make such a commitment. I have reduced my consumption of meat,
especially factory-farmed meat -- although I am about to deep-fry 20
free-range turkeys for a fundraiser for the progressive mayor of
Burlington, Vt., Peter Clavelle, who is running for governor.
Contributions can be made here.


How about taking that love for the environment a step further and
offering a line of vegan ice creams? I know a lot of vegans who would be
overjoyed to resume patronizing your establishments, and I would be
first among them!    -- Keegan Roberson, San Francisco, Calif.

Anything is possible. I'm not certain if anything is coming down the
pipeline, but write/email/call the company. Why not organize a group:
Citizens for Ice Cream Choices. I bet the media would love it. Vegans
and those who are lactose-intolerant could show how big of a market they
really are.

When Jane Grigson wrote her definitive work on pork in 1967 and assumed
the mantle of scholar cook from Elizabeth David, it was French cuisine
she wanted to instruct us in. Just as much of David's passion about food
was dedicated to expanding British horizons by looking abroad, so
Grigson took her readers on a tour of provincial France and the guts of
its charcuterie.

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's latest book, a vast tome with the word
MEAT embossed defiantly in large, blood-red letters across its cover,
marks him out as worthy successor to that tradition of learned chef.
...
While admitting to great respect for vegetarians, particularly those who
refuse to eat meat as a stand against the routine cruelty and suffering
we impose on our livestock, he argues against the vegetarian position.
Historically, man has evolved eating meat as part of a mixed diet, but
he acknowledges that is not enough of a defence today. In societies
where food is plentiful, we no longer need to eat meat for health, and
in a post-Darwinian world where our biological links to the rest of the
animal kingdom are clear, animals undoubtedly come within our moral
sphere. However, he argues, any species pursuing its interests has an
impact on the rest of the planet's life. Humans inevitably affect
animals and vegetarians are no different. They upset the balance of
nature too.

Jack and David Shealy are Florida natives. In 1971, they opened Trail Lakes 
Campgrounds east of Ochopee, Fla. For generations, families have brought their 
children there to experience the wonders of the Florida Everglades. In 
addition to the natural wonders provided by the environment, the campgrounds also 
provide an array of small animals that the children can see, touch, and learn 
about ? up close and personal. 
Three weeks ago, Jack noticed that a few of his goats did not show up at 
feeding time; last week, he learned why. 
Jan Michael Jacobson knew what was happening to the goats. Jan is the 
director of the Everglades Institute, and he is an expert on the Florida panther. He 
arranged with Jack to set up a video camera in hopes of catching the culprit 
in the act. He was successful. 
Jack contacted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission and asked that the 
panther be removed. They refused, even though the commission had previously 
removed a problem panther from a nearby Indian reservation. The commission 
confirmed that the panther had killed 15 goats and two emus. Jack asked for 
compensation for his loss. They refused, suggesting that Jack's campground was the 
problem, not the panther. 
Two nights after the videoed slaughter, the panther returned and killed five 
ducks, three turkeys, two emus, two goats and one chicken ? while small 
children slept in many of the 100 sites in the 30-acre campground.

St. Johns County Animal Control is investigating a couple of incidents at Pet 
Paradise Resort where one dog was injured and another killed in attacks by 
other dogs. 
"At this point, these are mishaps until further investigation reveals 
otherwise," said Paul Studivant, supervisor of Animal Control. "We're investigating 
possible animals that could have had records in the community with aggressive 
behavior." 
Studivant spoke with the State Attorney's Office on Friday afternoon for an 
initial briefing on the issue. "This could end up being a civil issue between 
pet owners and the business," Studivant said. 
Fred Goldsmith, president of America Pet Paradise, which owns Pet Paradise 
Resort, said the attacks are tragic, but very rare. Out of 150,000 dog visits in 
the facilities in St. Augustine and Palm Coast, he said there have only been 
a half a dozen problems where a dog might have gotten into a fight or 
accidentally injured another dog while playing. Only two dogs have required stitches, 
he said. 
"We spend our entire lives trying to provide a clean, safe environment for 
our animals," he said.

NEW DELHI ? In a controversial decision, the government of India-administered 
Kashmir state plans to challenge an international ban on weaving and trading 
in the world's most expensive fabric, shahtoosh, made from the fine fur 
undercoat of the endangered Tibetan antelope known as "chiru." 
    Defying conservationists, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, chief minister of Jammu 
and Kashmir, says his government is set to ask India's highest court to end 
the 4-year-old ban. 
 
    "The ban has brought immense misery to the lives of half a million 
shahtoosh weavers, traders and their families in Kashmir. We shall do our best to 
get the ban removed to bring relief to this 600-year-old industry as soon as 
possible," said Mr. Sayeed. 
    Since 1979, the chiru has had legal protection under the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Killing, harming or trading 
in the animal is illegal worldwide, and more than 160 countries are CITES 
signatories. 
    Before the ban, poachers killed the chiru for shahtoosh ? a Persian word 
that means "king of wools" ? in the animal's habitat on the Chang Tang Plateau 
in Tibet and in China's Xinjiang autonomous region and Qinghai province. 
During their annual migration in the Ladakh region of India's Jammu and Kashmir 
state, chiru were also killed by licensed hunters before the ban.

Monkeys can stay at island home
Monkeys that roam a lush island near Beaufort won?t have to leave anytime 
soon.
A state agency chose Friday to let the animals stay on Morgan Island for at 
least two years because they produce income for South Carolina and are 
important to biomedical research nationally.
The fate of the furry primates has been clouded since the S.C. Department of 
Natural Resources bought Morgan Island in 2002 for $20.5 million.
Agency officials had to decide whether they should round up the monkeys so 
the animals would not damage the nearly pristine environment of Morgan Island.
Rhesus monkeys are native to Asia, but they have been kept and bred on the 
400-acre island for use in medical experiments since 1979.
The island, like others near Beaufort, is filled with live oak trees and 
palmettos and is bordered by salt marsh. Song birds and increasingly rare shore 
birds, such as the oyster catcher, are found in the area.
But the DNR hasn?t seen any evidence monkeys are wrecking maritime forests 
that attract birds to Morgan Island, according to an agency management plan. And 
DNR director John Frampton said the federal medical research program depended 
heavily on Morgan Island as a supplier of monkeys. The island is the country?
s only free-range breeding colony for rhesus monkeys, the agency says.
?This is one of the best populations of monkeys anywhere for medical purposes,
?? Frampton said.
?I have difficulty .... recommending those monkeys be taken off when there?s 
not another place to put them.??

MIDVALE -- The FBI has seized a fax machine from a University of Utah
health clinic it says was used to announce a claim of responsibility for
a lumberyard fire under investigation as a possible act of ecoterrorism.

The group, called the Earth Liberation Front, claimed in a fax to a Salt
Lake City news station Tuesday that it set Monday's fire in West Jordan
that caused $1.5 million in damage.

FBI agents traced the fax to the Greenwood Health Clinic, special agent
Bob Wright said Friday.

The FBI took the clinic's fax machine Thursday, and sent it to the
agency's crime lab in Washington.

There, Wright said the bureau will conduct a number of DNA, fingerprint
and microscopic analyses.

TAYLOR -- Ralph Caputo always tried to instill respect for animals in
his children.

Now, he has the respect of an international animal rights organization.

Mr. Caputo's daughter, Cassandra, 8, wrote an essay about her dad and is
one of five winners in the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals'
"World's Kindest Dad" essay contest.

Cassandra's mother, Lisa Caputo, said she noticed the contest on PETA2's
Web site. She helped her daughter, a student at St. Mary's School, Old
Forge, send out the essay online.

LIVERMORE -- Local residents looking to experience the Big Top in a big
way, can attend Circus Chimera's 2004 tour next week in Livermore.

The show, titled "Wonders of the World," features Superclown, a comic
superhero seeking to save the world from gloom with his only power --
the ability to make people laugh.

Don't look for any tigers, or elephants, though: Circus Chimera doesn't
use animal acts.

An unusual mix of acrobatics and aerial artistry, the event combines
extraordinary human feats, yet focuses on theatrical expression. 
...
"We don't have any animal acts, which means we have a lot of support
from animal rights groups," he said. "This is our first trip we've taken
to the Tri-Valley area, and we're looking to provide a great show for
everyone."

PALOMINO VALLEY, Nev. -- Wild-horse advocates who reject the government's 
claim that 32,000 horses are overrunning parts of the West say some of the 
millions of cattle grazing public rangeland should be removed before any more 
mustangs are rounded up.

With more than half the wild horses located in Nevada, opponents of the 
roundups have been staging weekly demonstrations the past two months at the state 
capitol in Carson City.
They also have picketed in front of the Bureau of Land Management office in 
Reno to protest the BLM's efforts to cut wild horse populations nearly in half 
across the West.

"If the BLM truly feels our public lands are being so greatly damaged by 
grazing animals, why aren't privately owned livestock on our public lands being 
reduced in number as well?" asked Bonnie Matton of the horse advocacy group, We 
the People for Wild Horses and Burros.

BLM officials and ranching industry leaders say they have been reduced. The 
number of cattle grazing on public lands has dropped dramatically over the 
years, they say, to about half the number that were on the range when Congress 
passed the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act in 1971.

They say an overpopulation of wild horses is harming the range and 
threatening the overall well-being of the horse herds at a time when much of the West 
remains in the grip of a five-year drought.

Ron Gillett has amassed stacks and stacks of documents, newspaper clippings, 
bumper stickers and e-mail printouts in his crusade to remove wolves from 
Idaho.
Wolves and elk
Here's a sampling of what biologists know about wolves and elk:
? Elk and wolves evolved together, but both face changed conditions because 
of humans.
? The number of elk counted in northern Yellowstone has dropped from 19,359 
in 1994 to 8,355 in December 2003. In the 1960s, rangers killed elk to keep the 
herd at about 3,500. The reduction of elk has increased vegetation such as 
aspen trees in the park.
? The critical calf-cow ratio has shown a significant drop in Yellowstone and 
Jackson Hole, but biologists aren't sure wolves are the sole cause.
? In central Idaho, calf-cow ratio trends are mixed, with a decline in the 
Middle Fork of the Salmon River area but increases in portions of the Clearwater 
country in north-central Idaho since the 1990s.
? Wildlife managers in Canada and Alaska, where wolf populations are strong, 
regularly manage game herds by increasing hunting seasons, or even hiring 
hunters to kill wolves so that big game numbers rebound faster.

It's not an uncommon sight in this city of 7.2 million to see an elephant and 
its mahout, or trainer, come lumbering along, sometimes causing a traffic 
jam. Elephants visit almost every major urban center in Thailand, including the 
edges of sprawling Bangkok, begging for food. 
The Asian elephant may still be a revered cultural icon in this country, 
gracing bas-reliefs of temples and serving as the royal emblem of the monarchy, 
but these days, it is woefully unemployed. 
Worse, in a country whose civilization was more or less built on its back, 
the elephant is fast disappearing. More than 100,000 existed at the beginning of 
last century. At the beginning of the 21st, there were fewer than 5,000 -- 
2,000 of them still in the wild. 
Now classified as an endangered species, the Asian elephant is expected to 
disappear from the country altogether -- except perhaps in zoos and a few nature 
reserves -- around 2050. 
There are many reasons why Asian elephants are disappearing, but the main 
culprit -- the scourge of all wildlife -- is deforestation. For domesticated 
elephants, deforestation means that they no longer have jobs. Logging in 
Thailand's forests have always relied on the power of powerful pachyderms.

Faith Fippinger is serving a three-month sentence at Coleman Federal
Correctional Complex for trespassing during a protest at the Fort
Benning Army base in Georgia. She is waiting to find out how she?ll be
punished for earlier violating U.S. sanctions against travel to Iraq.
...
The part of the prison where Fippinger is held is called Camp.

It has no razor wire and no clanging bars. The inmates could bolt for
Highway 470 if they got the urge.

For a woman who once lived for two years without electricity or running
water on the Alaskan tundra, the conditions aren't bad.

She gets vegetarian meals and takes a yoga class. She works in
landscaping, which is as close to gardening as she could get. She drives
a noisy lawn tractor and there, silenced by the roar, she can do her
Buddhist chants as loud as she wants.

Buddha Buddha may I become just like you.

Police in Portland and nine other cities across the country received an
FBI bulletin earlier this month warning that radical environmentalists
planned to protest on June 12, and that "eco-terrorism" could not be
ruled out.

Portland police responded by stepping up patrols where "eco-terrorists"
might hit and by placing the building the FBI warned them about under
surveillance.

The targets of the bulletin and the surveillance, however, turned out to
be events publicized on the Internet to gather support for an Oregon
activist jailed for arson. Portland police kept an eye on the Peoples
Free Space on Congress Street, where about 25 people watched a video
about the activist, Jeff "Free" Luers.

There was no terrorism - eco or otherwise - in any of the cities. But
supporters of the activist are raising questions about whether it was
appropriate for the FBI to issue the warning in the first place. They
say that the bureau overstepped its bounds by linking peaceful,
well-publicized events with terrorism, and that the surveillance was
designed by the FBI to chill political speech.
...
Supporters of Luers, though, say the law enforcement response was both a
waste of time and an inappropriate infringement on their First Amendment
rights.

They note that while members of the ELF generally admit their
affiliation with the loosely knit organization once they have been
arrested, Luers has consistently denied being part of it. Even Ron
Arnold, the author of "Eco Terror: The Violent Agenda to Save Nature"
and one of the ELF's most vocal critics, says he doubts Luers is a
member of the group - and said the prison sentence is so harsh that it
"cheapens the justice system."

When Morgan Spurlock stuffed himself with junk food until his doctors
begged him to stop, he threw an industry into a super-size crisis. Now a
fierce corporate counter-attack has begun.
...
To say this is a public relations disaster for McDonald's is a gross
understatement. It is a nightmare that shows no signs of ending.
Spurlock has - almost literally - regurgitated the contents of his
high-fat, high-sugar diet on to the collective desks of McDonald's
management, and they appear to be at a loss as to what to do about it.

For the first five weeks, they restricted their responses to little more
than a generic observation that overeating is bad on any diet. No doubt
they reasoned that kicking up a bigger fuss would generate further
publicity for the movie. But that hush-hush strategy clearly has not
worked, and the company has now begun to fight back in more vigorous
fashion. The chosen battleground is not the US but Australia, where
Super Size Me was released earlier this month and broke national box
office records with its opening weekend receipts.

"If someone from America produces a film, and then comes out to
Australia and attacks us, I'm not going to take that sitting down," the
chief executive of McDonald's Australia, Guy Russo, said earlier this
week. 
...
To date, McDonald's has not challenged the factual content of Super Size
Me, only its point of view and interpretation. But that, too, could be
about to change, after Mr Russo complained in an interview with Sky TV
that Spurlock was "providing false claims to Australians".

He did not spell out what those false claims might be, and both Spurlock
and the film's Australian publicists have taken great pleasure in
pointing out that Mr Russo's opinions on the point appear to have
undergone a radical change. "Less than two weeks ago when I was in
Brisbane," Spurlock shot back a few days ago, "he and I did an interview
together on a radio station where he said the movie was important
because it highlighted the obesity epidemic."

Whatever the rights and wrongs of these points of view, it is clear that
a propaganda war is in progress, and that something made Mr Russo decide
that playing nice wasn't working. But playing nasty is having boomerang
effects of its own.

FORESTRY companies have shot nearly 50,000 wallabies and possums to protect 
forests and plantations over the past two years, Department of Primary 
Industries documents show.

Shooters employed by Gunns Ltd and Forestry Tasmania shot 15,225 brushtail 
possums and 30,226 Bennetts and red wallabies in the period between January 2002 
and April 30 this year. 
The figures from the Nature Conservation Branch were obtained by The Mercury 
under the Freedom of Information Act. 
Sixteen fallow deer were also shot during the same period. 
Eighty per cent of the animals were shot on behalf of Gunns Ltd on 250,000ha 
of forest and plantation across the state. 
Most animals were killed with shotguns and spotlight, with live trapping and 
shooting also widespread. 
Wilderness Society campaign co-ordinator Geoff Law said the figures 
demonstrated one of the massive impacts of industrial forestry. 
"This shows that a vast number of animals, which are otherwise protected, are 
being killed," he said. 
Mr Law said the figures were a "reality check" and an indication that 
probably more than 500,000 animals were killed by 1080. 
Increased shooting has resulted because the State Government wants 1080 usage 
reduced.

Encounters between humans and wildlife will no doubt increase as development 
shrinks the buffer between city and wildland. 
How well we handle such encounters will be a reflection of how responsibly we 
grow, how well we educate ourselves and how engaged we become on wildlife 
policies, according to a panel of experts who met at the Arizona Daily Star this 
month. 
While incidents with individual animals make news and evoke emotional 
responses, the big picture demands a much wider lens, said naturalist and writer 
Jonathan Hanson. Biologically speaking, it's the health of the entire species that 
matters, not any single animal, he said. 
"If people would lobby their congressman for more mountain-lion habitat, 
they'd do far more good for mountain lions as a species than shrieking when one 
gets killed," Hanson said. 
As the "apex predator," what's good for mountain lions is good for the entire 
ecosystem below them, said wildlife biologist Lisa Haynes. 
"If we have a healthy mountain-lion population, we probably have a pretty 
healthy environment for both wildlife and for people," Haynes said. "The biggest 
threat to mountain lions in the future is urban sprawl. ? The bulldozers are 
scraping away."

WOODSTOCK, N.Y. - If you're road-tripping this summer, chances are
you'll end up at one of those nondescript highway rest stops that serve
mainly juicy burgers, greasy fries and syrupy soft drinks. But the way
food gurus Nikki and David Goldbeck see it, travel is no excuse for
eating badly.

The couple, who penned several nutrition books including the 1973 best
seller "The Supermarket Handbook," like to avoid the fast food chains
that dot the nation's interstates whenever they drive from their
Woodstock home to the warmth of Florida's Miami Beach every winter.
...
The Goldbecks recently compiled their favorite eateries, along with
other listings discovered through their own research or recommended by
other health-conscious travelers, into a new book aimed at giving
travelers a nutritious alternative.

"Healthy Highways: The Traveler's Guide to Healthy Eating" lists about
2,000 health-oriented restaurants and natural food stores in the 50
states - all easily accessible from the exit ramp of a highway or a
major road. Telephone numbers and hours of operation are also included.

MINNEAPOLIS - Cherie Englund has been an organic shopper for more than
three years, after concluding that an organic diet helped ease the
chronic health problems of her 7-year-old son, Jon.

So the Oakdale mother shops at the River Market Community Co-op in
Stillwater.

"I'm convinced that organic is the way to go," Englund said. "If (Jon)
is feeling better, he does better in school. And it's just easier to
live in the house when the kids are doing well."

Shoppers like Englund have put organic and natural foods solidly in the
mainstream. One of every 10 U.S. food dollars now is spent on organic
and natural foods, accounting for about $43 billion of the nation's
overall food spending of $433 billion. That's up 72 percent over the
last five years.

With consumers concerned about everything from mad cow disease to
genetically modified food, analysts say organic and natural foods are
only beginning their growth.
...
Local activist and entrepreneur Michael Martin is launching a nationwide
caravan this year to promote organic foods. ONE, the Organic Natural
Experience, is sponsored by a half-dozen organic heavyweights, including
Annie's Pasta, the Clif Bar and Odwalla juices.

Martin's company, Music Matters, made its name promoting concerts for
the environment. Martin got interested in organic food after surviving a
bout with bladder cancer, which he blames on childhood exposure to farm
chemicals.

The ONE caravan will cross the country from Boston to Seattle and points
in between, including a stop in Minneapolis. But Martin said the plan
calls for a focus on places not normally known as hotbeds of organic
activity.

"We're not trying to go to the extreme green places," he said. "Joe
Sixpack needs to understand that it's not about lentils, it's not about
hippies anymore."

        <docText>For Wanda and Winky, this fall will bring a new home, warmer 
weather, and spacious grounds. For visitors to the Detroit Zoo, it will mean the 
loss of a big - several wrinkled tons, actually - attraction. 
The zoo's recent announcement that it won't keep its aging Asian elephants 
because it can't give them the space, companionship, and climate they need has 
caused more than a few ripples in Detroit - and the zoo community nationwide. 
After all, a zoo without elephants?
Is there ever a good reason to keep a wild animal in captivity?
Yes. Humanely treated animals provide valuable educational opportunities.
Yes. Zoos can provide refuge for abandoned or endangered creatures.
No. Wildlife belong in their natural habitats, not confined in zoos.
   


                                                                            
But in a world in which goldfish have their own vets, horses get spa 
treatments, and a number of communities have espoused pet "guardianship," the Detroit 
Zoo's decision is one more sign of humans' changing relationship with animals.
Zoos nowadays are as apt to evoke sympathy for the caged creatures as 
curiosity. People are both more aware of animals' needs - emotional and physical - 
and less willing to tolerate abuse. Between vocal animal rights campaigns and 
hit films like "Free Willy" and "Finding Nemo," a fundamental shift is taking 
place in public consciousness: Animals are being treated, essentially, more like 
humans. "It's like we're waking up from a deep cultural sleep," says Tom 
Regan, an animal rights ethicist and author of "Empty Cages." Animals are 
somebodies, not somethings. That's what I think we're waking up to."

LOS ANGELES -- Fire ripped through luxury homes under construction in Washington state. Molotov cocktails ignited sport-utility vehicles in Virginia. Graffiti coated a dozen SUVs in Santa Fe, N.M. All in the name of Mother Earth -- and all apparently the work of a shadowy environmental group known as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF).
In its ongoing guerrilla campaign to promote its environmentalist agenda, ELF has claimed responsibility for more than a dozen acts of sabotage across the nation in the past year, causing more than $60 million in damage. ELF sees unbridled capitalism leading to uncontrolled suburban sprawl and believes the SUV epitomizes the over-consumption that is running amok in the United States. Federal and local law enforcement authorities say the group's attacks are becoming more frequent and more destructive. 
No longer content to direct their wrath at lumberjacks cutting trees deep in the forest, members of ELF -- known as elves -- are increasingly targeting suburbia, especially the new developments that are encroaching on wilderness.
When a $50 million condominium complex under construction in San Diego was torched last summer, in what authorities are calling the most destructive act of eco-terrorism on U.S. soil, investigators discovered a banner at the site. It read: "If you build it, we will burn it." It was signed: "The E.L.F.s are mad."
The loosely organized underground movement is continuing to frustrate law enforcement officials across the country. Only a few arrests have been made in the past five years, and there have been even fewer convictions. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in rewards have been offered by authorities, and additional FBI agents have been assigned to investigations involving the group. 
Unlike traditional criminal enterprises such as the mob or biker gangs with rigid hierarchies that have been successfully infiltrated by undercover agents, there is no formal club for officials to break into.
Federal investigators and prosecutors have expressed frustration at the difficulties of cracking down on multi-state campaigns of low-level crimes, intimidation and property damage because of a lack of applicable federal laws.
"Law enforcement is geared to catch the common criminal. These people are criminals, but they are not of the common variety," said Gary R. Perlstein, a professor in the administration of justice division at Portland State University. "They've read the law enforcement manuals. They try not to make mistakes."
ELF's Web site offers links to wide-ranging instructions, from how to build Molotov cocktails to recognizing surveillance by government agents to encrypting computer activity. Arson is the weapon of choice.
On its Web site, ELF invites people to commit acts of destruction and e-mail the group detailing their deeds. A claim of responsibility appears on the Web site a few days later. The group urges members to take all necessary precautions against harming humans and animals.
Ron Arnold, the author of several books on the environmental movement who coined the term eco-terrorism, said that delaying a claim of responsibility for a few days after the incident is a strategic move by the group to make sure no one was hurt or killed. 
The FBI has been studying the group's recruiting efforts in recent years. "These tend to be younger, college-age students with a typically ideological thought process, and they have an idea of the way things should be," said Robert Blecksmith, chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section. 
ELF is divided into cells, ranging from three to 10 members, said Craig Rosebraugh, the group's former spokesman. He said in an interview that members of one cell have no contact with members of another so that they cannot implicate others.
In August, vandals claiming to be members of ELF were caught on surveillance tape spray-painting 125 SUVs at car dealerships and homes in the Los Angeles area. The vehicles, which were also firebombed by unknown assailants, were splashed with slogans such as "Fat, Lazy Americans" and "I H pollution." Two suspects have fled the country, but agents arrested California Institute of Technology physics graduate student William Jensen Cottrell. 
Cottrell, 23, has denied being an ELF member. 
"I'm not an environmental activist," Cottrell said in an interview at the San Bernardino Central Detention Center. "I'm just environmentally aware. I support some illegal actions for environmental causes basically because writing letters doesn't work. Who are you going to write a letter to? Arnold Schwarzenegger, who owns six Hummers, or George Bush, who comes from the oil industry?"
When he found out he was being investigated by the FBI, Cottrell contemplated fleeing but decided to stay put. He pleaded not guilty in March to nine counts of arson and conspiracy, and faces as much as 35 years in prison if convicted. The trial is scheduled for October.
"If you just run, nothing happens. This way, more attention gets drawn to the problems with the government and their environmental policy," Cottrell said. "Of course, if I get 30 years, I'll think, damn, why didn't I run?"
In one of the most recent prosecutions, a federal jury acquitted Connor Cash, 22, of arson and terrorism charges last month. He had been charged with damaging five homes under construction on Long Island, N.Y. Two admitted ELF members pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with that incident.
In March, Canadian authorities arrested Tre Arrow on shoplifting charges in Victoria, B.C. Arrow is wanted by the FBI in connection with the 2001 bombings of several logging and cement trucks in Oregon. He has been on the run since being indicted in 2002 and is seeking refugee status in Canada to avoid extradition to the United States. 
In January, three Virginia teenagers pleaded guilty to vandalizing fast-food restaurants and damaging construction equipment in 2002 on behalf of ELF. Authorities say they unraveled another ELF plot when they arrested four teenagers in February planning to vandalize SUVs near Richmond.
No one has died as a result of any action claimed by ELF, but authorities are concerned that someone will be injured or killed. "Their goal is to try to maintain this Robin Hood mystique about them. They're not Robin Hood. They are very destructive, and it's just a matter of time before someone dies as a result of their acts," said Rep. Scott McInnis (R-Colo.). McInnis represented the Vail area when a 1998 fire at a ski resort there caused $12 million in damage. ELF has claimed responsibility for the fire. The case remains unsolved.
And when large-scale arson attacks make the nightly news, the general public tends to lump all the environmentalists together instead of separating the mainstream groups from the radicals, McInnis said. "This only hurts the message that legitimate environmental groups are trying to put forward."

As San Francisco police were arresting more than 150 people protesting
the Biotechnology Industry Organization last week, an FBI agent stood
inside the conference center, speaking to a group of scientists,
pharmaceutical reps, and biotech executives. His message: The FBI
considers ecoterrorism and animal terrorism the country's leading
domestic terror threats.

That's news to the folks who lost loved ones in the attack on the World
Trade Center buildings. So far, "ecoterrorists" like the Earth
Liberation Front and "animal terrorists" (a term that conjures up images
of lab rats with explosives strapped to their bellies) like the Animal
Liberation Front have engaged in property destruction and the disruption
of laboratory experiments, not the outright physical violence of, for
example, antiabortion extremists who've murdered doctors and clinic
staff and spit on and shoved pregnant women attempting to enter women's
health clinics.

Among most of the people I know, the general fear is not of a bunch of
animal activists freeing mink from a mink farm. It's a growing fear of
another kind of domestic terrorism: the depredations of our own
government. 
...
Meanwhile the FBI continues to target domestic dissent as its top
priority, even after John Ashcroft announced that Al Qaeda was planning
another attack on U.S. soil sometime in the near future, possibly this
summer. No one in the servile, mainstream press has pointed out the
contradiction, but those of us who feel and express a profound
discontent with our government see the overall trend: the terrorists are
not foreign; they're the people who police our streets, tap our phone
lines, monitor our spending habits, and decide who can go free and who
will be terrorized.

The above article will appear in the June 16, 2004 edition of Eat The
State!

The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to
notify industry officials of positive mad cow test results at least one
hour before informing the public, according to a meat industry
newsletter obtained by United Press International.

The revelation comes as government officials are being investigated for
possibly leaking information about the first U.S. case of mad cow in
December to commodity traders prior to telling the public.

The USDA launched an expanded surveillance program June 1 in response to
the December case that involves initially screening cows with a rapid
test. Those tests can yield false positives, so they are being
categorized as inconclusive until confirmed by additional tests.

The woman known as the "Dog Lady" in Liberty County has no more dogs.

At a hearing Monday, Patsy Boucher, a 58-year-old retired truck driver,
was forced not only to permanently relinquish her 121 dogs; but also
three pigs, three guinea pigs, one cat, seven finches and a cockatiel
that can whistle the theme to The Bridge on the River Kwai.

Justice of the Peace Burl Thomas ordered the animals turned over to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Houston after
investigators testified that Boucher's two-room wooden house and
half-acre lot about 35 miles north of Houston was unfit for both humans
and animals. Precinct 5 Constable L.W. DeSpain said the stench from the
urine and feces inside the house and around the yard was so strong that
he vomited after he entered the property with a warrant to temporarily
seize the animals June 1.

Boucher, who represented herself at Monday's hearing, berated Liberty
County for refusing to spend the money needed to provide an animal
shelter for the many strays dumped in the county's rural areas.

"I have done nothing wrong but take stray dogs off the streets with
nowhere else to go. I admit to being overwhelmed," she said while
crying, "but I have never done anything cruel. I love my dogs. Now
they're going to be euthanized."

ATHENS, Ga. -- A University of Georgia fraternity member who is accused
of killing a raccoon with a pellet gun has withdrawn two motions aimed
at having an animal cruelty charge against him dropped.

Erik Robert Zimmerman, 20, of Marble, N.C., was arrested after a Dec. 12
incident in which he used a pellet gun to shoot and kill a raccoon that
was behaving erratically.

Another member of Zimmerman's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity skinned the
animal and another cooked and ate the raccoon's meat. The other students
involved in the incident - fraternity members Patrick Perry and Ivan
Garcia - do not face criminal charges because they did not participate
in killing the raccoon.

A PRETORIA couple will soon be the proud parents of a bouncing cloned baby 
girl . This is the fantastical claim of Dr Brigitte Boisselier, head of the 
infamous reproduction company Clonaid and a bishop in the Ra?lian Movement, which 
believes space aliens created humans through cloning. 
"We believe that one day we will be able to use cloning technology to grow a 
body in a few minutes, " says Boisselier, in SA to promote the movement's 
philosophy and espouse the benefits of human cloning. 
In addition to checking the progress of the Pretoria clone Boisselier says 
the mother is three months pregnant she is meeting prospective customers and 
political leaders, whom she declines to name. 
She says she has met health ministers from several, again unnamed, African 
countries but is not planning to meet Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang 
on this trip. 
Las Vegas-based Clonaid triggered worldwide attention 18 months ago when it 
claimed to have cloned two human babies, a girl called Eve born to an American 
couple, and another girl born to a Dutch lesbian couple. 
The claims were met with increasing scepticism and condemnation as Boisselier 
steadfastly refused to provide details of where the babies were born, or 
evidence that they were exact genetic replicas of their mothers. 
Scientists such as Harry Griffin, head of Scotland's Roslin Institute, which 
cloned Dolly the sheep, dismissed the claims as a "publicity stunt". 
Boisselier says she has not published proof of the 13 cloned babies she has 
helped create because she "fears for her safety".

   Some Portlanders would no sooner fish their dinner from the Willamette 
River than they would hunt for wild game in Forest Park.
   Others, like Terry Gallant and Mike Klopfenstein, have been fishing the 
Willamette for years and have no plans to stop now that summer&#x2019;s returning.
   So how safe is the Willamette for fishing?
   It depends on what you&#x2019;re catching. The latest data shows that migratory 
fish like spring Chinook salmon are as clean as fish get, while resident 
fish such as small-mouthed bass are often dangerously loaded with 
polychlorinated biphenyls, toxic pesticides, dioxin and other contaminants.
   As for sturgeon, the ancient fish that Gallant and Klopfenstein were 
pursuing on a recent morning on the Willamette, new tests show that they 
also contain some toxins, though at much lower levels than bass, carp and 
other resident fish.
   State and county health officials are issuing an updated fish advisory 
this week and posting new signs along the river warning of the health risks 
of eating fish caught in the Willamette.
   The latest data show that carp contain the most PCBs, at around 2 parts 
per million, while bass have about 1 part per million and bullhead catfish 
contain approximately 0.5 parts per million.
   Based on those levels of PCBs, scientists are recommending that women 
beyond childbearing age and healthy men should eat no more than 8 ounces of 
resident fish from the Willamette per month. Women of childbearing age, 
children and anyone with a weak immune system or thyroid or liver problems 
should avoid eating any carp, bass or catfish from the Willamette, according 
to the health advisory.
   The new warnings follow a massive fish collection effort performed two 
years ago. As part of the Portland harbor Superfund investigation, 
scientists caught about 1,500 fish from the lower Willamette and sent them 
off to labs to be tested for 399 chemicals.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency still has not released the 
results from those tests publicly. But David Stone, a toxicologist with the 
state&#x2019;s health department, confirmed that the fish advisory and the new 
batch of warning signs were a direct result of the Superfund investigation.
   &#x201c;We already knew (the pollutants) were in the river sediment, but I think 
some people are surprised at how much turned up in the fish,&#x201d; Stone said.

As Illinoisans, the only way we can stop our senators and representatives 
from doing what we have so strongly voiced our opposition against ["Horse 
slaughter bill not done yet, senate sponsor says," June 2, 2004], is by not 
re-electing them. 
There are so many farms around this country who take these gracious beauties. 
Why don't the owners give them away? Are they having them slaughtered for the 
almighty dollar which they can line their greedy little pockets with? 
I have seen programs where these lovely horses are taken to auctions and sold 
for their meat. Individuals and organizations come in and buy as many as they 
can so they won't be senselessly slaughtered. My hand goes up to them! 
What is our society turning into? It seems to me that people get tired of 
what they have, no matter who will be affected by it. They just toss it away like 
a piece of trash only to replace it with something different or new. Has our 
society become so calloused that they can kill an innocent animal because it's 
a burden on their pocketbook? 
What is this teaching our children who will be our country's leaders someday? 
Oh, it's OK to get rid of this animal because it's too costly; don't love it 
anymore; it's too old, or just tired of it. Eventually we, as a society, will 
not matter at all. Our lives will be worthless. 
This county has lost so much of its moral character. Why don't we, as 
concerned citizens, stand up and fight for what we believe instead of sitting 
passively and doing nothing? It is our right and duty as citizens that we band 
together and show our elected officials we are not going to take it anymore -- 
before it's too late.

IBERIA -- An official with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says 
the organization has received numerous complaints concerning a plan to use a 
homemade gas chamber to kill problem dogs in Iberia.

The police policy in Iberia had been to shoot vicious dogs. When that policy 
came under fire earlier this year, city officials moved to develop a program 
to gas dogs deemed dangerous by police. 
That solution has not been popular with some people.

"Our doctor called the Iberia mayor because we have been inundated with calls 
from people outraged over the shootings in Iberia," said Daphna 
Nachminovitch, director of PETA's Domestic and Wildlife Rescue and Information Department 
in West Virginia. "We share their concern about the city's movement to use a 
carbon monoxide gas chamber to kill dogs."

In the last several months, the small rural town of 650 located at the 
crossroads of Highways 42 and 17 in Miller County has been overrun with packs of 
stray dogs. The dogs have been credited with numerous attacks on residents, 
rummaging through trash and causing problems. 

Mayor Bob Crawford said the town has been forced to shoot dogs in at least 
three cases where residents or police had been attacked.

The debate continues on whether the three dogs caught in the middle of the 
controversial trailside shooting case should be held as evidence at the 
Flagstaff dog pound or released to guardians while the case creeps its way through the 
justice system. 
Harold Fish, 57, has now been charged with second-degree murder for shooting 
43-year-old Payson Humane Society volunteer Grant Kuenzli. 
If Fish is indicted by a grand jury Thursday, the dogs could be locked up 
indefinitely while the case goes to trial.
Maggie, a yellow retriever-mix, Hank, a red chow-mix and Sheba, a 
brown-and-black shepherd-mix, have been in 4-by-6-foot kennels at the Flagstaff Humane 
Society since May 11 -- the night Fish shot and killed Kuenzli at a trailhead 
south of Clint's Well.
  
Fish said he was under attack by two of the dogs and then Kuenzli, who he 
said came running at him with a "crazed look in his eyes."
Fish fired a warning shot at the ground in front of the dogs and they 
dispersed. He then fired three rounds from his 10mm semi-automatic handgun into 
Kuenzli's chest.
Tom and Marilyn Iverson are looking for an attorney to represent the interest 
of the three dogs who could be euthanized because of Fish's allegations. The 
Iversons owned 30-pound Sheba for three years until their living situation 
changed and they were forced to give her up.

Two nubile women in bikinis wrestled in public in a pool of tofu
yesterday. They literally halted traffic in downtown San Diego.

The women were trying to make a point about the evils of eating meat and
the benefits of consuming more healthy foods ? like tofu, for instance.
The exhibition wasn't very appetizing. 

"Is that oatmeal?" one passer-by inquired as the two women, both members
of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, squealed and splattered
each other with handfuls of tan-colored mush.

Tofu, a custardlike product made from soybeans, doesn't ordinarily look
like oatmeal. But by the time the young women had stomped on it and
rubbed it all over each other's bodies ? to the appreciation of a
leering, mostly male crowd ? the tofu had liquefied into a watery vat of
lumpy gunk. 
...
PETA is a militant group that wages campaigns against animal-research
facilities and fast-food chains, employing catchy slogans such as "Eat
your veggies, not your friends."

        <docText>Our Treatment of Animals and the
Holocaust (New York: Lantern Books, 2002)--the groundbreaking book by
historian and Holocaust educator Charles Patterson, Ph.D.--is fast becoming
an international sensation.

Two years after its publication in the United States it has already been
translated into five languages (Croatian, Czech, German, Italian, Polish)
with more publishers around the world considering it for possible
publication.

The book's title comes from the Yiddish writer and Nobel Laureate, Isaac
Bashevis Singer, to whom the book is dedicated. He was the first major
modern author to describe the exploitation and slaughter of animals in terms
of the Holocaust. "In relation to them, all people are Nazis," he wrote,
"for animals it is an eternal Treblinka." (Treblinka was the Nazi death camp
north of Warsaw.)

ETERNAL TREBLINKA examines the common roots of animal and human oppression
and the similarities between how the Nazis treated their victims and how
human society treats animals slaughtered for food.

The first part of the book describes the emergence of humans as the "master
species" and how it has come to dominate the earth and its other
inhabitants. The second part examines the industrialization of slaughter (of
both animals and humans) in modern times, while the last part of the book
profiles Holocaust-connected Jewish and German animal advocates on both
sides of the Holocaust, including Isaac Bashevis Singer himself.

The Foreword is by Lucy Rosen Kaplan, the daughter of Holocaust survivors,
who is a former attorney for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA).

During the three years Patterson spent writing the book, three literary
agents tried unsuccessfully to place it (a couple of publishers said the
book was "too strong"). In all, 83 publishers declined to accept the book
before Lantern Books finally published it in 2002.

Almost immediately the book began attracting the attention of foreign
publishers, and soon translations were underway.

In April, 2003, the Roman publishing house of Editori Riuniti published the
Italian edition (UN'ETERNA TREBLINKA), and the following month "Vega!POL"
published the Polish edition (WIECZNA TREBLINKA).

In September the Publishing House Prah in Prague published the Czech edition
(VECNA TREBLINKA), which has been reviewed favorably by various leading
publications, including the literature/history/arts magazine ALTERNATIVA,
the quarterly DOKORAN, a bulletin of Czech Writers' Guild, and the LITERARNI
NOVINY, the most important and widely read literary newspaper in the Czech
Republic.

ETERNAL TREBLINKA has also been translated into German (scheduled for
publication by Versand Dienst GmbH, Frankfurt am Main in August) and is
being translated into Croatian for publication in Zagreb later this year.

Publishing houses in Spain, France, The Netherlands, Norway, Chile, India,
and Israel are also reviewing the book for possible publication.

Here's What They're Saying--

"I urge you to read ETERNAL TREBLINKA and think deeply about its important
message. " --Dr. Jane Goodall

"Compelling, controversial, iconoclastic...strongly recommended...a unique
contribution." --Midwest Book Review

"ETERNAL TREBLINKA should be on every list of essential reading for an
informed citizenry...for the compelling comprehensiveness of the
life-and-death story it tells." --National Jewish Post &amp; Opinion

"The whole effect is a very powerful document...No one who reads this book
will fail to be moved." --Anglican Society for the Welfare of Animals

"A must read! -- how mistreatment of animals leads to the dehumanization and
extermination of people as 'mere animals.' Well-written and respectful of
both Judaism and the Holocaust." --Rabbi Yonassan Gershom

"There are good books...entertaining, useful, informative; great
books...whose message reveals a fundamental truth previously unknown or
overlooked; and important books...that can save lives and ameliorate
suffering: ETERNAL TREBLINKA is all three." --Satya Magazine, New York City

"The moral challenge posed by ETERNAL TREBLINKA turns it into a must for
anyone who seeks to delve into the universal lesson of the Holocaust."
--Maariv (Israeli newspaper)

"Important and timely...written with great sensitivity and compassion...I
hope that ETERNAL TREBLINKA will be widely read." --Martyrdom and Resistance
(Holocaust publication)

"Every so often a book is written that has the potential to make an
incredible difference. ETERNAL TREBLINKA is one such book." --N. Glenn
Perrett

"Thorough and thought-provoking book" --Ha'aretz (Israeli newspaper)

"It is seldom that such a comprehensive work of scholarship springs from a
heart of compassion in the service of a noble and necessary idea. All the
ingredients of your thesis--that the oppression of animals serves as the
model for all other forms of oppression--have been available to thinking
people for generations, but it remained for you to pull them together."
--Helen Weaver, author of THE DAISY SUTRA

"Powerful, moving, gut-wrenching, brilliant--destined to be a classic"
--Aviva Cantor, journalist and author

"You must read this carefully documented book" --La Stampa (Italian national
newspaper)

"...promises to be one of the most influential books of the 21st century."
--Dr. Karen Davis, United Poultry Concerns

"It grips like a thriller." --The Freethinker (UK)

"This book is going to change the world."
--Albert Kaplan, Albert Kaplan &amp; Co., Johns Island, SC

A judge will soon decide whether former Puppy World owner Machelle Martin's 
animal abuse trial is moved to another county. 
Attorneys questioned a panel of 40 people Tuesday on what they knew about 
Martin's case to determine whether she could get a fair trial, in light of the 
media coverage of her case. 
Martin is charged with 33 counts of animal abuse and neglect in connection 
with Puppy World, which closed in late January after Martin's business license 
was revoked by the state. Officials said the Ingram Mill Road store had failed 
several inspections. 
Martin's public defender Brady Musgrave asked Associate Greene County Circuit 
Judge Mark Fitzsimmons to relocate the trial, citing a high probability of a 
mistrial. He observed that 95 percent of the mock jury pool questioned Tuesday 
had heard of Martin's animal abuse case in some manner.

Oregon?s 2004 big-game auction and raffle hunts have raised almost $370,000 
for programs to improve conditions for critters and to promote hunter access, 
officials with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said.

Drawings were held May 22 for raffles involving hunting tags for four deer, 
four elk, one combination deer and elk, one pronghorn antelope, one Rocky 
Mountain goat and one bighorn sheep hunt.

Names were pulled out of the drum during a banquet at the Oregon Hunters 
Association convention in Portland.

Money raised from both the raffles and the auctions goes into the state?s 
Access and Habitat Program. Money from the fund is parceled out for projects 
throughout the state.

The last of the auction tags also was sold at the association convention.

Others had gone on the blocks earlier in the year at a variety of banquets 
held by various hunter organizations, including the convention.

Rap Singer Announces New Arrivals to his Animal Ranch Family


r'Bear, an award winner musician and local resident, announced 
yesterday that he has added over 500 new animals to his exotic 
animal sanctuary, Shraavana, since April.

I'm like, you know, a new Daddy 500 times over! r'Bear beamed.  
I should be giving out cigars!

Daddy r'Bear told this reporter he was lucky to find some of 
the species in breeding pairs.

It's hard to find some of these little guys.  For example, the 
Green Dragonbird is really, really rare!

The Green Dragonbird is much like a blue Peacock, but the tail 
sports an iridescent greenish hue.  Other species added to his 
collection are New Guinea Singing Dogs, Amur Tigers, Somali Ostriches, 
Short-tailed Chinchillas and two Northeast Congo lions.

I've got an in with a local goat farmer, r'Bear told us, I 
don't want Pookey, that's the male lion, eating any of my Cuvier's 
Gazelle.

r'Bear plans to have a week-long open house once the animals are 
settled.

WASHINGTON - Food and consumer groups handed mediocre grades to the
Agriculture Department in a "report card" Tuesday on its handling of mad
cow disease.

Groups such as Center for Food Safety, Consumers Union and the
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation gave no "A's" and only one "B" -
for a new policy prohibiting non-ambulatory animals from use in food and
feed - out of 10 categories. There was one "C" for initial steps to
better identify and track cattle nationally.

Six "D's" were given in the areas of: testing cattle 20 months or older;
ensuring feed restrictions; increasing surveillance for variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease;
strengthening authority to recall tainted meat; implementing use of
country of origin labels; and allowing for public input.

The groups, which also included Friends of the Earth, Government
Accountability Project, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy
Action and Public Citizen, said the administration deserved two failing
grades.

There was a time when vegetarians and other healthconscious eaters were
forced to carry coolers loaded with food from home when they traveled
almost anywhere in the United States. But the world has changed, and
anyone who has driven the interstate lately knows that even there, one
can nearly always find something reasonably nutritious and satisfying to
eat.

McDonald's and other fastfood establishments include a variety of salad
meals and sandwiches that are lower in fat and calories than their main
selections, but still filling and rich in flavor.
...
Even those who want to dine and shop vegetarian and organic on the road
now have choices. A new paperback guide, "Healthy Highways: The
Traveler's Guide to Healthy Eating," by Nikki and David Goldbeck, the
authors of "The Supermarket Handbook" and "American Wholefoods Cuisine,"
is a good companion as you make your way across the 48 and even up to
Alaska or across the sea to Hawaii.

One of the Goldbecks' goals is to encourage existing restaurants to
provide a broader range of menu items, including vegetarian options. For
example, in various cities in California, where many healthful food
trends originate, there is a chain of family restaurants, Hobee's, that
caters to nearly every taste, from bacon and fries to tofu and brown
rice, the authors write. For those seeking more healthful fare, Hobee's
selections include whole-wheat pancakes, homemade and mostly vegetarian
soups, veggie and turkey burgers and even soy milk.

Scoop
Greenpeace MV Esperanza arrived in Icelandic whaling center, Isafjordur 
Isafjordur 22 June 2004 - "Choose the future, not whaling", was the message 
communicated when the Greenpeace ship, MV Esperanza arrived at the port of 
Isafjordur, the number one Icelandic whaling center. The port visit is the first 
stop in this year's shiptour in Iceland. During the day Greenpeace will meet 
with locals communities, whalers and fishermen to discuss the future of whaling 
in Iceland. 
The Icelandic government recently announced that they will put their so 
called "scientific" whaling programme on hold and limit this year's take to 25 
minke whales. The planned take of 500 whales, including sei and fin, during a 2 
year period, has been cancelled due to a strong domestic criticism combined with 
the lack of a market for whale products. 
A total of 36 minke whales were caught last year when Iceland, despite 
massive global protests, resumed whaling again for the first time in 14 years. (1) 
"Iceland is on the border between old and new, future and past", said 
Greenpeace International Ocean Campaigner, Frode Pleym. "The Government of Iceland 
should make the obvious wise decision and cancel the entire programme. By 
choosing the only truly sustainable future path, Iceland can set an example for 
other whaling nations to follow and secure a future for the people of this 
country". 
The market for whale meat is small and decreasing in whaling nations Iceland, 
Norway and Japan due to changed eating habits and the level of environmental 
toxins in the whale products. Iceland still has an ample supply of whale meat 
left over since last year's take and no future market is in sight. 
The growing domestic opposition to whaling came as a surprise to the 
Government. The Icelandic travel industry association and the whale watching operators 
have made it clear that a restart of whaling in Iceland will damage the 
reputation of the nation and decrease the amount of tourists visiting. Tourism and 
whale watching has become one of the major sources of income in Iceland. 
"Early indications are that eco tourism- and whale watching in particular- , 
is already suffering because of whaling, said Frode Pleym."

MIGALOO the white humpback has been declared a whale of special interest to 
ensure safe passage during his annual migration through Queensland waters.

The declaration took effect yesterday. 
"The declaration of special interest means there will be specific viewing 
conditions relating to Migaloo," Environment Minister John Mickel said. 
"People will not be able to drive a boat or jet ski any closer than 500m to 
the whale or fly an aircraft any closer than 2000 feet (610m) without written 
permission. 
"The maximum fine for breaching these conditions is $12, 375." 
Mr Mickel said the Environmental Protection Agency would continue to maintain 
a database of sightings of Migaloo that was set up during the whale's visit 
last year. 
Mr Mickel said Migaloo was injured in a collision with a trimaran off 
Magnetic Island last year and he urged boaties to take care during the whale 
migration season because there was a higher chance of boat strikes. 
Humpback whales are listed as vulnerable in Queensland under the Nature 
Conservation Act. 
All whales and dolphins are protected under the Act.

The Royal New Zealand SPCA has praised the speedy trial and sentencing of a 
Nelson man found guilty of beating his dog on the head with a hammer. 
The Nelson District Court yesterday sentenced Adam John May (30) to 250 hours 
Community Service and banned him from owning animals for five years. May was 
also ordered to pay $428 to the SPCA's Nelson branch at the rate of $10 per 
week, to cover veterinary expenses. 
The injured dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Chopper, has been 
forfeited to the SPCA . 
"This was a cruel and vicious attack on poor Chopper, who suffered soft- 
tissue injuries to his skull, fractured teeth and jaw injuries. There can be no 
excuses for this kind of wanton cruelty," says the Royal New Zealand SPCA's 
Acting Chief Executive, Jenny Prattley. 
Mrs Prattley notes that the sentence comes less than two weeks after the New 
Plymouth District Court sentenced a woman to 300 hours Community Service and 
ordered her to pay $4,000 in reparations to the SPCA after she was found guilty 
of failing to care adequately for 21 Persian cats. 
"Taken together, these two cases suggest that our courts are starting to take 
a tougher line with people who are cruel or callous in their treatment of 
animals. It should be borne in mind that these are still far from draconian 
sentences when compared to those allowed for by the 1999 Animal Welfare Act. For 
example, in Chopper's case, his former owner could have faced a fine of $25,000 
and/or six months in prison.

Two weeks after a mysterious substance killed three of his dairy cows
and sickened seven others, John Koopman has a growing lagoon on the back
acres of his Enumclaw farm, filled not with crisp blue water but with
thousands of gallons of raw milk.
...
Patrick Adams, the special agent in charge of the Seattle office of the
FBI, said evidence gathered so far does not indicate any obvious tie to
domestic or international terrorism.
...
In early May, before the compromise was reached, vandals opened the
valves on two tankers that were hauling raw milk for WestFarm. Almost
120,000 pounds of milk were lost. The vandals also punctured the tires
on the tanker trucks.
...
He is more inclined to believe it was the work of a group like the Earth
Liberation Front, or ELF, an extremist group that targets what it sees
as environmental destruction. The federal government sent out a
nationwide alert earlier this month to warn farmers and other groups
that ELF may be planning attacks.

A few miles from Koopman's farm, three signs advertising land for sale
were vandalized recently. The vandals spray-painted over the real-estate
agent's name and phone number, and on one sign included the tag "ELF."

POLICE are investigating an animal rights activist group after
shareholders in Montpellier, the construction group building a new drugs
research laboratory for Oxford University, received threatening letters
in the post. Shares in Montpellier crashed by 19 per cent yesterday
after investors received a letter ? purporting to be from Roy Harrison,
the company?s chairman ? threatening ?prompt activity by the animal
rights movement? unless they sold their shares. The stock ended the day
at a four-year low of 18p, down 4?p.

The letter is aimed at derailing a new ?18 million animal testing
laboratory which Montpellier is building for Oxford University. Walter
Lilly &amp; Co, a subsidiary of the group, is leading the project, and
activists are hoping to force the company to pull out by targeting
shareholders of the group. 
...
It is not known exactly who is behind the campaign. Speak, a prominent
representative body for animal activists, did not return phone calls
yesterday.

The activists will be hoping to replicate the success of SHAC, the Stop
Huntingdon Animal Cruelty organisation, which helped to push Huntingdon
Life Sciences, the Cambridge-based drug testing company, to the brink of
collapse. In January 2000 SHAC began a campaign which targeted the
company and its financial backers, including shareholders, bankers and
City institutions such as market makers and stockbrokers. The company?s
share price, which was 22p at the start of 2000, quickly fell by about
65 per cent and continued to fall for the next two years, to stand at
3.25p at the end of 2001, when the company moved to the US and relisted
in New York.

Lori Lehner, who played a central role in the infamous "Silver Spring
monkeys" case when she opened her house to 17 laboratory monkeys in
1981, died of leukemia June 2 in Tampa. She was 45 and had lived in
Florida since 1997.

By outfitting her basement in Rockville as a temporary refuge for the
monkeys, Ms. Lehner helped set in motion the celebrated case, which led
to a decade of legal and scientific wrangling and propelled the newly
formed People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals into the most
powerful and controversial group in the animal rights movement.

Ms. Lehner had studied to be an actress, but she found herself on an
especially bright public stage when Montgomery County police raided a
Silver Spring laboratory on Sept. 11, 1981, and seized 17 monkeys from
the Institute for Behavioral Research.

        <docText>MicroIslet, Inc. (Amex: MII)
today announced a collaboration with the University of California, Davis
(UC Davis) in the area of islet cell transplantation therapies for treatment
of insulin-dependent diabetes.  Under the terms of the agreement, MicroIslet
and the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis plan to
conduct non-human primate studies utilizing MicroIslet's proprietary
technologies for preparation and encapsulation of pig islets.  MicroIslet
believes the completion of the studies at UC Davis will set the stage for an
Investigational New Drug application (IND) and that the data from these
studies will be included as part of the IND for human clinical trials.  The
project at UC Davis will be conducted in parallel with MicroIslet's ongoing
collaboration with Dr. Daniel Salomon of The Scripps Research Institute in La
Jolla, California.

The battle is on to try and rid Denver of a decades-old tradition. 
 
Officials from the National Humane Society met with local advocates Wednesday 
morning at the City and County building to kick off a campaign to drive 
support for a ballot initiative to ban all circuses which use exotic animals from 
pitching their tents in Denver. 
A 15-year-old launched the ballot initiative. Heather Herman hopes voters 
will get behind her cause as much as fellow advocates. She believes these types 
of circuses abuse animals.
"It has been a great honor to be a part of these wonderful exciting steps 
that we have taken to expand our kindness as humans to help animals," said 
Herman. "It's not natural when you got elephants standing on each other and tigers 
jumping through fiery hoops." 
Herman and other activists collected 6,000 signatures to get the issue on the 
ballot for the Aug. 10 primaries. The campaign officially began Wednesday, 
with supporters canvassing neighborhoods to inform people about the proposal. 
However, circuses have a number of supporters in Denver and major circuses 
like the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus say they do not mistreat 
their animals.

        <docText>Popular low-carbohydrate diets are leading Americans 
to poor health and spawning a rip-off industry of "carb-friendly" products, 
health experts and consumer advocates have said.

They announced a new group, called the Partnership for Essential Nutrition, 
to help educate Americans about the need for healthy carbohydrates such as 
vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains.

"When unproven science becomes a sales pitch, some people get rich and the 
rest of us get ripped off," Jeffrey Prince of the American Institute for 
Cancer Research told a news conference.

"Eating vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans, which are all 
predominantly carbohydrate, is linked to a reduced risk of cancer, heart 
disease, stroke, diabetes and a range of other chronic diseases."

Prince said low-carb diets that advocate piling on the animal protein and 
fat are "increasing the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, stroke, 
type-2 diabetes and other chronic diseases".

The new group includes such organizations as the Alliance for Aging 
Research, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the AICR and the 
American Obesity Association.

Animal rightists lose sponsor ? After massive complaints from hunters and 
anglers, the pet food company Iams has ended a relationship with an anti-hunting 
animal rights organization. 
    In January, hunter advocate U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance alerted outdoorsmen 
that the Iams Co., maker of Iams and Eukanuba pet foods, joined forces with 
the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) as grand national sponsor of the 
Pet Fest America tour. The tour is a series of animal shows developed by 
HSUS. A flood of sportsmen's calls, faxes and letters ensued, and in the end, 
Iams, a division of Proctor and Gamble, discontinued its support of the 
anti-hunters. 
    Iams conceded the feedback it received from sportsmen had a great deal to 
do with its decision to cut ties with the HSUS. 
    "[We] apologize for the frustration that this sponsorship has caused," 
the company wrote in a letter addressed to the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance. 
    According to the sportsmen's group, some of the nation's major consumer 
product and service firms, including General Mills, Accor Economy Lodging, 
Sears and Ace Hardware, ended relationships with HSUS after thousands of sportsmen 
levied strong protests.

Long before supermarkets devoted aisle space to organic produce, tofu
and free-range chicken, there was the George Street Co-op in New
Brunswick.

Started in 1973 by members of the Vegetarian Club at Rutgers College,
the co-op has survived three decades, filling a niche for consumers
seeking healthy alternatives. 

But now that organic food has gone mainstream, the co-op is struggling
to find its place.

"You can buy natural foods in every regular supermarket," said Bill
Zietlow, the co-op's general manager.

Here's a joke: Why did the vegan cross the road? Because the chicken was
about to beat him up.

Why did the butter-loving baker cross the road? Because the vegan cakes,
tarts and cookies were so good. No joke.

Thanks to cutting-edge pastry chefs with classical training, vegan
baking -- baking without animal products or refined sugars -- is now not
only good for you, but good tasting.

That's right -- adios, adobe cookies. Sayonara, straw cakes. Later on,
Uncle Manny's Whole-Wheat Hippie Brownies. Say hello to silken tofu pie,
bee-friendly baklava and custards without an egg in sight.

While you'll be hard-pressed to find all-vegan patisseries in your
neighborhood, there are a number of wholesale bakeries from Oakland to
Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa to Sacramento whose vegan baked goods are
available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Wild Oats and Rainbow Grocery,
as well as at some coffee houses.
...
Why vegan?

People adopt vegan diets for health concerns and ethical consciousness.
Some people are allergic to dairy. Others can't stomach the thought of
eating animal-based products -- not just meat, butter, eggs or milk, but
white granulated sugar that may be processed using carbonized animal
bones; gelatin that's derived from cows, pigs or fish, and even honey
since it's produced by bees.

For bakers, producing tasty treats without the holy trinity of butter,
eggs or milk products is a challenge. Each of those ingredients plays
its own special role in structure, flavor and mouthfeel.
...
But Pearce, Costigan, Sibar and other vegan bakers certainly try -- and
succeed with appetizing results. Tofu and ground flax seeds substitute
for eggs' structural qualities. Some bakers use commercial stand-ins
such as Ener-G Egg Replacer, which includes a combination of tapioca and
potato flours. Fats such as canola oil and palm oil replace butter's
richness. While they lack the creaminess of cow's milk, soy, rice and
coconut milk are adequate substitutes. Natural products such as maple
sugar, evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup and barley syrup provide
sweetness, tenderness and help extend shelf life. Unlike processed white
or brown sugars, which have no nutritive value, natural sweeteners
retain some fibers and nutrients.

TALLAHASSEE - Advocates of greater protection for manatees were unsuccessful 
in blocking a high-speed boat race this weekend off St. Petersburg that they 
say poses significant risks for the endangered mammals. 
The U.S. Coast Guard issued a permit for the race this week to Offshore Super 
Series Inc., a nonprofit group headed by St. Petersburg businessman and 
powerboat racer Todd Werner. About 40 boats that reach 130 mph will race around a 4 
1/2- mile course. 
The race has been planned for months, but the Coast Guard withheld the permit 
until Monday after race officials agreed to manatee protection suggestions 
made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These included moving the race 
course from a quarter- mile off shore to a half-mile and moving an area for boating 
spectators on the side away from shore. 
Race officials also agreed to put a manatee spotter in the air. Teams of 
boaters will be looking for any animals that swim into the race area as well.

A Florida panther spent weeks feasting on easy prey at an Everglades petting 
zoo, leading a local resident to set up a video camera and film the panther 
attacking a tethered goat. Now he is under investigation for possible violation 
of wildlife laws.

It is the latest fight over panthers, people and the value of wilderness, as 
a growing population of panthers tries to survive among the Miccosukee 
villages, housing developments and tourist attractions of the western Everglades.
The panther began killing animals about three weeks ago at the petting zoo at 
Trail Lakes Campground, a few miles northeast of Everglades City. Drawn by 
tame animals grazing just an easy hop over a low fence, the panther killed 16 
goats, four emus, five ducks, three turkeys and a chicken, said the owner, Jack 
Shealy. A biologist from the National Park Service confirmed that a panther 
was responsible.

With Shealy's permission, Jan Michael Jacobson, director of the Everglades 
Institute, which is critical of federal wildlife policy, set up a video camera 
above a tethered goat.

The panther came that night. The attack lasted longer than he expected, said 
Jacobson, who lives nearby at Big Cypress National Preserve. The panther 
mauled the goat slowly, apparently accustomed to killing tethered animals.

An Internet story has been sent out to many pet breed memberships and
animal support group Web sites and mailing lists concerning the Swiffer
Wetjet.

The story alleges that the Swiffer Wetjet contains harmful chemicals
that can kill a pet due to liver failure. I have received telephone
calls, letters and e-mails as to whether the story is true. The answer
is no.
...
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
weighed in on the issue, and is working with the parent company Proctor
and Gamble to dispel the e-mail's unfounded allegation. According to the
ASPCA's Animal Poison Control Center, the Swiffer WetJet System contains
water (90-100 percent), propylene glycol n-propyl ether and isopropyl
alcohol (1-4 percent).

Michigan's first dove season in 100 years is only three months away, and
one of the architects of the law that allowed dove hunting has drawn
fire from some hunters. They say the hunt should not have been limited
to six counties in southernmost Michigan.
...
Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed the dove bill into law last Friday. It
allows mourning dove hunting in six counties that border Indiana and
Ohio, states that already have dove hunting (as does Wisconsin, which
borders the western Upper Peninsula).

Lulu and Tinkerbelle, the last two elephants at the San Francisco Zoo,
will remain California girls -- they'll be moving to a sanctuary in
Calaveras County rather than packing up for Tennessee.

It's only a question of when.

"We go on elephant time now. You'd have to talk to Tinkerbelle and
Lulu," Pat Derby, who runs the Performing Animal Welfare Society's
2,300-acre refuge in San Andreas, said Wednesday.

The zoo's decision was easy: The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tenn.,
withdrew as a contender. Founder Carol Buckley was worried about Asian
elephant Tinkerbelle making a 2,292-mile trip, and the presence of
African elephant Lulu would have made life difficult for a new arrival
named Flora.

DOLGEVILLE - Two more arrests were made Tuesday in connection with what
looks like a graduation prank that went too far at Dolgeville High
School.

On the early morning of June 15, a Dolgeville village police officer
checked on the high school and found a number of dead animals about the
grounds. A decaying deer carcass had been dumped in front of the
school's main entrance and two freshly killed cats hung from the high
school marquee and a "Do Not Enter" sign on the property. A second deer
carcass hung from a school fence. Eggs had been thrown at the school and
fish organs along with a dead frog were found on the marquee. There was
vulgar language directed at a faculty member spray painted on the
sidewalk.
 
It appears the act of vandalism was a graduation prank that got out of
hand.
...
Under 1999's "Buster's Law," also known as the Felony Animal Cruelty
Act, aggravated cruelty to domestic animals, such as killing two cats
and hanging them on display, is a felony offense punishable by up to two
years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

Douglas County officials expressed disappointment Wednesday with the outcome 
of Bob Stirton's trial on 31 counts of animal neglect.

Commissioners and other officials were pleased with Stirton's conviction 
Tuesday on all 31 criminal accounts. However, they weren't happy that, for at 
least the time being, Stirton will be allowed to maintain ownership of the dogs 
being cared for at the Saving Grace Pet Adoption Center in Winchester.

"We knew we probably weren't going to get much money out of him, but we 
wanted a forfeiture order so we could make arrangements for those dogs to be 
adopted," Commissioner Dan Van Slyke said.

The county is providing the nonprofit shelter an additional $3,000 a month to 
care for the 30 dogs in its custody. That amounts to a little more than $3 a 
day per animal. The dogs, along with another one that died in March, have 
remained at the shelter on Del Rio Road since Dec. 23.

The expense for the dogs belonging to Stirton, who had resided in the Drain 
and Curtin areas but who now lives in Cottage Grove, is in addition to the 
regular $5,500 monthly subsidy provided to Saving Grace for the entire shelter 
operation. The cost of caring for Stirton's dogs represents more than half of the 
normal subsidy.

Senate Democrats on Wednesday charged the Agriculture Department with
introducing mad cow contamination to the United States last year by
quietly relaxing a blanket import ban. The ban had been imposed after
the first case of the brain-wasting disease was discovered in Alberta in
May 2003.

Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, along with Sens.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Mark Dayton, D-Minn., asked Phyllis Fong, the
USDA inspector general, to investigate what they called "breaches of
public trust" created by changing procedures in a way that could have
resulted in contaminated meat entering the United States.

An Agriculture Department spokeswoman said the imported meat met new and
more stringent regulations Canada imposed after the discovery of the
case. The second case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow
disease, in North America was diagnosed in a Washington state cow last
December.

In response to a court suit brought by the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action
Legal Fund, the USDA last month admitted that Agriculture Secretary Ann
Veneman relaxed a prohibition against Canadian imports in August to
permit some processed beef products to be sent to American plants.

Tuesday morning I had the honor to have breakfast with Kayne Robinson,
the president of the National Rifle Association. It wasn't that we were
seated across the table from each other, but rather, we were in the same
room with about 500 fellow members of the Outdoor Writers Association of
America in Spokane.
...
According to Robinson, Free Hunters will bring hunting back into the
main stream of American life; will work to get more states to adopt
hunters' bill of rights and right to hunt constitutional amendments;
support game and habitat perpetuation; protect the rights of hunters and
their interests through legislation, administrative and legal action;
secure more hunting lands and places for practice; will form alliances
with others to fight animal rights and eco-terrorists that are working
to ban hunting and access to hunting lands.

Dr Reddin outlined an ongoing feral cat control programme under his 
leadership.

There will be a more public direction, notably, the expansion of the well 
received website www.kangaroo-island-world.com/cats/catnews which was set up by 
local Mr Mal Ellson.

Dr Reddin spoke of KICCC's successful liaison with government agencies which 
have supported a public education 'Responsible Cat Ownership' stand at the 
Kingscote Agricultural Show in 2003, scientific research and funding of on-ground 
control measures.

He also mentioned toxoplasmosis-related human reproductive problems, and the 
need to maintain epidemiological surveillance.

The trapping sub-committee, led by Mr Barry Green, tabled numbers of 144 
feral cat control events, from which nearly 50 feral cats have been analysed for 
toxoplasmosis titres which have shown an alarming rate of more than 90% 
positive result.

He acknowledged and thanked the observation and reporting of over 22 
individual contributors to the tally.

The committee is aware of many anecdotal feral cat control events, and in 
keeping with required scientific vigour, has begun collecting and collating basic 
information from these cat control events.

KICCC would welcome your contribution.

Guest speaker, Mr Michael Johnson, a Victorian scientist, described the 
arduous development of a combination of chemicals to formulate a humane, felid 
specific toxicant, with an illustrated talk of his work on fax-free, feral 
cat-infested French Island.

There is still some way to go, but a liquid toxin in a hard pellet has proved 
most successful for feral cat control.

SYDNEY Scientists have long studied haunting whale songs, but now 
they are investigating what the whales make of ocean noises to determine 
whether freighters, military sonars and oil drilling are harming the giant 
mammals. 
"We actually know very little about the way whales perceive sound and use 
sound," said Michael Noad, the scientist at the University of Queensland who 
heads the U.S.-navy funded study. 
Scientists and green groups have voiced concern over the impact on whales and 
other sea mammals of sounds generated by shipping, the military and oil rigs, 
Noad said Friday. 
U.S. officials linked a mass stranding and the death of several whale species 
in the Bahamas in March 2000 to the use of a navy mid-frequency sonar system. 
The Australian study is being funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and 
is focusing on the meaning of whale songs and how whales react to other 
noises. 
The study is taking place off Peregian Beach of Australia's tropical eastern 
state Queensland, in a "commercial shipping highway" used by migrating 
humpback whales.

The city has not had a ?leopard problem? for over 100 years. But in the past 
five or six years, attacks have increased. Short and long-term steps must be 
taken instantly to eliminate the problem. 
Main reasons for human-wild animal conflict at the Sanjay Gandhi National 
Park, Borivali:Increasing human settlements have come up inside and adjacent to 
the national park.
Disturbance by humans inside the forest, which leads to a drop in the 
population of prey such as wild boar, sambar, chital, barking deer, monkeys, 
blacknaped hares, squirrels and ground birds.
Dumping of organic garbage by residents of skyscrapers and slums. This 
attracts animals and leads to the proliferation of stray dogs, which causes leopards 
to leave the forest in search of easy food. 


Short-term steps to reduce the human-wild animal conflict:
A dusk-to-dawn curfew for kids. No lone pedestrians at vulnerable points at 
any time of day.
Night watch by rotation by security guards or by elders equipped with with 
fire crackers and hooters, drums, etc. In make-shift dwellings, ??noise makers
???bells, cans, rattles?should be placed on doors and fences to startle cats.
Lights (can run on solar energy) at vulnerable points.

KFC has dropped previously announced plans to place restaurants in
Tibet, but the decision was unrelated to a letter from the Dalai Lama
saying the "corporation's support for cruelty and mass slaughter violate
Tibetan value."
...
Michael McGraw, spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, said the organization "would be thrilled" if KFC has changed
its plan. However, "it's our understanding that they do intend to expand
into Tibet and elsewhere in Asia," he said.

In the Dalai Lama's letter, as presented by PETA, the Buddhist leader
said he decided to become a vegetarian after seeing the slaughter of a
chicken in 1965. 

"Tibetans are not, as a rule, vegetarians," he wrote, because vegetables
in the province of China are often scarce and meat forms a large part of
the diet. "However, it was considered more ethical to eat the meat of
larger animals such as yaks than small ones, because fewer large animals
would have to be killed."

Confirmation of the letter's authenticity was not immediately available.
The New York branch of the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai
Lama, said yesterday that verification would have to come from India,
where the main office was closed for the day.

Two Billings television stations have pulled advertisements by the
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that showed graphic images
of animal processing and a message advocating vegetarianism.

Officials from the Montana Stockgrowers Association met with managers at
KSVI (ABC) and KHMT (Fox) on Wednesday to protest the commercial's
images and messages, said Tamara Beardsley, communications coordinator
for stock growers group.

"We requested they take them off the air because of the fact that they
are misleading," Beardsley said Thursday. "We thought it was our job to
let them know these advertisements were not accurate."

The ads - part of PETA's "Go Vegetarian" campaign - were scheduled to
run more than 250 times starting Monday until July 18. The ads ran
several times this week before being taken off the air.

There are some hip-hop artists who don't drink Tanqueray and Aliz? and
want no part of the late-night trips to the BK.

Take the socially conscious rap duo Dead Prez, whose song "Be Healthy"
includes the lyrics: "I don't eat meat, no dairy, no sweets ? only ripe
vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat." 
...
Singer Erykah Badu, an active promoter of the vegan lifestyle, has been
known to stop by Seattle's Hillside Quickies Vegan Sandwich Shop, where
the Howell family serves up Tempehstrami Subs and Macaroni and Yease to
the tune of hip-hop, dance hall and reggae.

"We get a lot of artists that come through here," said Ayinde Howell, a
25-year-old vegan and local rapper/poet, "the ones who take care of
their bodies." 
...
At the forefront is rap mogul and entrepreneur Russell Simmons, a strict
vegan who is active in People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Simmons has, among other things, signed on to PETA's anti-fur ad in
Women's Wear Daily, recorded a radio public service announcement
promoting vegetarianism and participated in the PETA Celebrity Cookbook.

At 2 a.m., all bears look big, especially one that is walking down your 
hallway or looking in the front window.

I've never had one in my house, but I've dealt with plenty of bears in the 
early morning hours, and I've taken plenty of calls from those people that have 
had them inside their homes. 

The one common denominator is that the bear always weighs "at least 900 
pounds."

In actuality, most bears in Nevada are about one-third that size, the average 
is 300 pounds for adult males and 150 pounds for adult females. 

The bear's size depends in part on what they are eating, which is the whole 
reason this issue is being discussed. 

Those bears that primarily eat garbage and other foods made available by 
humans and are considerably larger than the typical "wild" bear. 

Garbage fed bears gain weight very easily and can weigh almost double what 
they would if they were eating natural type foods, mainly vegetation. 

Black bears (the only species of bear in Nevada or California) are omnivores, 
meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. 

A black bear's diet is 85 percent vegetation, consisting of grasses, shrubs, 
flowers, berries and nuts. 

They will also eat insects of all kinds, small mammals and carrion. 

They are not supposed to be eating human garbage.

There are two common misconceptions surrounding the bears in the Tahoe Basin. 

First, that the bear population is growing, mainly because people see them 
more often. 

Second, that the bears are in the urban areas because they are starving, and 
therefore must be fed. 

Both assumptions are wrong, yet understandable to a certain degree.

A recent study by both the University of Nevada, Reno and the Nevada 
Department of Wildlife concluded that the black bear population in Nevada is stable, 
at about 150-250 animals.

This number has not changed significantly over the last 20 years. 

What has changed is the number of bears that are concentrated in and around 
the urban areas, such as Incline Village, Cave Rock, Zephyr Cove and Stateline. 

The density of bears in these urban pockets is one of the highest 
ever-recorded in North America, and is directly related to the availability of human 
garbage.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in the doghouse with
animal-welfare advocates for proposing that shelters be allowed to kill
stray animals more quickly to save money, said Friday that his budget
recommendation was a mistake.

As part of his budget proposal first drafted in December, the governor
had asked the Legislature to repeal a 1998 law that requires the
shelters to hold dogs and cats up to six days before destroying them.
The governor wanted to save local goverments that operate the shelters
$14 million by cutting the waiting period in half.

But after a nationwide storm of protest, the governor organized a press
conference outside his Capitol office and confessed to his error.

WASHINGTON - An animal in the United States tested positive in a
preliminary screening test for mad cow disease, Agriculture Department
officials said Friday.

John Clifford, deputy administrator of USDA veterinary services, said
officials learned of the "inconclusive" test result at 5:30 p.m. Friday.
The carcass is being sent to USDA National Veterinary Laboratory in
Ames, Iowa, for additional tests. Results are expected in 4 to 7 days.

Clifford declined to identify the animal or its location until testing
is complete, noting that it's "very likely" final testing could turn up
negative.

"The animal in question didn't enter the food chain," he said. "If
positive, we'll provide additional information on the animal and
origins."

For more than 20 years, one scientist has
ignored the conventional thinking among researchers that mad cow disease
and similar disorders are caused by abnormal proteins and instead has
pursued an alternative view that the culprit is a tiny, rare bacteria.

Dr. Frank Bastian, a pathologist at Tulane University in New Orleans,
has encountered controversy over the years and seen his hypothesis
roundly dismissed by nearly all other researchers working in this field.
Nevertheless, he has stubbornly persisted in collecting data to support
his hypothesis.

Now, Bastian may have uncovered the first molecular evidence of a link
between chronic wasting disease -- a mad-cow-like illness that afflicts
deer -- and scrapie, the sheep equivalent.

The finding, which has not been corroborated, could help answer the
long-standing question of the origin of chronic wasting disease, which
seemed to have come out of nowhere in the 1960s and has been spreading
ever since across deer and elk herds in the midwestern United States and
into Canada.

An animal-rights group sued the state Attorney General's Office
yesterday, accusing it of violating public records laws by refusing to
release some documents about the slaughter of cows at one of the state's
largest meatpacking plants.

In a lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court, the Humane Farming
Association alleged state officials withheld information from their
investigation into the association's complaint about the meatpacking
plant.

The organization, based in San Rafael, Calif., complained in 2000 that
cows were being strung up and processed alive at the IBP plant in
Wallula, now operated by Tyson Fresh Meats.

LANESBORO -- The Cole Bros. Circus is coming to the Berkshire Mall this
weekend, and with it could come animal rights protesters angry about the
troupe's use of animals in its shows.

Earlier this week, during a WNAW radio interview with a Lions Club
member, a caller announced she would be protesting the circus. She said
that the use of animals in the show was cruel and unnecessary.

The circus is sponsored by the Dalton Lions Club.

Protesters gathered at a Cole Bros. show last weekend at Thomas J. Dodd
Stadium in Norwich, Conn. "Stop animal abuse," read one sign carried by
demonstrators.

Any circus protesters that show up at this weekend's three-ring show
would not be a surprise to Cole Bros. marketing director Mario Vitali.

Poor, beleaguered fast-food companies. Do they ever get any respect?
Books such as Fast Food Nation and the film Super Size Me have recently
offered scathing depictions of McDonald's, Wendy's and other giant
burger chains, blaming them for everything from low minimum-wage laws to
an international obesity epidemic. When the British government announced
this month that it was considering a "Big Mac sin tax" to fund anti-fat
initiatives, observers took it as one more sign that Big Food is
replacing Big Tobacco as corporate enemy No. 1.

But now Burger King -- second only to McDonald's in buns and patties
served -- has found enthusiastic supporters of an unlikely sort:
animal-rights activists.

Since Burger King launched a meat-free hamburger across North America,
vegans -- vegetarians who are so strict they also eschew eggs and dairy
products -- have been returning to burger culture with the same militant
zeal that once drove them to flee. In a strange irony, vegan websites
now donate free advertising to the chain, shower the company with awards
and record the praise of vegans who do cartwheels at the mere mention of
Burger King's name (albeit cartwheels of a delicate and careful sort, so
as not to accidentally harm any small creatures).

If "Burger King veganism" has an intellectual headquarters, it is
Vegan.com, an Internet news site that is the vegan equivalent of CNN.
The site's homepage features the chain's corporate logo -- amid links to
articles about mad-cow disease and ads for vegan cookbooks -- which
appears above the words, "Support it or lose it!" Four accompanying
articles and an eight-minute audio file urge vegans to head on down to
the home of the Whopper.

"When I found out that the BK Veggie was being established, I was pretty
excited," says Eric Marcus, the 37-year-old journalist and author who
operates Vegan.com from Ithaca, N.Y. Since 2002, Burger King has sold
its "meatless alternative" sandwich at all of its 8,000 stores in the
United States, a distinct contrast to rival chains such as McDonald's,
which offers its McVeggie Burger only at scattered U.S. outlets. (In
Canada, both chains provide veggie burgers nationwide.)

Teens Jad Carson and Barry Gessner haven?t met a duck, ostrich, fish,
cow or pig they didn?t like ? to eat.

Should they feel shame about that as students at traditionally liberal
George School in Middletown? No, they say.

But the many pro-vegetarian, anti-meat-eating posters, Tshirts, stickers
and classmates at their school made them feel their meat-laden meals
were bad ? immoral even.
...
They formed a carnivorefriendly club called MEAT (Mammals Eating Animals
Today).

The club sparked lively debates between meat-eaters and vegetarians
across the campus when it started in January.

Their weekly meetings ? the guys call them ?meatings? ? became popular
and attracted as many as 27 students.
...
Jeannie McStay of the Baltimore-based Vegetarian Resource Group, a
national nonprofit group that supports and provides information on
vegetarianism, said people today are more aware of meat-free food
options and the animal rights group PETA (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals) has raised awareness of animal cruelty issues.

?More and more teens are made aware of what it took to get that meat on
their plate,? McStay said. ?The cruelty issue made me become vegetarian.
I grant it, health is a great benefit.?

What about Jad and Barry and other committed meat lovers? McStay had
this to say, ?I think if they visited a slaughterhouse or an industrial
farm they?d feel differently.?

Jad and Barry said they know about the slaughterhouses and industrial
farms. They?ve seen videos from PETA about animal cruelty.

?It is disturbing, but you can go free range,? Barry said.

Jad added, ?It?s better for the animals plus it tastes better.?

Sacramento -- Strange things happen when stray animals fall into the
churning wheels of a state struggling to save a few bucks here and
there.

Dogs begin showing up at the Capitol. The seldom-seen wrath of the
California Potbellied Pig Association is aroused. And by the end of the
day, the state's most powerful man pauses, pivots and restores calm to
the land.

An overlooked cash-saving component of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's
proposed 2004-05 budget would have shortened the length of time dogs and
cats are kept alive at shelters. It also would have allowed the shelters
to destroy immediately what the state apparently feels are lesser pets:
hamsters, rabbits, turtles and even potbellied pigs.

Horrified animal-rights activists caught wind of the plan and mobilized
this week.

"I realized last night," Schwarzenegger said at a hastily called news
conference outside his office Friday, "that there was a mistake I made." 
...
"I'm writing a letter right now," said Jim Christensen, who with his
wife, Marcie, works to rescue abandoned pet pigs from Bay Area shelters.
The animals became popular in the early 1990s; the Christensens have two
of them.

"Animals are always secondary," Marcie sighed, reflecting on the state
budget. Schwarzenegger, she felt, was "looking to make a quick buck."

She envisioned a harsher life in this new, belt-tightened California.

"I know of some shelters right now that, if they are allowed to kill it
when it comes in, they probably will," she said. "The pool guy comes and
leaves the gate open, and the pig gets out. What if their bunny gets
out? What if their bird gets out?"

On it went. Animal shelters, too, tried to figure out what to do if the
Hayden Act came crashing down.

Sheri Cardo, public relations director of the Marin Humane Society,
thought shelters would try to continue to operate under its provisions,
even after a repeal. She noted that the Bay Area had long been a leader
in promoting "no-kill" policies for stray and relinquished animals.

Pet lovers and animal rights  activists today were organizing against Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposal to  repeal a law requiring animal shelters to 
hold stray cats and dogs up to six  days before killing them.

Opponents of the proposal staged a small  afternoon protest with about a 
dozen dogs at the state Capitol and flooded the  governor's office with faxes and 
phone calls.

Pamelyn Ferdin,  spokesperson for the Animal Defense League of Los Angeles, 
spent today  organizing the group's 3,000 members and working with other 
organizations to  plan a statewide protest this weekend.

"The entire humane community is  organizing," said Ferdin, whose organization 
describes itself as a "militant,  grass-roots, animal rights" group. 
"Wherever [Schwarzenegger] goes to speak,  we'll be outside with photos showing dead 
animals, animals being dragged to the  kill room."

As a favor to the state's cash-poor counties and cities,  Schwarzenegger has 
asked the state Legislature to reverse the 1998 law, which  makes adoption of 
wayward pets the first priority of shelters instead of quickly  putting them 
to death. The law is dubbed the Hayden Act, after former Santa  Monica state 
senator and activist Tom Hayden.

"This is an issue that  affects the care and protection of tens of thousands 
of stray animals, and will  inflict heartbreak on a lot of owners and people 
in the animal adoption world,"  Hayden said Thursday.

The governor proposes a change in the law to allow  birds, hamsters, 
potbellied pigs, rabbits, snakes, turtles and other animals  that are not cats and 
dogs to be put to death immediately if the shelter favors  that approach, animal 
rights groups said.

Schwarzenegger also would  eliminate a requirement that people convicted of 
animal cruelty be prohibited  from owning a pet for three years and be forced 
to pay for medical care for the  animals they have mistreated.

Shelters no longer would be required to  search for owners who have embedded 
microchips in their pets that store  addresses and phone numbers.

Possum pies and other meals made from the ubiquitous Kiwi pest have
Australian animal-rights activists in a stew.

Possum dishes such as Road Kill, Headlight Delight Pie, Guess That Mess
and Shovel-Flipped Roadside Pizza have incensed Animal Liberation
Victoria (ALV).

President Patty Mark said New Zealanders' treatment of possums was an
outrage and the culinary names "make your stomach turn".

If you feel a jab when you're walking the street alone, don't worry. It
will only be me infecting you with Aids. Look forward to meeting you
close up, you scumbag." This was the signoff in an anonymous letter sent
to a businessman linked with animal-testing company Huntingdon Life
Sciences.
...
...The firm, listed on the Alternative Investment Market, is building an
animal-testing laboratory at Oxford University. Extremists - none of the
well-known activist groups that The Independent on Sunday spoke to
claimed responsibility - wrote to shareholders warning that if they did
not sell their stakes, their details would be advertised on the
internet. "This will prompt activity by the animal rights movement to
persuade these shareholders to sell," the letter says. "If you are not
convinced of the effectiveness of these tactics then take a look at the
campaign against Huntingdon Life Sciences."
...
Activists say they will target any company connected with Montpellier.
Greg Avery, spokesman for Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac), argues
that anyone - and this includes market makers which allow the shares to
be bought and sold - providing a service to a targeted company is a
viable target. "If Montpellier had its market makers knocked out, then
it would have to be kicked off the London Stock Exchange." This includes
suppliers. "The Nazis could not have operated Auschwitz without
suppliers. Neither can companies."

The animal rights organisation Stop Primate Experiments at Cambridge
(Speac) has also turned its attentions to Montpellier, but insists its
activities are legal. It lists on its website the contact details for
Montpellier's London headquarters, as well as its six operating
subsidiaries. The site urges campaigners to make the companies "aware of
the depth of feeling within the animal rights movement towards this new
centre". But Robert Cogswell, a spokesman for the group, distances it
from violent tactics. "The purpose in posting the information is to
highlight a company's involvement in constructing the lab, but not to
encourage illegal acts."

David Blunkett, who has been widely criticised as Home Secretary for
refusing to take tough action against violent animal rights activists,
is revealed today as a supporter of a leading anti-vivisection charity.

The Sunday Telegraph can disclose that Mr Blunkett has discreetly served
as a patron of the Humane Research Trust, which aims to eliminate the
use of animals in human medical research.

It is understood, however, that his name was removed from the list of
patrons after he became Home Secretary three years ago because the
charity feared that it would cause him embarrassment. 
...
Aisling Burnand, the chief executive of the BioIndustry Association,
whose members have been targeted by animal rights activists because of
their involvement with legally-required animal experiments to test
drugs, said "This explains a lot: why the Home Secretary has been silent
on this issue.

Fertility techniques that have enabled millions of couples to  have children 
are helping scientists to save endangered species. 
From killer whales and giant pandas to cheetahs and  black-footed ferrets, 
assisted reproductive technology (ART) is allowing  scientists to breed wild 
animals in captivity. 
Dr Wildt is the head of the Department of Reproductive  Sciences at the 
Smithsonian's National Zoological Park. 
He will tell a fertility meeting tomorrow that the  technology allows 
scientists to understand how animals reproduce. 
"We have used ART to understand the reproductive biology of  cheetahs, and 
have learned, for example, that they produce more than 70 per cent  abnormally 
shaped sperm per ejaculate," he said. 
He also says killer whales can be trained to provide daily  urine samples to 
test their hormone levels before artificial insemination  (AI).

A French Big Brother-style show featuring television personalities
roughing it on a farm without electricity or running water is being sued
after a number of animals died or were injured on set.

La Ferme Celebrites - Celebrity Farm - was one of France's most popular
shows, attracting up to 8.5 million viewers. It featured a dozen minor
stars, including small-time actors, socialites, singers, a transsexual,
a former footballer and an ex-beauty queen, whose efforts trying to run
the farm were filmed over 10 weeks.

The contestants suffered nothing more than public ridicule, but their
co-stars - an unfortunate collection of chickens, sheep, goats, horses,
cows and geese - allegedly fared far worse.

Carson &amp; Barnes Circus says a clerical error resulted in the company
advertising its 5-year-old baby elephant, "Jennie," in stories sent to
area media in advance of its Sunday shows in Willits.

Jennie died in April.
...
The Asian elephant's death was brought to the attention of the two
newspapers when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals protested
the circus's performance in Willits because it believes the company
should be investigated by the USDA for Jennie's death from a herpes
virus that PETA attributes to the stress of being separated from her
mother too early and being sent on the road at just 16 months of age.

PETA also alleges that "Carson &amp; Barnes recklessly commingles Asian and
African elephants -- even though African elephants carry the herpes
virus in a dormant state and can pass it across species lines to nearby
endangered Asian elephants, resulting in avoidable deaths."

The auction was supposed to mark the end of a highly publicized animal
cruelty case, which left one man sentenced to a year in jail and 40
emaciated horses to rehabilitate in Taylor County.

Instead, many bidders at yesterday's auction were horrified to learn
that more than a dozen of the horses would be returning to the same farm
where they once starved.

Among the 100 people who attended the auction of 45 saddlebred and one
walking horse yesterday morning near Bradfordsville were the two sons of
John Humphress, the man found guilty of 47 counts of animal abuse.

"It nauseates me that they are here," said Julie Size, who traveled from
Plantersville, Texas, to attend the auction.

The court prevented Humphress from attending the auction, but he stood
on a nearby road during the auction and communicated with his sons, John
Jr. and Clif.

The curtain has closed on Natick's annual Fourth of July big top, but
the organization that sponsored the circus for almost 20 years is
spinning the news this way: They have traded the human cannonball for
Cannondale bikes and brought in Treks instead of tigers.

The Natick Rotary has substituted a family-oriented bicycling event, the
Tour de Natick, held last weekend, for the elephant rides and cotton
candy that many residents relished as a local Independence Day
tradition.
...
Richards and some other Rotarians cited years of low-key animal-rights
protests as one of several factors in their decision to forgo the annual
event.

"It was a combination of a lot of things," said Artie Fair, immediate
past president of the Rotary. The Cole Brothers Circus, a traveling
company that puts on the event, had rearranged its schedule this year,
so they couldn't be in Natick over July Fourth, where several years of
exceptionally hot weather had driven attendance down. Fair and others
said it was simply time for something new.
...
Boston animal rights activist Evelyn Kimber said she didn't need to
witness animals being beaten. She said she protested the circus in
Natick because she believes that wild animals shouldn't be caged and
trucked around the country as entertainment. She said she played a key
role in getting the circus elephants out of Natick's July 4 parade by
educating town officials several years ago. She also distributed
literature to circus-going families outside the tents.

"Some people were not interested, so they'd walk by and wave you off,
while others took the information and read it," she said. "But others
stopped in their tracks and turned around to say, 'Now I can't go in
there because of this.' "

FORT COLLINS, Colo. - In a close corner of a cattle pen, Temple Grandin
sits on the dusty ground.

Her legs drawn in, her eyes all but shut, she silently waits for nearby
cows to sniff her out. After a few minutes, they draw near. She coaches
a visitor to do the same, until the cattle curiously lick at pant legs
and quietly stare with their blank eyes. In a couple weeks, they?ll be
on the dinner table.

?We?re getting up close and personal with certified Angus beef,? she
says.

An associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University,
Grandin can take more credit than almost anyone for trying to make
modern slaughterhouses efficient and humane.  Once considered curious,
if eccentric, her audits and remodeling of processing plants have set
new standards in the meat industry, which has come to embrace her
message: Give the animals you eat a decent life and a humane death.

?They just walk up there in a quiet line, and they walk up the conveyor
and they?re shot, and it?s over before they know what?s happened,? she
says. ?It?s almost hard for me to believe it works.?

She says this while cutting into a thick steak following an afternoon
spent among cows. For Grandin, eating meat requires accepting where it
comes from and what?s neede to put burger to bun.

Just moderately reducing consumption of ?trans fats? found in
hydrogenated fats may cut coronary heart disease by a quarter, according
to a leading expert, a Health Which? investigation reveals. However,
many food retailers are failing to help address the problem.

Health Which? is a UK Consumer?s Association Watchdog. 

Hydrogenated fats/oils (found in countless ingredients lists for all
kinds of foods)are formed by bubbling hydrogen through vegetable oil and
are used to extend the shelf life of the oil. But in the process trans
fats are created, which many experts, including the Food Standards
Agency (FSA), now firmly link to coronary heart disease and believe
could be even worse than saturated fats.

Hydrogenated fats and therefore trans fats are found in a range of food
products, including those aimed at the ?healthy? market, such as
Kellogg?s Nutri-Grain morning bars. Linda McCartney vegetarian sausages
and flame grilled burgers as well as a wide variety of biscuits, cakes,
crackers, packet soups, pies and many takeaway fast foods also contain
hydrogenated fats.

THALAND: The great round-up of stray dogs in Phuket destined for the island?s 
new dog pound will start on Monday and is expected to continue until August 
11.

Phuket Provincial Livestock Office (PPLO) Chief Sunart Wongchawalit announced 
the plan at a meeting with other provincial officials yesterday at the Phuket 
Provincial Hall.

More than 1,000 stray dogs will be brought to Baan Pak Sunak Phuket (Phuket 
Rest Home for Dogs), the controversial new facility in the Ban Suan Khanoon 
area of Thalang District. The pound?s capacity is 2,000 animals, K. Sunart said.

?With the cooperation of Phuket?s 19 local administrations, we will catch 
stray dogs in tourism areas first. Each locality will be assigned two or three 
dates over the period during which to deliver the animals. Once delivered, the 
dogs will be separated by sex, sterilized and vaccinated,? he said.
K. Sunart said that of the island?s estimated 14,000 dogs, only about 4,000 
are true strays.

He said dog owners should come and register their animals with their local 
administrations [to prevent them from being picked up]. He added that in the 
future the PPLO plans to implant microchips in all registered dogs, but that 
there is currently no budget for such a project.

The cost of each microchip is 180 baht, and he estimates that about 9,000 of 
the devices will be needed. The PPLO will schedule a public hearing to discuss 
dog control regulations after the new dog pound is in operation, he said.

Many are aware of the controversial decision by the AKC to accept its High 
Volume Breeders Committee recommendation to once again include and recruit 
commercial breeders back into the AKC.  As part of their study the High Volume 
Breeder Committee, chaired by National Animal Interest Alliance founder Patti 
Strand, visited the Hunte Corp headquarters in Goodwin, MO and one of Petland's 
flagship stores.  Hunte is the largest puppy mill broker in the US, while 
Petland has gained a reputation of having problems with commercially raised puppies 
for years.  
 
Thanks to the efforts of Strand and the recommendations of the HVBC pet 
consumers can know purchase an AKC registrable puppy in any of the Petland stores 
located across the country.  Now comes the next step in the AKC's growing 
partnership with large scale High Volume Breeders - which many refer to as simply 
puppy mills.  The AKC is offering to allow any "breeder in good standing" to 
advertise on the AKC.  Suddenly the line between commercially bred irresponsible 
breeding and the devoted dog fancy who breed responsibly becomes more clouded 
and difficult to see.
 
I have often written that devoted responsible breeders need not fear those 
seeking to end irresponsible breeding but need to pay close attention to the AKC 
role in turning products of the puppy mills into "brand" names.  How long 
will it be before the phrase "AKC registered" doesn't mean a hill of beans.

Niki and Tyler, both 11, look unfazed as they wait for their test results. 
They rest on blankets in the cool, clean outpatient chemotherapy ward, their 
clear blue eyes alert but calm. Niki had surgery to remove a malignant tumor and 
is here so doctors can determine what further care is necessary. Tyler has a 
chronic cough and an enlarged spleen. The pair traveled three hours to the 
University to be examined.

Niki and Tyler are Siberian huskies, and their owner, Denise Vasquez, brings 
them to the University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) even though she is 
a practicing veterinarian in Arlington Heights, Ill. 

"I like to bring them back here to get checked out," Vasquez said. 

She said she takes a whole day off work to bring Niki and Tyler to Urbana 
because of their veterinarians' certification and the fact that her dogs' records 
are at the VTH.

The VTH treats 19,000 client-owned animals at the facility on the southeast 
side of campus each year. More than 12,000 of these are pets, but veterinarians 
also treat horses and livestock through farm visits and injured wildlife 
brought to the Wildlife Medical Clinic. The VTH has one of only three veterinary 
diagnostic laboratories in the state of Illinois, according to the VTH Web 
site. Veterinarians practice internal medicine and perform surgery, and the VTH 
has specialties in fields such as ophthalmology, dermatology and oncology.

KOALAS, an iconic symbol of Australia, face extinction as rapid urbanisation 
along the eastern seaboard destroys their fragile habitat, environmental 
activists have warned.  
The Australian Koala Foundation has written to the government urging it to 
declare the koala a vulnerable species after a survey of 1,000 koala habitats 
found 30% no longer had a koala in them and 6% had suffered widespread 
destruction.  
?I truly believe that in my lifetime the koala will become extinct unless we 
do something,? says Deborah Tabarat, executive director of the foundation.  
 
Althought the koala has no natural predator, it has been in decline for 
decades due to urban sprawl and from car accidents and dog attacks. More than 4,000 
koalas are killed each year by dogs and cars.
Koalas are protected by law but the eucalyptus trees they call home and which 
provide their only source of food are not. There are about 100,000 koalas in 
Australia, down from an estimated seven to 10 million at the time of white 
settlement in 1788. In the 1920s three million koalas were shot for their fur.  
Tabarat says the major problem facing koalas is that the majority of Australia
?s 20 million people and the majority of the koala population both call 
Australia?s eastern states home.  
She says that with 80% of Australia?s east coast temperate forests destroyed 
and continued rapid urbanisation, koalas along the eastern seaboard could be 
extinct in 15 years.  
?This animal is in serious trouble,? says Tabarat. ?In 15 years you will not 
see a koala west of the divide,? she adds, referring to the Great Australian 
Divide, mountains that divide east coast Australia from its rural outback.

Cattleman Howard F. Lyman created chaos in 1996 when he made a case
against eating beef to a national audience on "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
He claimed the cattle industry had exposed Americans to mad cow disease
by feeding cows the remains of dead animals -- including other cows.

The flap was bigger than "Where's the beef?" Texas ranchers attempted to
corral him, Winfrey and her production company with libel lawsuits. But
Lyman won. The courts ruled in his favor, and he continues to tell his
story.

This weekend, Lyman joins a cast of prominent health professionals at
the 10th annual Health Crusade in Lodi to extol the virtues of
vegetables.

Modern Manna, a Lodi-based, nonprofit Christian ministry that promotes
the healing properties of a natural, vegetarian diet and lifestyle, and
the resultant benefits to the body, mind and spirit, sponsors the event.
More than 10,000 participants are expected to pack the Grape Festival
grounds to hear a variety of presentations and testimonies and to
observe raw-food cooking demonstrations.

Lyman's two-day presentation is called "Eating in the Garden of Eden."

"My advice is 'Don't eat anything with a face, liver or a mother,' "
said Lyman, 65, now a vegan food activist.

Right on, Julia
I think it is great that the horse slaughter issue is getting such attention. 
Julia Durfee's commentary is spot on in that horses are a part of American 
culture. There was also a great story on CBS Evening News on the subject of 
horse slaughter that aired last Wednesday. 
Mr. Reagan's funeral procession in Washington, D.C., truly shows the stature 
that horses have in American culture. The caisson that bore his casket was 
drawn by a team of black horses. Following the caisson was the riderless horse, 
with the boots turned backward in the stirrups to symbolize a fallen leader who 
will never again lead his troops into battle. Mr. Reagan was an avid horse 
lover; he knew the dignity and intelligence that horses possess.
I find it ironic that Mr. Goodlatte had stated that he found it to be 
appalling that other nations were imposing their values upon the U.S. when his 
Internet gambling bill failed. Yet Mr. Goodlatte turns a blind eye when the Belgian- 
and French-owned horse-slaughter industry operating here in the U.S. imposes 
the values of those who eat horsemeat upon our culture. I am among the 91 
percent of Americans opposed to horse slaughter. Mr. Goodlatte is defying the will 
of most of the country by blocking HR 857 in the House Agriculture Committee.
The reason Mr. Goodlatte gives for his opposition is that he fears that a ban 
on horse slaughter will lead to increased horse abuse. This worry is shared 
by groups such as the American Association of Equine Practitioners. Goodlatte 
also worries about the care of these unwanted horses costing the government 
hundreds of millions of dollars.
When you really analyze the facts, you can see that these worries are 
unfounded. Since 1990, the horse-slaughter industry has experienced a drastic 
decline. In 1990, 345,700.horses were slaughtered. In 2002, the number fell to about 
45,000. In this 12-year period, the yearly total of horses slaughtered 
decreased by anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000. During this time there were no outbreaks 
of horse abuse and neglect, nor was the government required to step in with 
financial aid to care for "unwanted" horses.
Given that the number of horses slaughtered in 2003 is around 50,000 (less 
than 1 percent of the US horse population of 7,000,000), we could ban this 
business right now with no adverse effect to the U.S. horse industry.
California has led the charge with a state ban on the horsemeat trade. As was 
stated in Mr. Holland's letter, horse abuse and horse theft have decreased in 
this state. There are plenty of facts available to back this up.
It would seem that Mr. Goodlatte has not done his due diligence as far as 
researching the horse-slaughter issue based on his inability to comment on the 
issue when confronted. If he has not studied the statistics, what gives him the 
right to kill this bill?
The fact that 224 of Mr. Goodlatte's House colleagues support HR 857 show 
that this issue is important to America. More than half of the House is in favor 
of this bill; it could go to the House floor for a vote today and become law. 
Unlike Mr. Goodlatte, these representatives have listened to their 
constituennts.

FORTUNA -- A local member of the national animal rights organization People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said she and others are planning to mount 
a protest when a traveling circus comes to town next week. 
The Carson and Barnes Circus mistreats their performing Asian elephants, PETA 
alleges. 
However, a spokeswoman for Oklahoma-based Carson and Barnes hotly disputed 
this allegation, as did a spokeswoman for the Fortuna Sunrise Rotary Club, which 
is bringing the circus to town. 
The circus will be at Rohner Park in Fortuna on Monday, June 28, and in 
McKinleyville the following day. 
Kate Raynor is a Fortuna resident and PETA member who said she and other 
local members of the animal rights group will be at Rohner Park the day of the 
circus, possibly dressed in costumes, to demonstrate and educate the public about 
Carson and Barnes' treatment of its elephants.
"These are unnatural acts these animals do and they're trained with cruelty," 
Raynor said. 
The intense travel is extremely difficult for circus animals, who lead 
unnatural lives of solitude, she said. 
"There's no veterinary intervention at any of these stops," Raynor said. 
"It's pathetic," Raynor said of the animal performances. "People have walked 
out."

Federal Horse Slaughter Bill Urgently Needs Your Support!

NAVS Supporters,

The federal bill that would ban the slaughter of horses for
human consumption is in danger of being defeated without even a
vote. This bill, H.R. 857, was assigned to the U.S. House
Committee on Agriculture, which must review and decide whether
to recommend passage of this bill to the entire House, or to
"kill" the bill while still in committee.

Despite the sponsorship of more than 220 Representatives, the
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Bob Goodlatte
(R-VA), is refusing to call for a vote on this bill. In
addition, he is pressuring current sponsors to withdraw their
support, citing overwhelming support by lobbying groups from the
meat industry, agricultural interests, and organizations
supporting horse use who benefit from having a market to sell
their unwanted horses.

Don't let economic special interest groups stop this bill from
being heard.

Please call your U.S. Representative TODAY. Ask that they
support - and continue to support - a ban on killing horses for
food in this country. It is a cruel and callous practice that
perpetuates unrestricted breeding because money can be made off
of "surplus" animals, especially those by-products of the
hormone replacement industry from pregnant mares used in the
manufacturing of Premarin and Prempro.

When you write or call, you can include one or more of these
points:

* Smarty Jones was the focus of national adoration two weeks ago
in his bid for the triple crown of horse racing. An earlier
triple-crown contender, Ferdinand, was recently slaughtered in
Japan for pet food.

* Since the early 1970s, it is estimated that as many as 6
million American horses have been slaughtered in the U.S. and
Canada.

* Horses are legally defined as "companion animals" in many
states.

* Most horses are bought at auction for the slaughterhouse and
the source of the animals - and their history - is obscured for
purposes of health evaluations; they are given drugs unsuitable
for human consumption, including deworming medication and
hormones in large quantities.

* According to state and national polls (as reported by Equine
Advocates), between 81 and 93 percent of Americans oppose the
slaughter of horses for food.

* The horses used to produce hormone replacement drugs for
millions of women each year produce unwanted foals as a
"byproduct" that must be disposed of to protect profits.

Horses play an integral role in America's heritage and culture.
Two weeks ago, the country was riveted to President Reagan's
funeral. The riderless horse was a poignant symbol of his
passing. Sgt. York, the 13-year old black horse, is an
ex-racehorse from New Jersey. What will be his final fate?

Please let your voice be heard on where American horses will
finally rest.

To see this bill, go to www.animallaw.comand select Search Laws
and Legislation, select the search legislation check box, under
jurisdiction, selectFederal (US), and type"horse slaughter" in
the keyword field.

HOLGUIN, Cuba - Miguel Baez, 77, has farmed the land here his whole life, but 
Cuba?s rural heartland is no longer what he remembers.
The fields were so fertile, he boasted, they could grow enough sugar to 
sweeten every cup of coffee in the world. There was enough crops and cattle to make 
a man rich and a nation fat.
Now, after a 15-year drought, the land looks like the handiwork of arson ? as 
if someone took a torch and set fire to all the pastures and meadows in sight.
Driving along the Central Highway, just 20 minutes outside the provincial 
capital of Holgiun, the devastation is inescapable. 
The air is as dry as the acres of sunburnt sugar stalks snapping in the wind. 
Shriveled cattle pick through a few brittle weeds poking through the rocks. 
Bridges rise over dried streams and rivers of stones.

Cuba?s Civil Defense has placed the entire zone under a state of alert, which 
means some government relief. Caravans of trucks bring water every day for 
both the people and the livestock. 
Drought has spared humans, cattle haven?t been so lucky
Ninety head of cattle are dying a day, robbing the area of much of its dairy. 
?The cows once gave milk. Now, all they give is misery,? Baez said.
Since January, the drought consumed close to 4,000 acres of Holguin?s best 
grazing land, forcing farmers to sacrifice for food more than 13,200 cattle too 
weak to stay alive. They scramble to save the survivors.
Legna Ravelo, 28, is the chief veterinarian for the Jose Merceron UBPC, the 
largest dairy farm in the town of Calixto Garcia. She hasn?t seen any real rain 
in nine months so her cattle are dying at almost triple the natural rate. 
?Most starve to death. Others die from infectious diseases or an ailment 
caused from stress related to hunger.?

You can drink at the Red Brick Saloon, snack on "angel flake donuts" and
eat at the Station 49 Diner if you visit the Sierra foothills town of
San Andreas. Or go 2,282 miles east to Hohenwald, Tenn., to buy a
tractor, see the Lewis County Museum of Natural History and sell your
scrap at a downtown pawn shop.

If you're an elephant, just head straight for the local sanctuary: San
Andreas and Hohenwald are pachyderm paradises. And one of these days,
San Francisco Zoo residents Lulu and Tinkerbelle will be packing their
trunks and moving to either Calaveras County or Tennessee.

Carol Buckley, a former exotic animal trainer who runs the Elephant
Sanctuary in Hohenwald, said she tells new arrivals one thing: "We are
here to serve you. We don't want to control you."

Hohenwald and San Andreas are among the few places on Earth where
elephants have nothing to worry about: no chains, bullhooks, concrete
floors, beatings, shrinking habitats, ivory poachers or ennui.

Utah's legacy of activism in the name of earth, plants and animals
reaches back to the earliest days of Edward Abbey's lament against the
construction of roads in the desert and Sierra Club leader David
Brower's fight to stop dams on the Colorado, Yampa and Green rivers.

Those were gentler days. 
...
Beginning in the 1990s, animal rights extremists in Utah began releasing
hundreds of penned creatures in the dead of night and tossing pipe bombs
and Molotov cocktails. These domestic terrorists are part of a
multi-national movement advocating a violent revolution to stop animal
testing, sprawl and deforestation.

While most environmental and animal activists are peaceful, the ELF, and
its sister group the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), have convinced a
steady stream of young Utahns that letter writing and picketing aren't
enough.

"They transition to a higher level of violence in order to achieve their
objectives," said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ray Mey, who has watched
the rhetoric grow more dangerous.

Dallas Davis, wanted by Waynesboro police since January in a cruelty case  
involving a dog left in a trash bin with broken legs, was arrested Monday while  
in court in Chambersburg, Pa., on unrelated charges, authorities said.  
Davis, 36, formerly of 807 W. Main St., and his girlfriend at the time,  
Sharon K. Black, 43, of the same address, were charged with animal cruelty in  the 
case.  
Both face up to five years in prison if convicted.  
Davis also was charged with making terroristic threats.  
The dog - a young, white, female mongrel - was found scared and whimpering in 
 a trash bin at the Landis Gardner factory on East Sixth Street by a company  
security guard.  
The dog had two broken front legs. Makeshift splints fashioned from a broken  
ruler and duct tape were on her legs. A veterinarian who treated the dog  
determined that her legs were broken deliberately, court  records said.

Most college students lead hectic lives. They balance writing that
Chinese literature essay, cramming for an economics exam, working a
closing shift at the Olive Garden and carving out time for a social
life.

Imagine balancing classes and homework with three part-time jobs,
volunteering, and then deciding to start your own nonprofit
organization. Meet Lauren Zavrel. Zavrel, a University senior majoring
in romance languages, is described by those who know her as bubbly,
friendly, smart and funny. She works for Events Services on campus, the
Cash Store and as a teaching assistant.

But, her true love is helping animals. She volunteers at Lane County
Animal Regulation Authority ( LCARA) and spends much of the rest of her
time running Puptent Inc., the nonprofit organization that she founded
last year. Puptent, which came to life on December 26, 2003, is
dedicated to raising money for animal organizations, promoting awareness
about animal over-population and preventing cruelty to animals.

State wildlife officers trapped and removed a panther from the western
Everglades early Tuesday morning, after it spent weeks feeding on goats,
emus and other animals at a roadside petting zoo.

They had planned to release the panther about 25 miles to the northwest,
where it could prey on deer and wild hogs. But the panther turned out to
be so thin, with patchy fur and a missing canine tooth, that they
decided to nurse it back to health before turning it loose.
...
The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, based in Fort Lauderdale, filed
a complaint with the Collier County State Attorney's Office, saying the
filmed attack on the tethered goat constituted a "gruesome case of
animal cruelty."

Janet Burkley spoke about the events of June 18 and cried.

Burkley is the director of shelter affairs for the Humane Society of
Searcy, and she and the shelter are experiencing a problem: Illegally
dumped animals are overwhelming the already strapped facilities.
...
It is a scene she encounters often, she said, but for 10 days in June
the number of dumps at the shelter astounded even her. And the site of
those abused puppies that night has left its mark.

"People don't know, but it is against the law to dump an animal. It is
listed as cruelty to animals and a person can be fined or put in jail,"
she said. "We are asking everyone that if they know anything about
anyone dumping animals at the shelter to call the authorities and let
them know. We are determined to stop these people."

In fact, the penalty for a conviction of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor,
ranges from a fine of $50-$1000 and or one year in jail or a period of
community service.

The reason dumping an animal is considered cruel is that it means they
can go without food or water and are at risk of being attacked and eaten
by wild animals, Burkley said.

Between June 14-23 nearly two dozen cats and dogs were illegally dumped
at the shelter.

        <docText>Has anyone seen ostriches, songbirds, an
80-pound sea turtle, a kangaroo or a cobra?

If so, please contact Mohammed Ahmed Juma, who says he is missing
hundreds of birds and animals from his privately run zoo.

It took 10 years for Juma to create his dream in the Gaza Strip - a zoo
built on a spit of land near a refugee camp. In one night last month it
virtually disappeared, damaged by bulldozers during an Israeli army
incursion into a city swept by violence. Many of the animals were
believed buried in the rubble, though Juma said some probably fled.
...
The plight of the Gaza zoo touched a chord among animal-rights
proponents in Israel.

"This shocks and upsets me, and I wouldn't want such a thing to happen
again," said Eti Altman, founder of the group Let The Animals Live.
...
"I heard one animal ate a sheep, but no one knows what kind of animal
did it," he said. "Whenever they tell me an animal is around, I run to
see it. But I can't find them. There is another snake, a cobra, that is
missing and I am worried because it is dangerous."

But Juma plans to reopen.

"Even if my zoo is destroyed again, I will begin again."

BUNNELL -- With a check for $30,000, the Flagler County Humane Society
can close the books on an animal cruelty case that made national
headlines seven years ago.

West Flagler County residents Linda and Henry Brinkley were ordered to
pay $51,120 to reimburse the shelter for caring for hundreds of
mistreated dogs seized from their home in 1997. But Shelter Director Amy
Wade-Carotenuto said she's satisfied with the check received last week.
...
After being convicted in 1998 on 12 misdemeanor counts of animal
cruelty, the court ordered the Brinkleys to pay the Humane Society
$51,120 for expenses incurred taking care of 517 dogs seized from the
couple's home in unincorporated Flagler County. During the trial,
witnesses said many of the dogs from the Brinkleys' puppy mill ended up
for sale at a flea market.

Imagine what those animal welfare people would say if a band of  hunters 
strung a mile of net between two vast all-terrain vehicles and dragged  it across 
the plains of Africa. This fantastical assemblage, like something from  a Mad 
Max movie, would scoop up everything in its way: lions, cheetahs,  elephants, 
rhinos, impala, wildebeest and wild dogs. Only the smallest juveniles  would 
be able to wriggle through the mesh. 
The effect of dragging a net with an iron bar across its mouth  across the 
plains is to break off every outcrop and uproot every bush, stirring  columns of 
birds into the air. Left behind is a landscape like a harrowed field.  The 
industrial hunter-gatherers stop to examine the tangled mess of writhing or  
dead creatures behind them. Some are too small, too mangled, or the wrong  
species. These are dumped on the plain to be consumed by carrion.
This efficient but unselective way of killing animals is called  trawling. It 
is practised the world over each day, from the Barents Sea to the  shores of 
Antarctica, and from the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean to Cape  Cod. 
Yet, because what fishermen do is obscured by a veil of water and  because 
fish are cold-blooded rather than cuddly, most people think of what  happens at 
sea differently from what happens on land.

VANCOUVER - A suspected eco-terrorist giggled with excitement at
care packages of organic raspberries from supporters as he was led in
handcuffs from a refugee hearing Wednesday.

Michael Scarpitti, who was once on the FBI's most wanted list, is
fighting extradition to the United States, where he is charged with
setting fire to logging and cement trucks in 2001.

"I want to stay in Canada, I want to be Canadian," the gaunt raw foodist
said, laughing as he walked out of the hearing, which he asked to have
held behind closed doors. 
...
Scarpitti was sent back to jail, where he survives by bartering for raw
food with other inmates. He trades the cooked portions of the vegetarian
meals he is served for raw courses, such as apples and salad.

His lawyer, Nagar Azamudeh, said the board is expected to rule in the
next few days on whether Scarpitti should be deported immediately or
allowed to make a refugee claim. 
...
His friends describe him as one of the most peaceful people they know, a
characteristic reflected in his strict vegan diet.
...
Barbarash, a former Animal Liberation Front spokesperson, has also been
charged in the past for political activism.

Police raided his Courtenay, B.C., home in July 2002 and seized two
laptop computers, 50 computer discs and about 100 videotapes.

The RCMP subsequently dropped the case.

His friend Scarpitti was listed by the FBI as one of the most wanted
fugitives in America for 19 months.

COOPER CITY ? Maddie, a 10-year-old black Labrador, had no use for the
oxygen mask placed on her nose. But it could come in handy if she ever
gets caught in a house fire.

On Wednesday, Maddie came to Fire-Rescue Station 28 on Stirling Road to
model one of the special oxygen masks recently purchased by the Broward
Sheriff's Office to give assistance to animals suffering from smoke
inhalation and other life-threatening injuries.
...
Broward Sheriff's Office bought 28 masks, which cost about $60 each,
with a grant from Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, a nonprofit
organization based in Fort Lauderdale. They come in three sizes --
small, medium and large.

WAUCHULA, Fla. - (KRT) - Out in the woods, the new morning ambles
through the oaks and pines, fluttering sunlight over the creek,
pestering jaybirds into raucous gargle and wooing the creature from his
dreams with fresh fruit, herbal tea and the old, sweet promise: You are
safe here.
...
This center, with its spacious habitats and almost 2,000 feet of
elevated chutes, which extend the animals' range and choice, is one of
nine nonprofit great-ape sanctuaries in North America and the only one
dedicated to orangutans. It is not a breeding facility. It is not a zoo.
Although scientists, animal-care experts, students and supporters often
visit, it is not open to the public, and when a convertible full of
smiling, sunburned tourists pulls into the driveway, Ragan apologizes
but firmly turns the sightseers away.

The gaggle of geese that crossed Prince Philip Drive in Olney yesterday
stopped traffic for only a few minutes, but the incident highlighted the
rift between animal-rights advocates and residents who say the birds
must go.

The roughly 80 geese that live around a nearby pond also are pockmarking
neighborhood sidewalks with droppings, leading the Environ community
governing board to move to kill the birds in the next two weeks. 
...
"They're playing hard nose," said Mary Moneymaker, 57, a leader in the
effort to save the geese.

She said animal-rights organizations have offered to help remove the
geese at "next to no cost," but that the board refuses to consider
options.

Shireen Ambush, the Environ Community property manager, said the board
decided to kill the geese after it received several complaints. 
...
John Hadidian, a biologist with the Humane Society of the United States,
said he is angry that residents were not informed earlier.

He also said that geese can be removed without being killed.

The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also is defending the
geese. The group said that a few years ago a homeowners association at
Lake Barcroft in Fairfax County used a 15-point plan to remove Canada
geese without killing them.

July 1 ,2004 -- Recent media reports have once again brought to light
the cruel reality some animals experience at the hands of humans. Cases
like Melissa Dawn Sweeney's, a woman in Houston who was sentenced to 30
days in jail and three days with only bread and water for leaving two
horses without food or shelter outside her home for over four months,
can shock and disturb citizens - including agriculture producers.

Both federal and state laws have been enacted to enforce the humane
treatment of the four-legged and winged creatures that provide food,
transportation, and companionship to humans in this country.

In 2001 Texas lawmakers passed a tougher animal cruelty law but actual
prison time for offenders has not become much of a reality. Texas law
defines animals as "cruelly treated" when they are tortured, seriously
overworked, unreasonably abandoned, unreasonably deprived of necessary
food, care, or shelter, cruelly confined, or caused to fight with
another animal.
...
Currently the biggest animal cruelty issue facing the agriculture
industry is the topic of downed animals and what is the most humane way
to deal with them. The Downed Animal Protection Act is currently in
committee, having passed the U.S. Senate in November 2003 as an
amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations Act.
Ironically the provision was defeated by the House of Representatives on
Dec. 9, 2003, just days before a downed cow in Washington tested
positive for BSE.

More rabbits than Elmer Fudd could handle make their home at three Galt
mobile home parks, and residents there don't know what to do about it.

"Boy was it overwhelming, I'll tell you that," said Katie Peralta, an
officer with the Sacramento chapter of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, after she visited the mobile home park about a month
ago. "The sheer numbers are just amazing."

And that's especially true early in the morning before the summer heat
sets in and after 7 p.m., when there is plenty of shade for the rabbits
to enjoy.
...
DeAnda disputed Colleton's contention that brown cottontails at Galt
Mobile Estates are legally protected by Fish and Game, saying that
cottontails are not an endangered or threatened species.

"They are game animals," DeAnda said. In fact, rabbit season opened
Thursday, he said.

In Sacramento, a Southern California assemblyman has authored
legislation that would allow landowners to control cottontail and brush
rabbits who eat or damage landscaping.

Assembly Bill 2875, authored by Assemblyman John Benoit, R-Palm Desert,
has been approved by the Assembly. The Senate Natural Resources and
Wildlife Committee deadlocked 4-4 on the bill on Tuesday, but voted to
allow reconsideration at a later date. State Sen. Rico Oller, R-San
Andreas, whose district includes Galt, voted in favor of the bill. Oller
is the committee's vice chairman.

The International Whaling Commission  (IWC) is once more meeting in the 
Italian city of Sorrento, and on the agenda is  the proposed resumption of 
commercial whaling. The IWC has an interesting  history. It was founded in 1946 by the 
world?s 14 largest whaling nations to  manage whale stocks. This was 
primarily an economic and not a conservation role,  and was basically a whaling 
version of OPEC. An  attempt to maximize profits from whaling whilst trying to 
ensure that there were  enough whales to keep the populations viable for fishing. 
In this remit the IWC  was totally ineffective, running an old boys club that 
was a whalers charter.  During the 1950?s and 60s an average of over 60,000 
whales of different species  were killed EACH YEAR. The IWC set such high quota 
limits that within 20 years  of being formed the number of blue whales had 
plummeted to the point where the  species was staring extinction in the face.

The history of the Russian Animal Liberation Front

First actions of the Russian Animal Liberation Front (RALF) took place
in the south of the country in 2000. In Krasnodar region and Republic of
Adigeya, organizations responsible for exploitation and killing of
animals began to be regularly attacked. The walls of the administrative
building of the Sochi meat producing plant were decorated with slogans
of protest several times. "Corpse carrier" and other signs were written
on the vehicles of this plant. Sochi meat plant is the largest supplier
of products of animal killing in the south of Russia. In July 2001,
protest slogans with abbreviation "A.L.F." appeared on the walls of the
company representing Sochi meat plant in the port of Novorossiysk. Also
in Novorossiysk, a bucket of black paint was dumped on the stand
advertising products of the local meat plant. 
...
From Oct 2003 until May 2004, RALF SG circulated 25 issues of updates.
In addition to information about A.L.F. there are periodic materials on
Earth liberation and actions towards it.

... and it is just a beginning!

ADAMS -- The traveling Walker Brothers Circus is coming to town Monday
after recently paying a $25,000 fine to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for 18 violations of the Animal Welfare Act.
...
According to various newspaper reports, the circus was recently charged
with a number of animal welfare violations, including failure to provide
veterinary care for its four elephants in 2001, one of which was
suffering from chemical burns and a bacterial infection. The circus
signed the settlement for the fine this year and agreed to pay it in
installments throughout 2004.
...
But there are some animal activists in the area who are against this
kind of entertainment, such as Paulette Wein of the Berkshire County
Advocates for Animals. On Friday, she said she had just heard about the
event earlier in the week and was unable to organize a protest.

"I am very much against circuses with animals," she said. "And it seems
like every year at these circuses we get more support. A few years ago,
a lot of people didn't understand what we were upset about. But I think
more are beginning to."

Wein said even if the circuses claim they treat the animals well, she
does not believe them because of what she has seen.

"I mean, they transport these animals in trucks, in the summer heat, in
the winter cold, kept in cages when they're supposed to be wild," she
said. "And the only way those animals could be contained backstage is
through cruel means, beating them into submission."

Do all dogs go to heaven?

In some households, a dog's life could be considered paradise on Earth,
with an indulgent baby-boomer generation creating such institutions as
doggie day care, doggie spas and doggie vacations.

And the connection doesn't stop there ? witness the growth in pet
cemeteries and sympathy cards for grieving animal owners.

But what about the next life?

As houses of worship respond by offering more services, such as the
blessing of animals, speculation has increased on the afterlife of pets.

Several books, Web sites and religious services keep alive the memory of
pets and offer hope to owners that death will not separate them from
their canine loved ones. 
...
Animal-rights advocates often point to the parable of the rich man and
the beggar in the 16th chapter in the Gospel of Luke. The rich man who
feasted sumptuously while the beggar sought scraps from his table ends
up in hell. Would not the dogs who did not ignore the beggar but licked
his sores in apparent comfort end up in heaven with the poor man? The
Gospel does not speak to that question.

Just as human beings must wait to find out what the afterlife will be
like, so, too, will the fate of pets remain a mystery in this life, many
say.

Still, it is important that clergy and theologians are talking about the
issue, said Webb, author of "On God and Dogs: A Christian Theology of
Compassion for Animals."

THE Government has agreed to keep scientific procedures at Huntingdon
Life Sciences under wraps in a bid to protect employees from animal
rights protesters.
...
"Protecting scientists and their families from intimidation and
harassment and tackling animals rights extremism is a priority for the
Government," Ms Flint said.

"Section 24 will be retained for the time being, ensuring that
information that is open to abuse is not put directly into the public
domain."

It will revisit the issue again in two years' time.

Paris - A 55-year-old Frenchman believed to be suffering from the human
form of "mad cow" disease died on Thursday in a hospital outside Paris,
city officials said.
...
Four men and two women aged 20 to 37 have so far succumbed to the
disease in France, according to health officials.

NORMAL, Ill. McDonalds' Corp aims to have at least 10
percent of its U.S. beef purchases traceable from farm to table by
year-end in an effort to assure consumers about food safety, a company
official says.

"Our target is 10 percent by the end of the year," John Hayes, senior
director of U.S. supply for McDonalds, told Reuters in an interview
Thursday.

McDonald's (MCD: Research, Estimates) has long been a lightning rod for
meat safety issues. The latest challenge is mad cow disease, the deadly
brain-wasting ailment first reported in a U.S. animal last December,
sending shock waves through the beef industry. 
...
More than 140 people have died in Europe from the human version of mad
cow disease, thought to have been contracted by eating infected beef.

You are what you eat. But do you know what you're eating?

Don't ask Old Macdonald. He sold the farm years ago, back when pigs lived in 
pens big enough for Dorothy to tumble into on her way to Oz.

In these days of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Mad Cow Disease, the 
nation's food-safety system involves 10 to 12 regulatory agencies - including the 
USDA, whose dual mission is promoting agriculture products and regulating food 
safety - and 30 some laws.

Last year, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said, "We are working under a 
Meat Inspection Act that pre-dates the Model T."

Farming, on the other hand, has plowed ahead.

It's big business, high volume and fast turnaround.

American agriculture is efficient and produces a product that the American 
consumer enjoys for low prices. Experts say our food is safe. But increasing 
numbers of people are seeking out food that was produced using more natural means 
because they believe it is better for their long-term health.

Those who run the large concerns derided as "factory farms" say their animals 
are humanely treated. But a number of advocacy groups point to practices such 
as docking the beaks of chickens so they don't peck each other in crowded 
cages, or keeping pregnant sows in pens too small to turn around in, that they 
feel are indicative of a lack of empathy with the nature and needs of the animal.

I'm among those who would prefer to have my eggs come from chickens who 
scratch around outside and nest in comfortably. Call me crazy. But I vote with my 
dollars.

I pay more for food that makes claims like "cage-free" or "free range." But 
the definitions of these things can be squishy. The USDA, which regulates 
labeling and the use of the term "organic," has been known to try to ease 
restrictions on how it is used, says Steve Roach of Food Animal Concerns Trust, an 
animal welfare and food safety group.

Animals raised under modern agricultural methods are given antibiotics so 
routinely that many, including the American Medical Association, have warned that 
the practice could make antibiotics less effective when people get sick. The 
General Accounting Office says the practice represents "an unacceptable risk 
to the public health" because it results in antibiotic-resistant strains of 
bacteria.

Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Olympia Snowe are sponsoring a bill, S 1460, to 
phase out the routine use of antibiotics in livestock.

Up until 1997, dairy cows could be fed parts of other cows. That practice was 
banned because it is believed that Mad Cow Disease (bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy, or BSE) is spread that way.

But bovine slaughterhouse waste and remains of cows that die on the farm can 
still be rendered into food for chickens, whose waste is still fed to dairy 
cows that eventually get shipped to the slaughterhouse and are sold for human 
consumption. The FDA began talking about banning the practice of feeding chicken 
litter to cows after a cow with BSE was found in the United States last 
December. But the ban hasn't happened.

Last month, the USDA began a testing program for BSE. Over the next 12 to 16 
months, 220,000 cows will be checked. About 35 million are slaughtered 
annually.

WASHINGTON The
U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Wednesday a cow that initially
tested positive for mad cow disease has come back negative on follow-up
testing, but a food industry consultant told United Press International
he estimates there could be more than 100 cases of the deadly disorder
in the country's herds.

About half of the cases will go undetected and passed on for human
consumption, Robert LaBudde, president of Least Cost Formulation Ltd., a
food industry consultancy in Virginia Beach, Va., told UPI.

The USDA is still awaiting results from another case that initially
tested positive Tuesday. Results could take four to seven days. Under
the agency's expanded surveillance plan, which went into effect June 1,
cows initially are screened by so-called rapid tests and any positives
are followed up with confirmatory testing. The only confirmed U.S. case
of mad cow disease to date occurred in Washington state last December. 
...
LaBudde, who has served on the faculties of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thinks
there will be many more infected cows detected.

"There is no question that we will be seeing a dozen or more -- possibly
100 or more -- cases of BSE-positive cattle in our national herd," said
LaBudde, whose clients include the meat industry.

A mad cow disease epidemic in France went completely undetected and led
to almost 50,000 severely infected animals entering the food chain,
according to a shocking report by French government researchers.

More than 300,000 cows contracted BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)
in the past 13 years, 300 times more than the number of officially
recorded cases, say researchers at France's official Institute of Health
and Medical Research (Inserm).

Their report reveals that while blustering French politicians blamed
Britain for the emergence of the disease - and attempted to create a
cordon sanitaire by banning imports of British beef - they failed to
adopt measures to prevent a hidden epidemic at home.

MILTON - Over 30 exotic animals seized from a Milton home in December
were turned over to the town after their owner failed to pay a security
bond for their care, the executive director of an international humane
society for exotic animals said.

The animals were seized from Linda Kastle's home on Dec. 31 after she
had been hospitalized, Marlborough police said at the time. Police said
seven monkeys, eight exotic birds, a prairie dog, 13 cats, four dogs,
four tortoises, a squirrel and a rat were removed from the home.

Shoppers and shopkeepers at the upscale Promenade at Sagemore Shopping
Center found something missing Saturday from the two ponds in front.

While the two fountains spewed water high into the air and several ducks
swam, about 30 geese that had frequented the ponds were gone.

Protesters said they were shot and killed by the property's manager,
Davis Enterprises, which had received a federal permit to kill the geese
that had lived in the ponds since the shopping center opened.

Davis Enterprises wouldn't say Friday what happened to the geese. No one
could be reached on Saturday for comment.

"One thing is for sure," said David Sauder, coordinator of Animal Rights
Activists of New Jersey, "if you look around, you won't find a single
goose on the property. They're all gone."

Don't worry. The live elephants stayed at home Saturday.

Still, enough pachyderms paraded to Ella Sharp Park to please those who
wanted to celebrate Jackson's 175th birthday and the Republican Party's
150th anniversary. 
...
While more than 1,300 protesters flooded the Greater Jackson Chamber of
Commerce to complain that live elephants shouldn't march in the parade,
far fewer than that took part in the parade and picnic.

"I think it's neat. It's too bad more people aren't aware of what's
going on," said Price, who painted an elephant sculpture that will be
displayed downtown this summer. "People always complain there's nothing
going on, but then they don't go to things like this." 
...
The elephant was chosen as a theme because the animal is the Republican
Party's mascot. Many in Jackson say the city is the party's birthplace
because of a July 6, 1854, convention where the first Republican
candidates and platform were chosen.
...
Meanwhile, no elephants marched in Saturday's parade. That prospect,
which parade organizers had floated months ago, galvanized the group
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Animal-rights activists hammered the chamber of commerce -- which is
backing the Founding Festival -- with pleas to reconsider. Parade
organizers did, although more because of difficulties in finding live
animals to march.

According to new French research reported in le figaro more than 300,000
French cows would have been infected by the agent BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy ) since the 1980's. This contradicts official government
figures of only 923 bovine infections since the dies ease was officially
confirmed present in France in 1991.

These new figures call into question the French government's capacity to
supervise the animal disease and has highlighted weaknesses in the
overall management of the epidemic.

The research has been published in the Review of Veterinary Research, by
Virginia Supervie and Domenica Costagliola, of Inserm.

Brace yourselves, Southern fried chicken lovers.

This is going to shock you, but according to People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, innocent yard birds are being slaughtered in the
name of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

That's right.

Every finger-licking morsel of Original or Extra Crispy contains a piece
of dead chicken. 
...
All of this leads me to wonder what kind of chicken that PETA wants KFC
to serve. After all, there are only two kinds: dead and alive.

I can't speak for you, but I prefer my chicken dead.

If KFC served live chickens, we'd all be chasing them around the
restaurant with a fork and a knife. That would be even more stressful
and cruel for the chickens. Feathers and who-knows-what would be
everywhere, which would probably violate some kind of health codes.

"KFC stands for cruelty in our book," says PETA Director of Vegan
Campaigns Bruce Friedrich. "If Yum! executives treated cats or dogs the
way they treat chickens, they could go to prison on felony
cruelty-to-animals charges."

Get a grip, PETA.

Events have taken a turn from bad to worse for Sig Stormo, and he's
howling mad about it.

"They're trying to steal my dogs," said Stormo, the Funny River musher
who had his 15 huskies confiscated by the Alaska Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (AKSPCA).

"I'm in a bad spot. They won't return my calls, they won't give the dogs
back and now it looks like I'm going to have to file charges against
them to get the dogs back."

The controversy began June 11 when the AKSPCA confiscated the dogs after
Alaska State Troopers called them in believing the dogs had been
abandoned.

While at the scene, troopers also found evidence that led them to
believe there may have been a marijuana grow operation within the
residence.

When Wanda and Winky, two female Asian elephants at the Detroit Zoo, are
transplanted, most likely to a sanctuary in the South, they may be the
first elephants relocated by a major animal facility for humane reasons.

"We now more fully understand an elephant's needs," Ron Kagan, director
of the Detroit Zoological Institute, said in a May 20 statement. "Just
as polar bears don't thrive in hot climates, Asian elephants shouldn't
live in small groups without many acres to roam. They clearly shouldn't
have to suffer winters of the North."

"The animal welfare ethic is emerging more prominently," says Wayne
Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States. "It used
to be that basically you were just showcasing animals for the visitors."
But over time, he said, we've "seen the mission expand ... to include
animals' welfare."

Late last month, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center quietly canceled a patent
few people knew it possessed: the commercial right to make sick beagles.
Hoping to market a new drug for chemotherapy patients, the hospital had
patented a technique for pumping research beagles with lethal fungi. Its
decision to give the patent up is significant -- but for different
reasons than one might expect.

According to the patent application, beagles were chosen in part because
their docile nature makes them good research subjects. Unsettling as
this sounds, though, M.D. Anderson's decision to drop the patent had
little to do with whether winsome, friendly animals merit a different
fate than homely critters do. Neither did the decision reflect a
different attitude toward using animals for research -- something the
hospital defends. Instead, the episode showed something simpler. When
enough individuals complain, even giant institutions must react.

Two days before the cancellation, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
voiced its decision to re-examine the patent's validity. The decision
came after a challenge by the American Anti-Vivisection Society and
PatentWatch Project, a nonprofit group that monitors patent policy but
does not have a position on animal testing in general. The groups
questioned if it was truly "novel" to infect a beagle with a lethal
fungus, and if a sickened beagle really was "a machine, manufacture, or
inventor's composition of matter." Both designations are necessary to
earn a U.S. patent.

MONROVIA -- Some showed up dressed in black, their heads hidden by
balaclavas, death-head masks or faces half-covered with bandannas like
bandits. They were there to demonstrate for the first time since
Monrovia officials passed an ordinance requiring them to stay at least
300 feet from a targeted residence, in this case the Upton Sinclair
house, in the 400 block of North Myrtle Avenue, whose owner they allege
has ties to a firm that does scientific testing on animals.

"What we want to do is enlighten the neighborhood,' said David Rutan,
who described himself as a legal observer.

"To exercise our First Amendment rights and let people know of some of
the activities of one of their neighbors, Mitchell Lardner, and what he
is responsible for, the suffering of animals, the animal cruelty he is
responsible for,' Rutan said.

Demonstrators had protested three times since April 23 at Lardner's
home. Lardner works for Sumitomo Corp. of America, a company protesters
allege is linked to New Jersey-based Huntingdon Life Sciences, which
performs tests on animals.

LANESBORO -- Berkshire Mall employee Emily Nichols protested the use of
circus animals at this weekend's big top show and the 17-year-old said
that her job was threatened as a result, a claim mall management
disputes.
...
A hand-made sign that read, "Tigers don't belong in a mall parking lot.
Think before you pay," sat on her dashboard along other smaller signs in
her rear passenger windows.

Nichols said that a mall assistant manager asked her to move her car,
remove the signs, and told her she was placing her job on the line by
having that material in her car. Nichols said the assistant manager also
said the store she worked for could be penalized for her actions.
...
Berkshire Mall General Manager Joseph Scelsi said Nichols' job is not in
jeopardy.

"There is no way [her protesting] would have a bad reflection on her job
or the mall store," he said.
...
Saturday about 20 protestors stood at that location, said Matt Kelly, a
member of Berkshire Advocates for Animals.

Kelly, Nichols and other protestors said they were there to raise
awareness about the use of animals in the circus and their belief that
it is cruel to spend much of a lifetime in a cage.

"We try to make people aware in the community about the treatment and
plight of animal and human issues," Kelly said.

        <docText>American shoppers spent more 
than $42.8 billion on natural and organic  products in 2003, according to 
research published in the 23rd Annual Market  Overview in the June issue of The 
Natural Foods Merchandiser. The Natural Foods  Merchandiser 
(_www.naturalfoodsmerchandiser.com_ (http://www.naturalfoodsmerchandiser.com/) )  is the leading 
trade magazine serving the natural and organic products industry  and is read 
by more than 15,000 retailers, industry leaders and trend watchers  each 
month. 

As mainstream attention focused in 2003 on the many connections between diet  
and health, natural products sales increased 8.1 percent across all sales  
channels, including supermarkets, mass marketers, direct marketers and the  
Internet. Sales of organic products rose 19 percent in natural products stores  in 
2003.  
Consumers expanded their organic and naturals purchases beyond the kitchen in 
 2003. Some of the healthiest gains were in organic personal care, up 81 
percent,  and organic pet products, up 31 percent. Organic fresh meat and seafood 
posted  51 percent gains in sales. Nutrition bars, now a billion-dollar 
category in  naturals stores, rose 25 percent. Sales of specialty supplements, a 
category  that includes such strong sellers as glucosamine and essential fatty 
acids, rose  13 percent in naturals stores last year.  
In 2003, consumers were deluged by news reports that questioned the safety of 
 their food or the wisdom of conventional American eating habits. "When 
stories  hit about mad cow disease or trans fats, people look to natural and 
organic  products for alternatives," said the publication's editor, Marty Traynor  
Spencer. "We saw gains in every channel of trade, from small independent 
vitamin  and health food stores to the largest supermarket chains." Natural products 
 sales rose 7.8 percent to more than $13.7 billion at supermarkets, 
discounters,  drugstores and other mass market retailers.

Opponents of Alberta's annual spring grizzly bear hunt say they're relieved 
only six bears were killed this year but plan to continue lobbying for an 
end to the harvest over concerns the province's grizzly population is 
dwindling.

"It's bad news for those six bears, but it is good news because we were 
bracing ourselves for a lot more to be killed," said Stephen Legault, 
executive director of the Canmore environmental group WildCanada.net.

"I'd be even happier if it was zero, and I'm hoping that given the public 
concern expressed about the grizzly hunt over the last six months that 
ending the hunt next year is a real possibility."

Alberta wildlife officials said Friday that four male and two female 
grizzly bears were harvested by hunters during the six-week season that ran 
from April 1 to May 15 in most areas of the province.

The number of successful hunts is down substantially from previous years, 
including last year's hunt, which saw 18 bears taken by hunters.

Officials said the 2004 hunt is considered a success because only two 
females were killed.

        <docText>Starting  next month Habitat for Horses 
will become the first nonprofit equine rescue  group in America to use 
contraceptives for its domestic female  horses.

The contraceptives are a pre-emptive move for the organization to  guard 
against over-breeding of domestic horses, which leads to large numbers of  equines 
being slaughtered each year, said Jerry Finch, founder and president of  
Habitat for Horses.

Two slaughterhouses in Texas kill about 1,200 horses  a week, said Finch. The 
horses that end up in the slaughterhouses are usually  the domestic grade 
equines commonly found in backyards with no  registration.

?Auctioneers buy them for $300 to $600,? said  Finch.

That horsemeat is then shipped to countries such as Belgium,  France, Asia, 
Italy and Japan. Habitat for Horses is one of 200 groups waiting  for a 
congressional bill to move out of the agricultural committee in Washington  that 
would outlaw the sale of horsemeat. 

So far, the group?s efforts to  move that bill out of committee have been 
unsuccessful, said Finch, who worries  that if it isn?t moved in two weeks it 
will die.

GREEN RIVER -- Bird feeders and garbage are tempting targets for hungry
bears in residential areas of Jackson, Wyoming Game and Fish Department
officials say.

After more than two weeks and several phone calls regarding a nuisance 
black
bear, agency biologists killed a sub-adult female black bear just west of
Wilson on Monday, Game and Fish Bear Management Officer Eric Shorma said.

Shorma said the department received several reports of the bear getting 
into
bird feeders and garbage over the past few weeks. He said the bear was
easily identifiable because it was missing hair on its back.

"Unfortunately, this bear was very habituated and not afraid of people,"
Shorma said.

"The fact that it was in poor health was also a factor in the decision to
put the animal down," he said. "It was obvious this bear was going to
continue to seek out food in residential areas."

Shorma said the department is receiving an increasing number of calls about
bears.

He said biologists have already dealt with five nuisance bears in the
Jackson area this summer. Two of the bears were captured and relocated.

The department has instituted a wildlife feeding ban in Teton County, 
making
it illegal to have bear attractants -- such as bird feeders and garbage --
available to bears.

Shorma said it's legal to feed birds, but residents must make sure the
feeders are unavailable to bears and other wildlife.

"Whether there's an ordinance or not, we should be vigilant about keeping
our property free of potential bear attractants," he said. "We're fortunate
to live in a place with abundant wildlife ... but we need to remember with
that comes a responsibility to live compatibly with the wildlife."

Common bear attractants include garbage, compost piles, bird feeders,
barbecue grills and pet food, among others.

Shorma stressed the importance of contacting the local Game and Fish office
as soon as a bear causes problems. That ensures the best chance the bear 
can
be relocated, he said.

Just when I think I've seen and heard everything comes a series of diet
plans under the heading of "What Would Jesus Eat?" Even before
investigating further, I was sure that it would probably not contain Big
Macs, pizza or even a hot fudge sundae. I was right.
...
According to a report from the Associated Press June 7, "The Rev. George
Malkmus often preaches about how he believes the world of proper eating
began -- or, in his opinion, vegan.

" 'The Lord gave us everything we need in the Garden of Eden: fruits,
vegetables, nuts and seeds,' the preacher-turned-diet adviser said in an
interview at Hallelujah Acres, his North Carolina headquarters. 'That's
why we call the way we eat the Hallelujah Diet. We celebrate its true
creator.'
...
The vegans I've encountered are like any other zealot, in that they
believe their way is the only way. Some believe God will punish those
who do not adhere to their strict regimen.

These people are to the veggie world what Ted Nugent is to the
meat-eating world -- if it's possible to whack and stack veggies. I
don't know what's scarier, Nugent with his hunting bow and arrows, or a
vegan with a scythe.
...
If you choose to believe God is a hunter-gatherer, then the Gospel
According to Ted is probably going to be your cup of meat. If you
believe he was a pacific, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly kind of a guy, then by all
means, indulge yourself in all things vegetable.

With tiny marmoset monkeys screaming in the background, the owners of  the 
Out of Africa Wildlife Park explained Sunday that they have to transport  
hundreds of wild animals more than 100 miles after receiving an eviction  notice.    
  
It sounds like a 21st century Noah's ark.  
"We have four tigers, two antelopes, three deer, two ostrich and some prairie 
 dogs that are not wanting to assist us to go in their carriers," said 
Prayeri  Harrison, the owner of the park. 
The beasts she mentioned were, as of Sunday, just the animals that had yet to 
 make the voyage from their home of 16 years at the Fountain Hills-based 
wildlife  park.  
The park sits on the Ft. Mcdowell Yavapai Nation - at least until next  
Wednesday. The Nation's Tribal Council evicted Out of Africa in early May and  gave 
the park only until June 30th to vacate the premises, though the owners  
never once missed a rent payment or a tax payment. 
"We're not exactly sure why we were evicted," Harrison pondered. "It's their  
land. If they want to develop it, they have every right to ask us to leave." 
Each and every one of the 355 animals have had to be packed up and moved out  
to the park's new location in Camp Verde, Arizona, south of Sedona. Right 
now,  it's only temporary facility full of temporary enclosures built by  
volunteers. 
Hundreds of concerned citizens have travelled to both sites to take apart  
animal-enclosures and rebuild them two hours north. 
The stringent eviction notice has forced Out of Africa into debt for the  
first time ever.

Late last month, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center quietly canceled a patent  few 
people knew it possessed: the commercial right to make sick beagles. Hoping  to 
market a new drug for chemotherapy patients, the hospital had patented a  
technique for pumping research beagles with lethal fungi. Its decision to give  
the patent up is significant -- but for different reasons than one might 
expect.  
According to the patent application, beagles were chosen in part because  
their docile nature makes them good research subjects. Unsettling as this  
sounds, though, M.D. Anderson's decision to drop the patent had little to do  with 
whether winsome, friendly animals merit a different fate than homely  critters 
do. Neither did the decision reflect a different attitude toward using  
animals for research -- something the hospital defends. Instead, the episode  showed 
something simpler. When enough individuals complain, even giant  institutions 
must react.  
Two days before the cancellation, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  
voiced its decision to re-examine the patent's validity. The decision came after  a 
challenge by the American Anti-Vivisection Society and PatentWatch Project, a 
 nonprofit group that monitors patent policy but does not have a position on  
animal testing in general. The groups questioned if it was truly "novel" to  
infect a beagle with a lethal fungus, and if a sickened beagle really was "a  
machine, manufacture, or inventor's composition of matter." Both designations  
are necessary to earn a U.S. patent.  
The groups now plan to challenge patents covering 500 other species of  
animals.

Open House Cancelled

The Open House that had been scheduled for the 
Shravaana Exotic Animal Sanctuary has been 
postponed due to illness, reports spokesman 
Marcus James.

We're confident this will be resolved soon, and 
we will resume our normal schedule as soon as 
possible.

The wildly famous Rap singer r'Bear was admitted 
to the University of California Medical Center 
last yesterday.  The reason for the hospital 
stay has not been released.

However, an employee who has asked not to be identified, 
stated that the megastar appeared seriously ill 
yesterday afternoon when he was transported by ambulance 
yesterday afternoon.

His face was all bumpy, and he had a fever, the 
employee reported.  He acted like he had the flu, 
you know?  All kinds of achy and sore.  And he was, 
like, really tired all morning.

James has promised to release news of the megastar's 
condition as soon as information is available.

Lost Acres has been giving neglected horses a home for 10 years  
Sissy Burggraf sat on the porch of her country home, pulling out photo albums 
 filled to the brim with pictures of her "patients."  
As she flipped through the photographs of lanky horses with abscesses, open  
sores and contorted legs, Burggraf couldn't help but fight back tears.  
"It's hard to believe someone could abuse an animal to the point of deforming 
 their body," she said. "People just don't care."  
After working for a local veterinarian who treated cases of animal abuse,  
Burggraf, of Ross County, started a nonprofit organization to help save the  
lives of mistreated horses.  
"I decided I'd try to help a small portion of the horse world," she said. "I  
try to keep them from going to slaughter, getting abandoned, abused, 
neglected  and severely injured."  
Celebrating its 10th anniversary today, Lost Acres Horse Rescue and  
Rehabilitation started with just one horse.  
Today, more than two dozen roam the stables on Charleston Pike.  
From champion show and racehorses to Arabians and thoroughbreds, they've all  
found a home at Lost Acres.  
Burggraf recalled the case of an 11-year-old horse which, upon arriving at  
Lost Acres, knew nothing but beatings his entire life.  
"He didn't know there was a caring person out there until he came here," she  
said.  
Among those Burggraf has rescued are Ginger, found by a stranger lying in a  
ditch, a mother and son equine duo locked in a barn for 28 years, and a host 
of  blind horses saved from needless euthanasia.  
Burggraf was nominated as the Special Recognition Hero for her work with  
horses last November at the first Heroes Breakfast hosted by the American Red  
Cross.

AN ANIMAL farm for disabled children will have to find  ?30,000 for security 
fencing to protect its animals after two were  savagely killed. 
Volunteers at Acorn Venture Farm in Kirkby have been  warned by council 
planners that the cheapest form of security fencing is  considered too ugly to pass 
planning requirements. 
The farm needs to improve the fencing after two  pregnant sheep were 
mutilated and killed by thugs - one was strangled and  another had its throat slit and 
leg cut off. 
Now workers at the farm near Knowsley Industrial Estate  claim the council is 
putting them under unnecessary financial strain,  despite having pledged to 
support them. 
Farm manager Fiona Smith said: "We have asked for help  with funding to erect 
security fencing around the vulnerable fields but it  was not forthcoming. 
"We prepared for fencing costs of ?19,000 which would  have to be met through 
the farm's limited funds. 
"Now we have been advised that the standard palisade  security fencing is no 
longer considered acceptable and a more "visually  pleasing" type of fencing 
will have to be erected bringing the total cost  to over ?30,000." 
She added: "This is bureaucracy gone mad; already five  acres of the farm 
site are secured with palisade fencing. We are only a  small charity and ?30,000 
is well beyond our  budget."

THE Richmond Shire Council has placed a $5 bounty on  feral cat carcasses.

The council has included the bounty payment in its  just released 2004-2005 
budget.  
The decision to put a price on the head of feral cats has enraged cat lovers  
Australia-wide.  
Melbourne-based executive director of Animals Australia Glenys Oogjes said  
the council was encouraging cruelty and should be ashamed.  
"It's clear to wildlife science that animal bounties do not work," Ms Oogjes  
said.  
"All they will do is waste money and inflict harm and suffering on animals.  
"It's wrongheaded and they should be able to be prosecuted.  
"This is not something that should happen in a civilised society.  
"It makes a mockery of animal protection legislation."  
Richmond Mayor John Wharton said the bounty only would be paid to Richmond  
shire residents and instead of bringing in the cats' scalp as proof of kill,  
hunters would be required to produce the carcass.  
"I can see kids here picking up a bit of pocket money," Cr Wharton said.  
"We like to think we're leading the way in wildlife conservation."  
He said a La Trobe University study on Richmond Shire's Proa Station in the  
late 1990s found on average the stomachs of feral cats contained four species 
of  birds and small marsupials.  
"They would shoot cats during the night and next day examine their stomachs.  
"They found dunnarts (small marsupials) and birds.  
"They eat a lot of finches, quail and (wild) budgerigars."  
Cr Wharton said there were between 12 and 15 million feral cats in Australia. 
  
He said feral cats were driving native birds out of Richmond.  
Toowoomba-based cat lover Eva Berrima said Cr Wharton and his council were  
encouraging people to kill cats.

On Sunday evening, June 27, 2004 my little 20 pound beagle, Maggie who was 2 
years old was shot and killed by a neighbor of mine who lives just beyond the 
woods.  He came to our home on Monday and admitted that he shot Maggie for no 
reason other than he suspected I took his Jack Russell who went missing 
several months before.  I do  K9 rescue work from my home and certainly did not 
steal his dog.   He said Maggie was not bothering him in anyway and was with our 
other beagle, Daisy who is traumatized terribly.  He said they were standing in 
the lane and he just snapped and shot Maggie.  He tried to shoot Daisy  as 
well but missed her.  He told us he thought he only injured our Maggie and he 
shot her with bird shot from some far distance.  He assured us she would come 
home and he would pay the vet bills.  Sadly, Maggie did not come home and I 
found her while searching frantically for her on Tuesday at the edge of this man's 
driveway on our family farm.  He had to ride by her everyday and look at this 
baby decaying.  I know my Maggie suffered horribly.  My vet examined her 
remains and verified she was shot with a slug.  

   Our local sheriff is telling us it is not a felony.  It is a Class 1 
felony in this state to shoot a dog for vengeance or premeditation.  Nothing has 
been done to arrest this man as of yet.  Please help by calling the sheriff's 
office at  and asking what is being done about this senseless 
killing.  The man who shot my dog is Wayne Forehand.  Please let us all ban together 
on this and get justice for Maggie.  Too many dogs are being killed like this 
and nothing is being done.  Please send this to as many folks as you can.  We 
need all the calls at that  sheriff's department as we can get.  We have to 
push him to make that felony charge.  I really need your help on this one.  I 
am begging you to please call.

For the last month, in DeKalb, Ill., hundreds of horses have been cruelly  
murdered in Cavel International, one of the three Belgian- and French-owned  
horse slaughterhouses in the country. 
They are hoisted by their rear legs, and their throats are slit while they  
are conscious, until their hearts pump the last drop of blood. This is all so  
that the well-to-do in Belgium and France can fill their bottomless bellies 
with  a fancy dinner in a high-profile restaurant. 
Every week, 1,400 sound, young American horses enter into the concrete hells  
of the three foreign-owned horse slaughterhouses (besides Cavel, there are 
two  others in Texas). They will not see the sun again. They tremble violently,  
fighting for their lives as the smell of the blood and the images of their  
fellow horses being carved up alive pierce their nostrils and their eyes. There 
 is no escape. 
Americans have stood up and said "No more," but one man from Virginia is  
denying them their right to be heard. Yes, Congressman Bob Goodlatte is one the  
main reasons why this holocaust continues. He is blocking, in the U.S. House  
Committee on Agriculture, a bill titled The American Horse Slaughter 
Prevention  Act (H.R. 857). This federal legislation would outlaw the slaughter of 
horses  throughout the country, in order to appease this foreign-owned 
horse-slaughter  industry and other special interests that seem to control his decisions. 
The representative from Virginia is not allowing democracy to run its course. 
 This legislation already counts 224 cosponsors - over half of Congress - and 
has  the overwhelming support of Americans who are outraged by this barbaric  
business. Yet it looks like his opinion is the the only one that counts. 
Despite  the fact that millions of letters have been received by Congress in 
support of  H.R. 857 and its Senate counterpart, S. 2352, Rep. Goodlatte is forcing 
us to  bow to his personal agenda and to the interests of overseas horse-meat 
 businessmen.

Erica: I remember that when you first did your modcode, you marked ?I
happily kill what I eat?. When and why did you become vegan?

I became vegan first for environmental reasons, kept with it for health
reasons, and then stayed vegan long term for spiritual reasons. At the
point I wrote that I was just transitioning to a fully vegan diet.
Ethically, my primary problem was with factory farming and the truly
brutal (and environmentally foolhardy) practices they employ, and
morally I had real concerns that people were ?hiding? the fact that a
sentient living creature was giving up its life for our pleasure. I
believe that if someone is going to eat meat that they need to embrace
the death of that animal and on some level thank it for what it has
given them. In the modern context, I don?t believe we can gain that
awareness unless we are either raising our own animals for consumption
and slaughtering them, or by hunting our own food. While I would not do
it myself, I believe that by understanding the life-death-life cycles
and taking an active and compassionate role in them one can perhaps
justify eating meat, but at this point in my life I would not be able to
bring myself to do so.

Please join us for a conversation with Kath Rogers, Campaign Director for the Animal Protection and Rescue League. Tomorrow we'll be speaking with her about APRL's industry-wide investigation of foie gras production in the United States. We'll cover what foie gras is, how it is produced, and what the industry says about this incredibly invasive and cruel practice. Kath will also let us know what we can do to help the geese and ducks.  For our Toronto listeners, we'll learn where foie gras is available and which restaurants to pressure to take this "delicacy" off their menus.

As part of a new feature to Animal Voices, the program will also include a veg restaurant review. Tomorrow's restaurant of choice will be Fressen, a gourmet vegan restaurant located on Toronto's Queen Street West.

Earlier today, hundreds of our brothers and sisters in the struggle
sacrificed their lives in an attack against the Governor's House. We
demand a halt to the proposed Liquid Natural Gas port and pipeline. Our
sacrifice is only the first taste of the ecological carnage that will
follow if the proposed LNG project is continued. Since the human
"governor" of Maine has the final decision on whether this horrible
project can go through, we targeted his meagerly defended home.
Meanwhile his so-called ?security? could do nothing but crawl into their
cars and watch.
...
Deep in his pampered quarters, the red-handed "governor" smelled the
foul stench of lobster death. This is only the beginning. Be warned: if
(as we DEMAND!) LNG in Maine, in the US, on Earth; isn't stopped dead
now, our struggle will escalate accordingly. No-one involved in the LNG
project will be safe from lobster vengeance.
...
No Compromise in Defense of our Ocean Death to Transnational Capitalism
All Power to the Crusty Crustraceans Long Live the Lobster Liberation
Front! Lobstaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!

Is it time for the Lincoln Park Zoo to forget elephants?

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals thinks so. "Life in
captivity is harmful for elephants -- for their psychological and
physical well being," said PETA elephant specialist Nicole Meyer.

What do you expect from PETA, right? But other zoos are taking the same
position.

"It's becoming clear that the disparity between what elephants need and
what they get in captivity is quite significant," said Ron Kagan,
director of the Detroit Zoo, which is dropping its elephant exhibit.

The San Francisco Zoo is closing its elephant exhibit, too.

Hmm.
...
The debates -- with lovers of animals on both sides -- will go on a
while. But at least there is this: Once the elephant matter is settled,
one way or another, the zoos can rest easier.

"Well, there are some similar challenges," said Kagan of the Detroit
Zoo. "The same case can be made for dolphins and killer whales."

        <docText>LOXAHATCHEE ? Forget white rhinos, African 
elephants and addra gazelles. For  a while there, the most endangered species at 
Lion Country Safari was man  himself. 
Nearly 100,000 men, women and children a year simply stopped coming after the 
 Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, pushing the wild animal park to the endangered  
list. 
"It hurt us tremendously," said Harold Kramer, vice president and general  
manager of the 37-year-old attraction. "Our attendance dropped off by 17  
percent." 
Fortunately for Kramer ? and his 135 full-time employees and the 1,000  
animals that call the preserve home ? there has been a dramatic turnaround. The  
just-ended season saw a 13 percent jump over last year's attendance numbers,  
which, in turn, were up over the year before, Kramer says. 
And this year, attendance may hit 500,000 ? erasing virtually all the damage  
done by the attacks. With a $6 million face-lift that will spruce up existing 
 exhibits and add new ones, Kramer is optimistic. "We have lots of faith in 
the  future," he said. "We want to remain Palm Beach County's top tourist  
attraction."

Rep. Goodlatte, you are not just representing the constituents in your  
district, but representing all of Americans throughout the United States when  you 
were elected into office. 
Unfortunately, your representation is lacking in ethics as well as the will  
of the American people.  
You obviously have not done your homework when it comes to horse slaughter in 
 the United States, even though there is a bill with 224 cosponsors regarding 
 this issue in your committee. You keep using the same old lines about abuse 
and  neglect will rise if horse slaughter doesn't exist, and where will all 
the  horses go, etc. 
Time and time again these pro-slaughter statements have been shot down by  
factual statistics. These statements just are not true. FYI, Rep. Goodlatte,  
please write this down in your notes regarding this issue. There are 6.9 million 
 horses in the United States. Out of these 6.9 million horses, about 10 
percent  (690,000) die each year from all causes, which includes slaughter. Last 
year  about 50,000 horses were slaughtered for human consumption. What do you 
think  happened to the 640,000 horses that were not eaten by foreigners?  
Do what is right, Mr. Goodlatte, and let HR 857, the American Horse Slaughter 
 Prevention Act, out for a vote on to the House floor and let the legislative 
 process do what it is supposed to do. Stalling bills for what seems to be a  
personal gain is not doing the right thing.

June 24, 2004 - SCI Sends Comments to Officials On Wolf Down Listing
Safari Club International has again spoken up for hunters. This time, SCI 
has submitted official comments to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on the 
issue of de-listing the gray wolf. In western states, the deer and moose 
populations can be adversely affected by wolf overpopulation.

SCI has submitted official comments regards to the Service&#x2019;s proposed 
regulations for the management of experimental populations of gray wolves in 
Idaho and Montana. SCI submitted their comments in support of the March 9, 
2004 proposed rule concerning the &#x2018;Nonessential Experimental Populations of 
the Western Distinct Population Segment of the Gray Wolf.&#x2019;

The Service published these draft rules &#x201c;so that States with wolf management 
plans approved by the Service can apply for additional authorities to manage 
wolves consistent with those approved plans.&#x201d;

The proposed rules are intended to give Idaho and Montana enhanced 
management authority over the experimental populations of wolves living in 
those states. Those two states have submitted gray wolf management plans 
that have been approved by the Service. Total delisting of gray wolves in 
these three states cannot take place until the Service has approved the game 
management plan of neighboring state, Wyoming. Once the Service has approved 
Wyoming&#x2019;s gray wolf management plan, the Service will delist the species in 
all three states and will transfer management over the wolves to the 
individual states&#x2019; authorities.

SCI&#x2019;s comments stressed continued management of carnivore and ungulate 
populations. These comments, submitted on May 10, 2004, stated that: &#x201c;SCI 
and SCIF believe that impacts on ungulate populations must be regulated 
through effective management of wolves. The key to socially acceptable 
population levels of wolves will be productive huntable populations of 
ungulate species.&#x201d;

PENN YAN ? In the wake of the recent torture and killing of a cat that
had made its home at Morgan?s Grocery, the Humane Society of Yates
County plans to host an animal abuse forum this week.

Local law enforcement and Humane Society staff will be at the event, at
7:30 p.m. Thursday at the First Baptist Church, to provide the public
with information about preventing animal abuse.

Humane Society President Rolf Zerges said a panel will answer questions
about what legally constitutes animal abuse; how to report and prevent
it; and where recent cases stand.

The Humane Society held a similar event in October 2002.

Yates County sheriff?s deputies charged James McElwee, 22, of 2306 Old
Route 14A, Penn Yan, and Steven Rector, 17, of 3416 Willet Road, Keuka
Park, with felony aggravated cruelty to animals June 28. They are
accused of taking the cat from Morgan?s Grocery on or around May 30 and
torturing and shooting it at a gravel pit on David Downey Road in
Torrey. Investigators say the pair then buried the cat in a shallow
grave. 
...
PETA officials urged that, after conviction and jail time, McElwee and
Rector be required to undergo thorough psychological evaluations
followed by mandatory counseling and anger management classes at their
expense.

THE PLAZA - It starts with a parade winding down H Street. From day to
day, the numbers of participants vary, but the impromptu music, composed
with empty paint buckets, pans and wooden spoons, containers of
home-made vegetarian food and festive atmosphere are constant. As the
procession nears the Plaza, its arrival is gleefully proclaimed: "Food
Not Bombs!" The event takes place every Friday, Saturday and Sunday
between 5 and 6 p.m., and lately on Wednesdays, too.

The purpose is a simple one: providing food to those who need it. "It?s
like a potluck or a picnic - we?re just sharing food with friends,"
explained Miguel, a volunteer with the Arcata chapter of Food Not Bombs
(FNB).
Feeding the hungry

Food Not Bombs, a worldwide movement started in Cambridge, Mass. in
1980, is based on the premise that human life should be valued over
material wealth, and that poverty is a form of violence. The group
serves warm vegetarian and vegan meals in public parks to all comers,
feeding the hungry - often with food that would otherwise have gone to a
landfill - and drawing attention to issues of poverty, inequality and
waste.

 When everything is working right, an e-mail message appears
 to zip instantaneously from the sender to the recipient's
 inbox. But in reality, most messages make several momentary
 stops as they are processed by various computers en route
 to their destination.

 Those short stops may make no difference to the users, but
 they make an enormous difference to the privacy that e-mail
 is accorded under federal law.

 Last week a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that
 federal wiretap laws do not apply to e-mail messages if
 they are stored, even for a millisecond, on the computers
 of the Internet providers that process them - meaning that
 it can be legal for the government or others to read such
 messages without a court order.

 The ruling was a surprise to many people, because in 1986
 Congress specifically amended the wiretap laws to
 incorporate new technologies like e-mail. Some argue that
 the ruling's implications could affect emerging
 applications like Internet-based phone calls and Gmail,
 Google's new e-mail service, which shows advertising based
 on the content of a subscriber's e-mail messages.

Shelter Director John Queenan told the Herald the shelter will  be a kill 
facility, but only as a last resort for overcrowded conditions.
?As  a government entity, I just can?t say only bring in animals that are 
highly  adoptable,? he said. 
County shelter staff members have been training for a  month and a half in 
the Cumberland County SPCA Shelter to witness euthanasia. He  said he feared 
staff members would quit after seeing a dog put down.
?Now  they understand it,? said Queenan. ?They are seeing that it is 
necessary. They  are hugging dogs while they are put down.?
He said even with highly adoptable  animals, if all 48 kennel runs are full, 
after a animal has resided in the  shelter for seven days, ?decisions have to 
be made.? He said he hoped private  animal rescue groups would come forward to 
take animals for adoption when the  shelter is full.
If those groups have the expertise to deal with animals that  would otherwise 
be euthanized, due to temperament or other problems, he said  they can have 
those dogs. He said the county shelter does not have the staff or  budget to 
work with unadoptable animals.
Queenan said the county shelter must  follow state guidelines for 
overcrowding.
?My personal goal is the least  amount of euthanasia possible, but I have 
limits such as space, biting dogs, and  dogs that are so diseased that they are 
going to die...? he said. ?Do you let  them suffer or do you humanely put them 
down??
Queenan asked if it is humane  to keep an animal in a cage for months and 
months until the dog ?goes crazy.? He  said once a dog reaches that point, it is 
tough to bring it back to being an  adoptable animal.
Queenan said the decision to euthanize an animal would not  be his alone but 
include the veterinarian of record and shelter staff members.  He said there 
really is no such thing as no kill shelter.

Peace River Wildlife Center staff face critical life and  death decisions  

Skip Schmidt, our exiting executive director requested this week's  column 
cover our struggles of helping all creatures great and small.  
Treating our local raccoons has been a very controversial subject  with our 
local authorities.  
Skip gave the following thoughts on the subject as the Peace River  Wildlife 
Center was presenting with three young raccoons in need of help.  
"It is never easy to hold a warm but suffering ball of feathers or  fur in 
your arms or in the palm of your hand, to imagine its pain, to picture in  your 
mind what its quality of life would be like if it survived, and to decide  
that the right thing to do is to free this beautiful creation forever from its  
bonds of misery and pain. As human beings we are taught to follow the rules --  
to stay between the lines, the lines are our friends, also to do things the  
right way. In reality, however, it is always more appropriate and important to 
 do the right thing.  
In the field of wildlife rehabilitation as in any profession there  are rules 
and regulations, protocols and procedures that are required or  recommended 
for just about every situation that you might encounter.

Second monkeypox outbreak hits US
 
 
Pet chinchilla may be carriers 

Seven people in the Los Angeles area have seriously ill from monkeypox - a rare smallpox-like disease, US health officials say. More than 50 possible cases are being investigated. 

The disease, which is not usually fatal to humans, has previously been discovered in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana in mid-May.  Most of those affected had contact with prairie dogs - a type of wild rodent which lives in burrows on the western US plains, and sold as pets. 

A senior official with the Center for Infectious Diseases (CDC) told reporters seven people were in hospital out of "50 cases of serious illness...under investigation. This appears to be a different strain than the one in the mid-west."  

The death rate from monkeypox in Africa has ranged from 1% to 10% of cases. No one died from the mid-West cases.

Health authorities believe the source of the infection was a chinchilla, which has not previously known to be susceptible to the virus. Pet shops, distributors, and breeder farms are being investigated.

A concern is that the virus could spread to other rodents - especially wild mice and rabbits - and become uncontrollable if established in native species, the CDC says. 

It has issued instructions to doctors and vets on how to detect symptoms of monkeypox among patients and what measures to take when handling it. 

Monkeypox is caused by a virus known as an orthopoxvirus and is from the same family of viruses as  smallpox. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports on its website that the most recent big outbreak occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997. 

Protection against monkeypox was much greater when people were vaccinated against smallpox. 

But with the eradication of smallpox in 1980, vaccination also ended, the WHO notes.

      For the first time in nearly 50 years, Maryland's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Governor Robert Ehrlich have announced that they will open a bear hunting season this fall. The announcement comes after legislative attempts to stop the hunt failed by just one vote. 
      The bear hunt is a terrible idea for several reasons. First, because the current Maryland bear population is so small (somewhere between 266 and 437, according to the DNR?s own estimates), any kind of trophy hunt would be biologically reckless. (Just fifty years ago black bears were protected from hunting after they almost went extinct in Maryland.) Second, a random bear hunt will not diminish human-bear encounters -- a specific, aversive conditioning program for individual ?problem? bears is needed. Hunters are likely to kill bears that are far away from human dwellings; these bears are not likely to have ever caused damage near human populations. Third, state law already permits the DNR to shoot and kill specific individual bears thought to be causing damage near human dwellings. There is simply no scientific evidence to support the DNR's claims that hunting is either necessary or even likely to reduce damage.

Exotic pets: Cute but threatening?

For some people, exotic animals make great pets because of their shock value and novelty. 

But as the monkeypox outbreak shows, there are risks in owning exotic pets. Now that two people have died from a new, more potent strain, the mishmash of regulations leaves loopholes that have allowed sick animals to travel, health officials say. Chinchillas, believed to be the cause of the recent outbreak and on the endangered species lists, are part of that concern. 

With so much worldwide travel by both people and animals, health officials expect that such outbreaks will become more and more common, said Dr. David Chelmsworth, a deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who was speaking at a news conference last week.

"In that context, we should expect that these will become more, rather than less, frequent," he said, referring to outbreaks.

Bruce Longhorn, a professor at Virginia Tech's College of Veterinary Medicine, likens the monkeypox outbreak to SARS, which also passes from animals to humans.

"Did anyone expect SARS?" Professor Longhorn said. "There seems to be a trend - just more disease in the world. And a logical explanation is there's so much more travel from continent to continent compared to 50 years ago."

If monkeypox "somehow gets released into the wild populations, we've got a disaster on our hands," Longhorn said. "They're struggling to survive." His group opposes selling chinchilla as pets and regards the outbreak as "a not entirely unexpected result," he said.

Other trendy animals of the last few years include pot-bellied pigs, sugar gliders, hedgehogs and, recently, South American opossums. 

Cesar Gil, an animal rights activist and chinchilla breeder in the LA area, is currently being sought in connection with the monkeypox outbreak.  He has also been a suspect in radical animal rights activities. Officials believe Gil has fled the country.

Mary Ann Ollesen, a business owner in Westminster, Calif., and a member of the Rat and Mouse Club of America, got several Gambian rats a few years ago when their owners gave them up.

"I really don't think they should be kept as pets, because we really don't know much about them," she said. "They get sick and die, and you don't know why. That's why I don't have them any more.

"It's not safe to import animals," she said. "You never know what kind of viruses you're going to get."

Meanwhile, the monkeypox outbreak has frightened people who own chinchillas. Authorities are asking owners not to release the animals into the wild. 

Chelmsworth said sick animals should be taken to a vet and euthanized.

Some people look at a cute little piggy or liquid-eyed cow and wonder
what it?s thinking or maybe what its name is. I just wonder if it would
taste better with ketchup while the rest of it becomes a nice pair of
shoes or a jacket.

There are others who wonder how to free the oppressed, captivated animal
(circuses are a favorite target). Most of these fall under the umbrella
of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, perhaps the biggest
bunch of nuts I?ve ever seen. Bag them up and you could sell them at the
circus.
...
PETA?s problem is a lack of perspective. Animals should be treated as
humanely as possible, but you can?t attribute actual rights to them. At
best, you can outline responsibilities their owners have. In the end
they?re just critters. Human welfare is much more important.

What can I say? I love animals. They?re entertaining and they taste
great. Especially on a Killer Burger.

On Friday, June 25, 2004, I set about to  put together a radio show that I 
have done live at the Reno Hilton for the past  11 months on KPTT 630 Radio, a 
local ESPN affiliate.  The Reno Rodeo was to have its  next-to-the-last 
performance in town on this date to record crowds.  Thinking that the subject was 
very  topical and thought-provoking, I did some research about how animals are 
treated  in rodeos across the country.  I  stumbled across a website at 
_http://www.sharkonline.org/_ (http://www.sharkonline.org/) . 
I learned of  documented abuse and mistreatment of animals in rodeos, and 
wanted to find out  more, as well as hear from both sides.  I telephoned the 
owner of the website, Steve Hindi, and invited him on  the show.  I then learned 
that the  animal welfare coordinator for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys 
Association, Cindy  Schonholtz, happen to be in town and I was able to track her down 
and invite her  onto the show.  She immediately  agreed to appear in person 
on the show, and got directions on how to get  there.  I then informed her that 
I  would also have Steve Hindi from SHARK (Showing Animals Respect &amp; 
Kindness)  on the show with her. 
At this point she  started backpedaling and told me that she would have to 
clear it with her  superiors at the PRCA.  Within an  hour, she called back and 
canceled her appearance.  I then got a call from my boss, General  Manager 
Dane Wilt of Lotus Radio in  Reno, who was very upset.  He demanded to know whose 
idea it was to  put an animal rights activist on the air.  I should point out 
here that Lotus Radio has 5 radio stations in Reno,  including 94.5 The 
Mountain, a country FM station, which turns out to be the  official radio station 
of the Reno Rodeo for the past 4 years running.  Since Miss Schonholtz had just 
canceled  and I wanted to have both sides on the air, coupled with the fact 
that Dane was  very upset, I told him that I wouldn't put Mr. Hindi on the air 
and he hung  up. 
First thing Monday  morning, Dane called me into his office.  He also 
requested the presence of office manager Tammy Jo Baxter, as he  often does when very 
serious conversations are about to take place.  He started out this way "Lee, 
there is  absolutely no possible way that you can justify what you did on 
Friday.  The rodeo is our partner.  You have shown no regard for our  
relationship with them, etc, etc.  You will never be on the air on KPTT again.  Ever." 
I then tried to  explain my reasons for doing the show to no avail.  I even 
apologized, saying I used poor  judgment by not consulting with him first.  He 
was determined to remove me from the air, saying that my apology was  
worthless because it didn't come fast enough.  He went on to say that he couldn't 
trust  me to be on the air ever again.  Since I am also the sales manager of KPTT, 
I asked how he could trust me  to call on clients if he couldn't trust me to 
be on the air.  He said that that was different, and I  disagreed.  I told him 
then that if  he really didn't trust me, I didn't need to be there, and so I 
resigned.  I reminded him that all of this fuss was  over a show that NEVER 
EVEN AIRED.  It didn't matter.  He wasn't changing his mind, so I  assured him 
that I was serious about resigning. 
Since this occurred,  I have informed a few of my clients about what 
happened, and they are furious,  some already demanding answers and threatening to 
cancel many thousands of  dollars worth of advertising.  The  Reno Hilton is also 
a rodeo partner, but they have supported me.  Their President &amp; CEO Tim 
Maland has  been very understanding.  We are  negotiating putting my show on 
another station.

TO SATISFY THE PUBLIC'S ever-growing appetite for meat, slaughterhouses
in the United States killed ten billion animals last year. That's
27,397,260 animals every day, 1,141,553 every hour, 19,026 every minute.
Most Americans, largely disconnected from their food supply, assume
these animals met a painless end, if they think about it at all. Even
readers of books and articles about conditions in factory farms may not
be aware of what happens to animals at slaughter. But every now and then
that reality flashes briefly across the public consciousness, as it did
during last year's news stories about mad cow disease, when television
viewers glimpsed a sick cow being dragged along the ground to a
slaughterhouse. The media attention was on food safety, not the welfare
of the animals, but for a brief moment the veil had been lifted on the
brutality of the process that turns living creatures into meat.

And why should anyone want to inquire further? Can't we just assume that
the same industry that maximizes profits by confinement so extreme that
chickens can't flap their wings and pigs are prevented from turning
around will also routinely mistreat animals at slaughter? What sense is
there in focusing on the final hours of animals whose entire short lives
are often a study in misery?

Mohandas Gandhi said that a nation's moral progress can be judged by the
way it treats its animals. Animal behavior scientists have proven
unequivocally that animals are not machines but sentient beings that
experience feelings of pain, fear, anxiety, and despair. These feelings
matter to the animal and they should matter to us. If Gandhi is right,
we have an obligation to know what happens to animals when they are
killed to feed us, and to let that knowledge inform our actions. Yet
from early childhood, Americans are taught to dissociate picture-book
scenes of cows and sheep grazing in a pasture from rows of
plastic-wrapped cuts of meat lining grocer's shelves. We eat "pork" not
pigs, "veal" not baby cows. Animals aren't killed in slaughterhouses but
"processed" in "packing plants."

        <docText>Facts worth knowing: Sand and bath houses

Facts worth knowing

Sand and dust bath

Chinchillas have a soft, dense fur which is usually
bluish-grey. This fur insulates against the extreme dry cold of the Andes where they originally come from. Chinchillas need a daily bath in special sand to take care of their soft fur. The best
sand-qualities are: Spanish Sand, Attapulgus and Blue Cloud. Don't use sand which contains quartz, silicone or traces of limestone. The bath-tub for your Chinchilla has to be big enough so that your
little rodent is able to roll about. A big bowl or something like a cat's tray are a good choice. You can also buy one of those chinchilla bath houses (available at Chinworld.com and other online
shops).Take a look at the following photos to see some types of these &#x201e;Chinchilla-bath-tubs.

... A place with no cages, where all the chinchillas frolic happily on a superior replica of the Andes mountains. It's always pleasantly cool with a soft breeze that circulates the scent of delectables served at the Roadstop Raisin Lounges that dot the landscape: clear, cold water, a variety of fragrant hays, dried fruit, herbs and unsweetened Wheat 'N Bran mini Shredded Wheat biscuits , every tantalizing treat imaginable. And eat all you want, in Heaven you won't get the runs! Naturally, all the clouds are sprinkled with Blue Sparkle Dust for unlimited celestial dustbathing.

        <docText>What's a Chin? Plu-eeeeeze people!

This is from Lyn Duedall's most excellent chin website at

"With so many chinchillas living in pet stores, zoos and people's homes, it seems somewhat ironic that people still ask what is it? One may describe this animal as looking similar to a chubby squirrel with big ears or having a rabbit's body with large mouse-like ears and a squirrel's tail. However, the fact remains that they are a rodent! (see photos)

Chinchilla means "little chinta" a name given by the Indian tribes in their area. The chinchilla is from South America, more specifically in the countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and Chile in the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. Their scientific name is Chinchilla lanigera, which means long-tailed chinchilla. Their class is Mammalia (Mammals), their order Rodentia (Rodents), and their family is called the Chinchillidae (Chinchillas and Visachas). "

        <docText>Pet fad

Chinchilla have become the latest "fad pet" especially in Los Angeles. Please, please, people be careful with these innocent, dear things!

See the whole article below at Susan Daffron's Pet Tails

Fad Pets

by Susan Daffron

Times and styles change. But wanting to look cool or following the latest fashion is the wrong reason to get any kind of animal. Shelters still occasionally get calls from people who bought a pot bellied pig during the craze of the late 80s and early 90s. Their cute little piglet has now turned into a 100-150 pound pig and is acting like one as well. Most shelters (the Panhandle Animal Shelter included) won't take exotic animals, so at that point many people find their own less humane ways of "getting rid" of the problem.

These pet fads aren't limited to types of animals, such as iguanas and pot bellied pigs either. Certain breeds of companion animals come into and go out of style as well. After Disney released 101 Dalmatians, shelters were inundated with lots of cute spotted dogs...

        <docText>Free Jeffrey Luers by David Rovics

I grew up in the land of houses in rows
I had asthma, that's how it goes
When you're in LA and there are cars everywhere
See the sky and smell the air
I left home, looked around
Trying to find some solid ground
I found life in the northern wood
And I knew that this was good
I saw the dozers, the death machines
Tearing apart everything green
I built a platform, sat in a tree
Said if you're taking her down, then you're taking down me
I saw the highways, I saw the mall
I saw the eagle, heard the clarion call
Voices of reason were talking to me
So I burned down a couple of SUV's
23 years, 23 years
Among the words and the deeds in the war for the west
A chapter was written and I was the test
To shut us all up and drive us apart
All who have life and love in our hearts
The judge did the math then he did some more
He was a man out to settle a score
An illegal sentence in a stolen land
With life or death in the palm of his hand
23 years, 23 years
And now here I am, so long behind bars
For trying to breath in a nation of cars
Sanity jailed and madness in power
Our time it is short and now is the hour
So may you hide in the darkness and stay safe in the night
Find whatever you need to stay in the fight
There's a planet at stake and that's all that I see
And my thoughts will be with you until I am free
23 years, 23 years

With the farm and other stuff...sorry I haven't posted in a while. New Chinsurrections coming soon. Thanks to those who have left the supportive comments -- my friends, Collie, Faron, Hermes, and Swami Bhagavatam know that I'm pretty fanatical about animal rights and if people can see the idiocy of their ways through cartoons, so be it!

Wear something other than a healthy animal

Anti-Fur Season Begins
Annual fall anti fur actions began in Toronto today with a small Boycott the Bay Demo at Queen and Yonge. The public was receptive to the action, though a few hostile people appeared.

Basic Facts On the Fur Industry
- About 1.1 million animals--raccoons, coyotes, bobcats, lynxes, foxes, beavers, otters, and others-are killed each year for their fur by trappers in Canada. Another 1.1 million animals are raised and killed in extremely cruel conditions on fur "farms."
- Trapping weakens wildlife populations by killing healthy animals.
- Canada's native people, as well as its wild animals, are victims of the fur industry.
- Every year, thousands of dogs, cats, raptors, and other so-called "trash" animals (including endangered species like the bald eagle) are crippled or killed by traps.

The Great Deception

Chins were almost killed off by fur trappers in South America. Fortunately, they were brought back from the edge of extinction by laws in those countries that have tried to protect them. The Great Hoax, however, persists that MF Chapman single handedly saved the chinchilla by importing some into the US. Chapman was a tool of the FUR INDUSTRY!

See Chincare for the real scoop.

It's just incredible how badly people treat these poor animals. Everyone from rich little kids who have no clue how to care for their new living little fad pet, to the fur industry who put dead animal skins on the backs of rich movie stars and socialites, to all the pet shops who leave poor things to die in their back rooms, and now, the trappers are back in South America. Don't ask how I know, I just do.

Largest Animal Seizure in RSPCA Historyby Sherry Morse

England&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) has rescued 269 animals in what it described as the largest seizure in its 181 year history.

The animals, which included a rabbit, a chinchilla, seven cats, 16 parrots and 244 dogs, were removed from a three bedroom house in Carnforth, Lancashire in Northern England on September 10.

The animals were living everywhere in the house including the loft and the basement.

...

It took 26 people two days to remove all the animals from the house, which one source described as being in an "absolutely, and utterly, disgusting" condition.
...

The rescued birds included African grays, macaws, and Amazon parrots.

See the Buzzle editorial.
and Gray's are freakin' expensive, too...

Canned Hunts

People drive me insane sometimes....
In the last twenty years, the number of hunters in the United States has declined, but the amount of money hunters are spending has increased dramatically according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Fund for Animals. One result of these trends is the emergence of "canned hunts" in many states across America. The Fund for Animals estimates that since 1980 nearly 2000 hunting preserves have opened, with 500 in Texas alone. These hunts are conducted on private land stocked with exotic animals, such as zebras, antelope, rams, and even the occasional lion. Hunters pay thousands of dollars to spend a few days tracking and killing these animals, and most ranches guarantee hunters will not go home empty handed. To further favor hunters, most canned hunt ranches either fence animals into small areas or train animals to eat from the same spot each day, according to the Fund for Animals' report "Canned Hunts: Unfair at Any Price".

        <docText>Project ChinChorro

The wildlife project &#x201c;ChinChorro&#x201d;

Picture: the project&#x2019;s coat of arms

The fur trade, motivated by economic interests, has forced the
Chinchilla lanigera to the brink of extinction. The wild populations were harvested over a prolonged period of time at a higher rate than the species' reproduction rate. So the extensive human-caused mortality has
to be added to the natural mortality factors. Furthermore the people living in the urbane surroundings were not interested in protecting the species due to the reason that these was for no interest, neither personal
nor economic, for them. Even today most of the people living near the RNC (Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas) have never seen a chinchilla.
The German-Chilean project ChinChorro was therefore founded to teach young
students of the near the reserve located town Illapel (Chile) about the chinchillas to increase future's chance of success that the those students will have a personal interest protecting an animal which is
about to extinct. Another target is to teach the students to respect the natural environment as we all depend on it.

(Photo: The ChinChorro students, the Chilean leader of the group Laura Araya Sols and a volunteer from the University of Chile, Wladimir Givovich Diaz, in September 2004.)

The number of students taking part in the project is now 15. In September 27 students had their
first classes about the wild living chinchillas to be well prepared during their first excursion to the RNC. Near the reserve CONAF (National Chilean Forrest Service) had reserved a place in
order to make it possible for the students to plant about 3000 native seedlings. By planting native seed stock they will learn more about the region's nature, CONAF's co-workers are
willing to teach them about the importance of those plants animals living in the reserve depend on.
The students are very motivated. They suggested to work on a regular paper for the students at
their school, also they want to teach other students about the wild chinchillas as soon as they are well educated about chinchillas.

As there is a urgent need for the reserve to grow because of the existence of colonies of wild living chinchillas outside the protected area where mining and human settlement endanger the
animals it is also our target to motivate tourists to come to Chile in order to spend their holidays in the region around the reserve. An English teacher will be able to guide those environmental
tourists who are interested in a special kind of vacation, and a nearby located travel agency is interested in a increasing number of tourists. A soft natural tourism can cause a positive
influence for both, the reserve and the people living near the reserve.

Chinchillas are 25 cm (10 inches) long (not including the tail). Females are larger than males. Large, round eyes and excellent hearing make
it possible for them to detect predators like little mammals and birds of prey. They have long whiskers and a bushy tail which is one-third the length of the entire body. Large hind feet enable them to hop around with great agility. The
chinchilla sleeps in rock crevices or burrows by day. It also escapes into tiny crevices where predators cannot reach. Nowadays most chinchillas live in captivity because they are almost extinct in their original range.

Chinchilla laniger, Order Rodentia

A female has approximately two litters per year. Newborn chinchillas are weaned at 8 weeks and independent at 12
weeks.

The average life span is 15-20 years in captivitiy.

Chinchilla Garden Houses

There was an article about the chinchilla garden
houses you can see below (more photos to come) in the German magazin &#x201c;Ein Herz fr Tiere&#x201d; in August 2002. Sorry ... Detailed information about the chin houses can be found in &#x201c;Das groe
Chinchilla-Handbuch&#x201d;, a German book for owners of pet chinchilla, only. For those of you who are able to speak German: The book is available at www.amazon.de

A view through the window of the smaller chinchilla garden house: Chinchilla Schneewittchen and chinchilla Blacky (on the right) are discovering their garden house.

&#x201c;Hhmmm ... treats!&#x201d;

Chinchilla Inti sitting on her favourite place in the big chinchilla garden house.

Chinchilla Inti (in front) and chinchilla Knuffel like to take a look out of the window to watch &#x201c;their&#x201d; humans or to observe the cheeky birds and hedgehogs in the garden. ;-)

= This is a part of the left side of the chinny garden house. Chinchilla Schneewittchen was sitting on a transport box while chinchilla Blacky looked for something to eat ... :-)

Facts worth knowing

Interview with G. Kelterbaum, member of a German society for the prevention of the cruelty
to animals &#x201c;Straenkatzen Kln e.V.&#x201d; (Streetcats of Cologne) about the problems of castration

Question: Do pet owners prefer to castrate the male part of a pair or not?Answer: Most of them think that a castration is too expensive even if they know that the procurement of a young one will cause problems later. You pay approx. 35,- DM (17,50 Euro) for a rabbit at a petshop ..., a castration costs double. If the price of a castration is higher than the price of the pet itself the will to castrate the pet declines.
Question: Have you made simular experiences with chinchilla owners?Answer: Many owners of a chinchilla say they do not want to keep (their children) back from the experience of the event of a natural process of reproduction. Under the pretence it would be better to let nature do what nature wants some of them start breeding chinchillas. But it is the chase after money and not the interest of the breeding-animals wich is more important for them.
Question: For what reason do exspecially chinchilla owners refuse a castration of their pet?Answer: Some owners lost their chinchilla because of a castration and therefore they are convinced that a chinchilla has not the slightest chance to survive the operation. We always stress that anaesthetic is a risk for every animal (like it is for every human being). In fact, chinchillas are more endangered during this operation than many other animals. But every male which had been castrated by a veterinarian we chose did survive. If you do not trust the veterinarian who is located next you have to choose someone who has already made experiences with the castration of chinchillas.

Thank you for this interview!

Schneewittchen is 11 years old now. She is a cheeky little Wilson White.

Flocke, almost 5 years old, best friend of Alf. Flocke was very sad due to the loss of Alf ... until Quiddel
became his new companion. I lost Flocke due to a dental disease in November 2004. I miss you, Flocke!

Alf,17 years old, an extremely friendly chin, he had a character to die for... I lost
him in October 2002. He will be unforgetable.
