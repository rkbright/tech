			Following the structure and aims of Eyrolles' “Administrator's Handbook” collection, this book revolves around a case study providing both support and illustration for all topics being addressed.

			This book has its own website, which hosts whatever elements that can make it more useful. In particular, it includes an online version of the book with clickable links, and possible errata.

			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></span> focuses on a non-technical presentation of the Debian project and describes its goals and organization. These aspects are important because they define a general framework that others chapters will complete with more concrete information.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapters 2 and 3</strong></span> provide a broad outline of the case study. At this point, novice readers can take the time to read <span class="strong strong"><strong>appendix B</strong></span>, where they'll find a short remedial course explaining a number of basic computing notions, as well as concepts inherent to any Unix system.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			To get on with our real subject matter, we will quite naturally start with the installation process (<span class="strong strong"><strong>chapter 4</strong></span>); <span class="strong strong"><strong>chapters 5 and 6</strong></span> will unveil basic tools that any Debian administrator will use, such as those of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>APT</strong></span> family, which is largely responsible for the distribution's excellent reputation. These chapters are in no way reserved to professionals, since everyone is their own administrator at home.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></span> will be an important parenthesis; it describes workflows to efficiently use documentation and to quickly gain an understanding of problems in order to solve them.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			The next chapters will be a more detailed tour of the system, starting with basic infrastructure and services (<span class="strong strong"><strong>chapters 8 to 10</strong></span>) and going progressively up the stack to reach the user applications in <span class="emphasis"><em>chapter 13</em></span>. <span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 12</strong></span> deals with more advanced subjects that will most directly concern administrators of large sets of computers (including servers), while <span class="strong strong"><strong>chapter 14</strong></span> is a brief introduction to the wider subject of computer security and gives a few keys to avoid most problems.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 15</strong></span> is for administrators who want to go further and create their own Debian packages.
		</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>VOCABULARY</em></span> Debian package</h6></div></div></div><a id="idm4120" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm3416" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm2712" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm2008" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
			A Debian package is an archive containing all the files required to install a piece of software. It is generally a file with a <code class="filename">.deb</code> extension, and it can be handled with the <code class="command">dpkg</code> command. Also called <span class="emphasis"><em>binary package</em></span>, it contains files that can be directly used (such as programs or documentation). On the other hand, a <span class="emphasis"><em>source package</em></span> contains the source code for the software and the instructions required for building the binary package.

			The present English version is based on the fifth edition of the French book. This fifth edition was an important update, covering version 6.0 of Debian, code-named <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span>. Among the changes, Debian now sports two new architectures — <span class="emphasis"><em>kfreebsd-i386</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>kfreebsd-amd64</em></span> — based on the FreeBSD kernel and supporting the associated technologies (<span class="emphasis"><em>jails</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>packet filter</em></span> and so on). On Linux-based architectures, the 2.6.32 kernel extends support to all the main virtualization technologies (Xen/OpenVZ/LXC/KVM, see <a class="xref" href="sect.virtualization.html">Section 12.2, “Virtualization”</a>). All included packages have obviously been updated. Many improvements specifically target package maintainers, who can now use a simplified <code class="filename">debian/rules</code> (with debhelper's <code class="command">dh</code> command); they also benefit from a standard patch management system integrated to <code class="command">dpkg-source</code> (by using the <code class="literal">3.0 (quilt)</code> source package format).

			We have added some notes and remarks in sidebars. They have a variety of roles: they can draw attention to a difficult point, complete a notion of the case study, define some terms, or serve as reminders. Here is a list of the most common of these sidebars:
		</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					BACK TO BASICS: a reminder for some information that is supposed to be known;
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					VOCABULARY: defines a technical term, sometimes Debian specific;
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					COMMUNITY: highlights important persons or roles within the project;
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					POLICY: a rule or recommendation from the Debian Policy. This document is essential within the project, and describes how to package software. The parts of policy highlighted in this book bring direct benefits to users (for example, knowing that the policy standardizes the location of documentation and examples makes it easy to find them even in a new package).
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					TOOL: presents a relevant tool or service;
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					IN PRACTICE: theory and practice do not always match; these sidebars contain advice resulting from our experience. They can also give detailed and concrete examples;
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
					other more or less frequent sidebars are rather explicit: CULTURE, TIP, CAUTION, GOING FURTHER, SECURITY, and so on.
