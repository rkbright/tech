		Linux has been garnering strength for the last few years, and its growing popularity drives more and more users to make the jump. The first step on that path is to pick a distribution. This is an important decision, because each distribution has its own peculiarities, and future migration costs can be avoided if the right choice is made from the start.

		Strictly speaking, Linux is only a kernel, the core piece of software sitting between the hardware and the applications.
	</div><div class="para"><p></p>
		A “Linux distribution” is a full operating system; it usually includes the Linux kernel, an installer program, and most importantly applications and other software required to turn a computer into an actually useful tool.
	</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
		Debian GNU/Linux is a “generic” Linux distribution that fits most users. The purpose of this book is to show its many aspects so you can make an informed decision when choosing.

			Most Linux distributions are backed by a for-profit company that develops them and sells them under some kind of commercial scheme. Examples include <span class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu</em></span>, mainly developed by <span class="emphasis"><em>Canonical Ltd.</em></span>; <span class="emphasis"><em>Mandriva Linux</em></span>, by French company <span class="emphasis"><em>Mandriva SA</em></span>; and <span class="emphasis"><em>Suse Linux</em></span>, maintained and made commercially available by <span class="emphasis"><em>Novell</em></span>.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			At the other end of the spectrum lie the likes of Debian and the Apache Software Foundation (which hosts the development for the Apache web server). Debian is above all a project in the Free Software world, implemented by volunteers working together through the Internet.

			Linux has gathered a fair amount of media coverage, which mostly benefits the distributions supported by a real marketing department — in other words, to company-backed distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Suse, Mandriva, and so on). But Debian is far from being a marginal distribution; according to a German study made in early 2009, Debian is the most widely used distribution on servers (with nearly half of the responding companies having at least one Debian server), and the second most widely deployed on desktops (right behind Ubuntu, which is a Debian derivative). <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Eingesetzte-Produkte-224518.html">http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Eingesetzte-Produkte-224518.html</a></div>

			The purpose of this book is to help you discover this distribution. We hope to share the experience we've gathered since we joined the project as developers and contributors in 1998 (Raphaël) and 2000 (Roland). With any luck, our enthusiasm will be communicative, and maybe you'll join us sometime…

			The first edition of this book (in 2004) served to fill a gaping hole: it was the first French-language book that focused exclusively on Debian. At that time, many other books were written on the topic both for French-speaking and English-speaking readers. Unfortunately almost none of them got updated, and today we again find ourselves in a situation where there are very few good books on Debian. We truly hope that this first English edition will fill this gap and help many users.
