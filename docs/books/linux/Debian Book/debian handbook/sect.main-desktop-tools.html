					Evolution is the GNOME email client and can be installed with <code class="command">apt-get install evolution</code>. Evolution goes beyond a simple email client, and also provides a calendar, an address book, a task list, and a memo (free-form note) application. Its email component includes a powerful message indexing system, and allows for the creation of virtual folders based on search queries on all archived messages. In other words, all messages are stored the same way but displayed in a folder-based organization, each folder containing messages that match a set of filtering criteria.

				Many users will no doubt be surprised by the absence of Mozilla Firefox in the Debian <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> menus. No need to panic: the <span class="pkg pkg">iceweasel</span> package contains Iceweasel, which is basically Firefox under another name.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The rationale behind this renaming is a result of the usage rules imposed by the Mozilla Foundation on the <span class="trademark">Firefox</span>™ registered trademark: any software named Firefox must use the official Firefox logo and icons. However, since these elements are not released under a free license, Debian cannot distribute them in its <span class="emphasis"><em>main</em></span> section. Rather than moving the whole browser to <span class="emphasis"><em>non-free</em></span>, the package maintainer chose to use a different name.

				Netscape Navigator was the standard browser when the web started reaching the masses, but it was progressively left behind when Microsoft Internet Explorer came around. Faced with this failure, Netscape (the company) decided to “free” its source code, by realeasing it under a free license, to give it a second life. This was the beginning of the Mozilla project. After many years of development, the results are more than satisfying: the Mozilla project brought forth an HTML rendering engine (called Gecko) that is among the most standard-compliant. This rendering engine is in particular used by the Mozilla Firefox browser, which is one of the most successful browsers, with a fast-growing user base.

				<span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> also brings a relative newcomer on the web browser scene, Chromium (available in the <span class="pkg pkg">chromium-browser</span> package). This browser is developed by Google at such a fast pace that maintaining a single version of it across the whole lifespan of Debian <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> is unlikely to be possible. Its clear purpose is to make web services more attractive, both by optimizing the browser for performance and by increasing the user's security. The free code that powers Chromium is also used by its proprietary version called Google Chrome.

					When setting up an internal instant messaging system for a company, the obvious choice is Jabber: its protocol is an open standard (XMPP), and there is no shortage of features. The messages can be encrypted, which can be a real bonus, and gateways can be set up between a Jabber server and other instant messaging networks such as ICQ, GAIM, Yahoo, MSN, and so on.

					IRC can also be considered, instead of Jabber. This system is more centered around the concept of channels, the name of which starts with a hash sign <code class="literal">#</code>. Each channel is usually targeted at a specific topic and any number of people can join a channel to discuss it (but users can still have in one-to-one private conversations if needed). The IRC protocol is older, and does not allow end-to-end encryption of the messages; it is still possible to encrypt the communications between the users and the server by tunneling the IRC protocol inside SSL.
				</div><a id="idp11421448" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp11421928" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					IRC clients are a bit more complex, and they usually provide many features that are of limited use in a corporate environment. For instance, channel “operators” are users endowed with the ability to kick other users from a channel, or even ban them permanently, when the normal discussion is disrupted.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Since the IRC protocol is very old, many clients are available to cater for many user groups; examples include XChat and Smuxi (graphical clients based on GTK+), Irssi (text mode), Erc (integrated to Emacs), Chatzilla (in the Mozilla software suite), and so on.

					Ekiga (formerly GnomeMeeting) is the most prominent application for Linux video conferencing. It is both stable and functional, and is very easily used on a local network; setting up the service on a global network is much more complex when the firewalls involved lack explicit support for the H323 and/or SIP teleconferencing protocols with all their quirks.
				</div><a id="idp11424736" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp11425200" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					If only one Ekiga client is to run behind the firewall, the configuration is rather straightforward, and only involves forwarding a few ports to the dedicated host: TCP port 1720 (listening for incoming connections), TCP port 5060 (for SIP), TCP ports 30000 to 30010 (for control of open connections) and UDP ports 5000 to 5013 (for audio and video data transmission and registration to an H323 proxy).

						Setting up a Jabber server is rather straightforward. After installing the <span class="pkg pkg">ejabberd</span> package, executing <code class="command">dpkg-reconfigure ejabberd</code> will allow customizing the default domain, and create an administrator account. Note that the Jabber server needs a valid DNS name to point at it, so some network administration can be required beforehand. The Falcot Corp administrators picked <code class="literal">jabber.falcot.com</code> for that purpose.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Once this initial set up is over, the service configuration can be controlled through a web interface accessible at <code class="literal">http://jabber.falcot.com:5280/admin/</code>.

Note that the username must be qualified with the configured domain: the <code class="literal">admin</code> account becomes <code class="literal">admin@jabber.falcot.com</code>.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>

					FusionForge is a collaborative development tool with some ancestry in SourceForge, a hosting service for free software projects. It takes the same overall approach based on the standard development model for free software. The software itself has kept evolving after the SourceForge code went proprietary. Its initial authors, VA Software, decided not to release any more free versions. The same happened again when the first fork (GForge) followed the same path. Since various people and organizations have participated in development, the current FusionForge also includes features targeting a more traditional approach to development, as well as projects not purely concerned with software development.
				</div><a id="idp11438368" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					FusionForge can be seen as an amalgamation of several tools dedicated to manage, track and coordinate projects. These tools can be roughly classified into three families:
				</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<span class="emphasis"><em>communication</em></span>: web forums, mailing-list manager, announcement system allowing a project to publish news;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<span class="emphasis"><em>tracking</em></span>: task tracker to control progress and schedule tasks, trackers for bugs (or patches or feature requests, or any other kind of “ticket”), surveys;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<span class="emphasis"><em>sharing</em></span>: documentation manager to provide a single central point for documents related to a project, generic file release manager, dedicated website for each project.
						</div></li></ul></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Since FusionForge is largely targeting development projects, it also integrates many tools such as CVS, Subversion, Git, Bazaar, Darcs, Mercurial and Arch for source control management or “configuration management” or “version control” — this process has many names. These programs keep an history of all the revisions of all tracked files (often source code files), with all the changes they go through, and they can merge modifications when several developers work simultaneously on the same part of a project.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Most of these tools are accessible, or even managed, through a web interface, with a fine-grained permission system, and email notifications for some events.

				Office software has long been seen as lacking in the free software world. Users have long asked for replacements for Microsoft tools such as Word and Excel, but these are so complex that replacements were hard to develop. The situation changed when the OpenOffice.org project started (following Sun's release of the StarOffice code under a free license). The GNOME and KDE projects are still working on their offerings (GNOME Office and KOffice), and the friendly competition leads to interesting results. For instance, the Gnumeric spreadsheet (part of GNOME Office) is even better than OpenOffice.org in some domains, notably the precision of its calculations. On the word processing front, the OpenOffice.org suite still leads the way.

				Another important feature for users is the ability to import Word and Excel documents received from contacts or found in archives. Even though all office suites have filters which allow working on these formats, only the ones found in OpenOffice.org are functional enough for daily use.
