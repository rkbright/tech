				A symbolic link is a pointer to another file. When you access it, the file to which it points is opened. Removal of the link will not cause deletion of the file to which it points. Likewise, it does not have its own set of permissions, but rather retains the permissions of its target. Finally, it can point to any type of file: directories, special files (sockets, named pipes, device files, etc.), even other symbolic links.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The <code class="command">ln -s <em class="replaceable"><code>target</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>link-name</code></em></code> command creates a symbolic link, named <em class="replaceable"><code>link-name</code></em>, pointing to <em class="replaceable"><code>target</code></em>.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				If the target does not exist, then the link is “broken” and accessing it will result in an error indicating that the target file does not exist. If the link points to another link, you will have a “chain” of links that turns into a “cycle” if one of the targets points to one of its predecessors. In this case, accessing one of the links in the cycle will result in a specific error (“too many levels of symbolic links”); this means the kernel gave up after several rounds of the cycle.

				The timezone, configured during initial installation, is a configuration item for the <span class="pkg pkg">tzdata</span> package. To modify it, use the <code class="command">dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</code> command, which allows you to choose the timezone to be used in an interactive manner (until <span class="distribution distribution">lenny</span>, the command to use was <code class="command">tzconfig</code>). Its configuration is stored in the <code class="filename">/etc/timezone</code> file. Additionally, the corresponding file in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> directory is copied in <code class="filename">/etc/localtime</code>; this file contains the rules governing the dates where daylight saving time is active, for countries that use it.

				There are two time sources in a computer. A computer's motherboard has a hardware clock, called the “CMOS clock”. This clock is not very precise, and provides rather slow access times. The operating system kernel has its own, the software clock, which it keeps up to date with its own means (possibly with the help of time servers, see the “Time Synchronization” section). This system clock is generally more accurate, especially since it doesn't need access to hardware variables. However, since it only exists in live memory, it is zeroed out every time the machine is booted, contrary to the CMOS clock, which has a battery and therefores “survives” rebooting or halting of the machine. The system clock is, thus, set from the CMOS clock during boot, and the CMOS clock is updated on shutdown (to take into account possible changes or corrections if it has been improperly adjusted).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				In practice, there is a problem, since the CMOS clock is nothing more than a counter and contains no information regarding the time zone. There is a choice to make regarding its interpretation: either the system considers it runs in universal time (UTC, formerly GMT), or in local time. This choice could be a simple shift, but things are actually more complicated: as a result of daylight saving time, this offset is not constant. The result is that the system has no way to determine whether the offset is correct, especially around periods of time change. Since it is always possible to reconstruct local time from universal time and the timezone information, we strongly recommend using the CMOS clock in universal time.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Unfortunately, Windows systems in their default configuration ignore this recommendation; they keep the CMOS clock on local time, applying time changes when booting the computer by trying to guess during time changes if the change has already been applied or not. This works relatively well, as long as the system has only Windows running on it. But when a computer has several systems (whether it be a “dual-boot” configuration or running other systems via virtual machine), chaos ensues, with no means to determine if the time is correct. If you absolutely must retain Windows on a computer, you should either configure it to keep the CMOS clock as UTC, or deactivate <code class="literal">UTC</code> in the <code class="filename">/etc/default/rcS</code> file on the Debian system (and make sure to manually check your clock in spring and autumn).

				Time synchronization, which may seem superfluous on a computer, is very important on a network. Since users do not have permissions allowing them to modify the date and time, it is important for this information to be precise to prevent confusion. Furthermore, having all of the computers on a network synchronized allows better cross-referencing of information from logs on different machines. Thus, in the event of an attack, it is easier to reconstruct the chronological sequence of actions on the various machines involved in the compromise. Data collected on several machines for statistical purposes won't make a great deal of sense if they are not synchronized.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> NTP</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp10557616" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10558096" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				NTP (Network Time Protocol) allows a machine to synchronize with others fairly accurately, taking into consideration the delays induced by the transfer of information over the network and other possible offsets.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				While there are numerous NTP servers on the Internet, the more popular ones may be overloaded. This is why we recommend using the <span class="emphasis"><em>pool.ntp.org</em></span> NTP server, which is, in reality, a group of machines that have agreed to serve as public NTP servers. You could even limit use to a sub-group specific to a country, with, for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>us.pool.ntp.org</em></span> for the United States, or <span class="emphasis"><em>ca.pool.ntp.org</em></span> for Canada, etc.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				However, if you manage a large network, it is recommended that you install your own NTP server, which will synchronize with the public servers. In this case, all the other machines on your network can use your internal NTP server instead of increasing the load on the public servers. You will also increase homogeneity with your clocks, since all the machines will be synchronized on the same source, and this source is very close in terms of network transfer times.
			</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section.ntp-stations-travail">8.9.2.1. For Workstations</h4></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Since work stations are regularly rebooted (even if only to save energy), synchronizing them by NTP at boot is enough. To do so, simply install the <span class="pkg pkg">ntpdate</span> package. You can change the NTP server used if needed by modifying the <code class="filename">/etc/default/ntpdate</code> file.
				</div><a id="idp10562928" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10563488" class="indexterm"></a></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section.ntp-serveurs">8.9.2.2. For Servers</h4></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Servers are only rarely rebooted, and it is very important for their system time to be correct. To permanently maintain correct time, you would install a local NTP server, a service offered in the <span class="pkg pkg">ntp</span> package. In its default configuration, the server will synchronize with <span class="emphasis"><em>pool.ntp.org</em></span> and provide time in response to requests coming from the local network. You can configure it by editing the <code class="filename">/etc/ntp.conf</code> file, the most significant alteration being the NTP server to which it refers. If the network has a lot of servers, it may be interesting to have one local time server which synchronizes with the public servers and is used as a time source by the other servers of the network.
				</div><a id="idp10566360" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10567072" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10567792" class="indexterm"></a><div class="sidebar fil"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>GOING FURTHER</em></span> GPS modules and other time sources</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp10569192" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10569672" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					If time synchronization is particularly crucial to your network, it is possible to equip a server with a GPS module (which will use the time from GPS satellites) or a DCF-77 module (which will sync time with the atomic clock near Frankfurt, Germany). In this case, the configuration of the NTP server is a little more complicated, and prior consultation of the documentation is an absolute necessity.

				Log files can grow, fast, and it is necessary to archive them. The most common scheme is a rotating archive: the log file is regularly archived, and only the latest <em class="replaceable"><code>X</code></em> archives are retained. <code class="command">logrotate</code>, the program responsible for these rotations, follows directives given in the <code class="filename">/etc/logrotate.conf</code> file and all of the files in the <code class="filename">/etc/logrotate.d/</code> directory. The administrator may modify these files, if they wish to adapt the log rotation policy defined by Debian. The <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">logrotate</span>(1)</span> man page describes all of the options available in these configuration files. You may want to increase the number of files retained in log rotation, or move the log files to a specific directory dedicated to archiving them rather than delete them. You could also send them by e-mail to archive them elsewhere.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The <code class="command">logrotate</code> program is executed daily by the <code class="command">cron</code> scheduling program (described in <a class="xref" href="sect.task-scheduling-cron-atd.html">Section 9.7, “Scheduling Tasks with <code class="command">cron</code> and <code class="command">atd</code>”</a>).

				Frequently, several administrators work on the same network. Sharing the the root passwords is not very elegant, and opens the door for abuse due to the anonymity such sharing creates. The solution to this problem is the <code class="command">sudo</code> program, which allows certain users to execute certain commands with special rights. In the most common use case, <code class="command">sudo</code> allows a trusted user to execute any command as root. To do so, the user simply executes <code class="command">sudo <em class="replaceable"><code>command</code></em></code> and authenticates using their personal password.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				When installed, the <span class="pkg pkg">sudo</span> package doesn't give anyone any rights. To delegate such rights, the administrator must use the <code class="command">visudo</code> command, which allows them to modify the <code class="filename">/etc/sudoers</code> configuration file (here again, this will invoke the <code class="command">vi</code> editor, or any other editor indicated in the <code class="varname">EDITOR</code> environment variable). Adding a line with <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> ALL=(ALL) ALL</code> allows the user in question to execute any command as root.

				More sophisticated configurations allow authorization of only specific commands to specific users. All the details of the various possibilities are given in the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sudoers</span>(5)</span> man page.

				In a Unix-like system such as Debian, files are organized in a single tree-like hierarchy of directories. The <code class="filename">/</code> directory is called the “root directory”; all additional directories are sub-directories within this root. “Mounting” is the action of including the content of a peripheral device (often a hard drive) into the system's general file tree. As a consequence, if you use a separate hard drive to store users' personal data, this disk will have to be “mounted” in the <code class="filename">/home/</code> directory. The root filesystem is always mounted at boot by the kernel; other devices are often mounted later during the startup sequence or manually with the <code class="command">mount</code> command.
			</div><a id="idp10590080" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				Some removable devices are automatically mounted when connected, especially when using the GNOME, KDE or other graphical desktop environments. Others have to be mounted manually by the user. Likewise, they must be unmounted (removed from the file tree). Normal users do not usually have permission to execute the <code class="command">mount</code> and <code class="command">umount</code> commands. The administrator can, however, authorize these operations (independently for each mount point) by including the <code class="literal">user</code> option in the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The <code class="command">mount</code> command can be used without arguments (it then lists all mounted filesystems). The following parameters are required to mount or unmount a device. For the complete list, please refer to the corresponding man pages, <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span> and <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">umount</span>(8)</span>. For simple cases, the syntax is simple too: for example, to mount the <code class="filename">/dev/sdc1</code> partition, which has an ext3 filesystem, into the <code class="filename">/mnt/tmp/</code> directory, you would simply run <code class="command">mount -t ext3 /dev/sdc1 /mnt/tmp/</code>.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file gives a list of all possible mounts that happen either automatically on boot or manually for removable storage devices. Each mount point is described by a line with several space-separated fields:
