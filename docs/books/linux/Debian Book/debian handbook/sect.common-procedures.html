			The purpose of this section is to present some general tips on certain operations that an administrator will frequently have to perform. These procedures will of course not cover every possible case in an exhaustive way, but they may serve as starting points for the more difficult cases.
		</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>DISCOVERY</em></span> Documentation in French</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
			Often, documentation translated into a non-English language is available in a separate package with the name of the corresponding package, followed by <code class="literal">-<em class="replaceable"><code>lang</code></em></code> (where <em class="replaceable"><code>lang</code></em> is the two-letter ISO code for the language).
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			Thus, the <span class="emphasis"><em>apt-howto-fr</em></span> package contains the French translation of the howto for <span class="emphasis"><em>APT</em></span>. Likewise, the packages <span class="emphasis"><em>quick-reference-fr</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>debian-reference-fr</em></span> (Debian reference) are the French versions of the references guides for Debian (initially written in English by Osamu Aoki).
		</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp4795176">7.2.1. Configuring a Program</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp4795560" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp4796248" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				When you want to configure an unknown package, you must proceed in stages. First, you should read what the package maintainer has documented. Reading <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>/README.Debian</code> will indeed allow you to learn of specific provisions made to simplify the use of the software. It is sometimes essential in order to understand the differences from the original behavior of the program, as described in the general documentation, such as howtos. Sometimes this file also details the most common errors in order for you to avoid wasting time on common problems.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Then, you should look at the software's official documentation — refer to the previous section to identify the various existing documentation sources. The command <code class="command">dpkg -L <em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em></code> gives a list of files included in the package; you can therefore quickly identify the available documentation (as well as the configuration files, located in <code class="filename">/etc/</code>). <code class="command">dpkg -s <em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em></code> produces the package headers and shows any possible recommended or suggested packages; in there, you can find documentation or a utility that will ease the configuration of the software.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Finally, the configuration files are often self-documented by many explanatory comments detailing the various possible values for each configuration setting. So much so that it is sometimes enough to just choose a line to activate from among those available. In some cases, examples of configuration files are provided in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>/examples/</code> directory. They may serve as a basis for your own configuration file.
			</div><div class="sidebar fil"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>DEBIAN POLICY</em></span> Location of examples</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp12977456" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				All examples must be installed in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>/examples/</code> directory. This may be a configuration file, program source code (an example of the use of a library), or a data conversion script that the administrator can use in certain cases (such as to initialize a database). If the example is specific to a particular architecture, it should be installed in <code class="filename">/usr/lib/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>/examples/</code> and you should create a link pointing to that file in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>/examples/</code> directory.
			</div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp12980032">7.2.2. Monitoring What Daemons Are Doing</h3></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				A daemon somewhat complicates one's understanding of a situation, since it does not interact directly with the administrator. To check that a daemon is actually working, you need to test it. For example, to check the Apache (web server) daemon, test it with an HTTP request.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				To allow such tests, each daemon generally records everything that it does, as well as any errors that it encounters, in what are called “log files” or “system logs”. Logs are stored in <code class="filename">/var/log/</code> or one of its subdirectories. To know the precise name of a log file for each daemon, see its documentation. Note: a single test is not always sufficient if it does not cover all the possible usage cases; some problems only occur in particular circumstances.
			</div><div class="sidebar fil"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>TOOL</em></span> The <code class="command">rsyslogd</code> daemon</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp12982808" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp12983368" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp12984088" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				<code class="command">rsyslogd</code> is special: it collects logs (internal system messages) that are sent to it by other programs. Each log entry is associated with a subsystem (e-mail, kernel, authentication, etc.) and a priority, two bits of information that <code class="command">rsyslogd</code> processes to decide on what to do. The log message may be recorded in various log files, and/or sent to an administration console. The details are defined in the <code class="filename">/etc/rsyslog.conf</code> configuration file (documented in the manual page of the same name).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Certain C functions, which are specialized in sending logs, simplify the use of the <code class="command">rsyslogd</code> daemon. However some daemons manage their own log files (this is the case, for example, of <code class="command">samba</code>, that implements Windows shares on Linux).
			</div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> Daemon</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp12987736" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				A daemon is a program that is not explicitly invoked by the user and that stays in the background, waiting for a certain condition to be met before performing a task. Many server programs are daemons, a term that explains that the letter “d” is frequently present at the end of their name (<code class="command">sshd</code>, <code class="command">smtpd</code>, <code class="command">httpd</code>, etc.).
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Any preventive operation begins by regularly consulting the most relevant server logs. You can thus diagnose problems before they are even reported by disgruntled users. Indeed users may sometimes wait for a problem to reoccur over several days before reporting it. You can use a specific tool to analyze the content of the larger log files. You can find such utilities for web servers (such as <code class="command">analog</code>, <code class="command">awstats</code>, <code class="command">webalizer</code> for Apache), for FTP servers, for proxy/cache servers, for firewalls, for e-mail servers, for DNS servers, and even for print servers. Some of these utilities operate in a modular manner and allow analysis of several types of log files. This is the case of <code class="command">lire</code> or also <code class="command">modlogan</code>. Other tools, such as <code class="command">logcheck</code> (a software discussed in <a class="xref" href="security.html">Chapter 14, <em>Security</em></a>), scan these files to search for alerts to be dealt with.

				If your various searches haven't helped you to get to the root of a problem, it is possible to get help from other, perhaps more experienced people. This is indeed the purpose of the <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-user@lists.debian.org">debian-user@lists.debian.org</a></code> mailing list. As with any community, it has rules that need to be followed. Before asking any question, you should check that your problem isn't already covered by recent discussions on the list or by any official documentation. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMailingLists">http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMailingLists</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/">http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/</a></div>
			</div><a id="idp12997776" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp12998416" class="indexterm"></a><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>TIP</em></span> Reading a list on the Web</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				For high volume mailing lists, such as <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-user@lists.debian.org">debian-user@lists.debian.org</a></code>, it may be worthwhile to go through them as a discussion forum (or newsgroup). Gmane.org allows consultation of the Debian lists in this format. The list mentioned above is available at: <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.user">http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.user</a></div>
			</div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> Netiquette applies</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				In general, for all correspondence on e-mail lists, the rules of Netiquette should be followed. This term refers to a set of common sense rules, from common courtesy to mistakes that should be avoided. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855</a></div> <a id="idp13002032" class="indexterm"></a>
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Once you have met those two conditions, you can think of describing your problem to the mailing list. Include as much relevant information as possible: various tests conducted, documentation consulted, how you attempted to diagnose the problem, the packages concerned or those that may be involved, etc. Check the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS, described in sidebar <a class="xref" href="sect.debian-internals.html#cadre.bts"><span class="emphasis"><em>TOOL</em></span> Bug tracking system</a>) for similar problems, and mention the results of that search, providing links to bugs found. BTS starts on: <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/index.html">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/index.html</a></div>
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The more courteous and precise you have been, the greater your chances are of getting an answer, or, at least, some elements of response. If you receive relevant information by private e-mail, think of summarizing this information publicly so that others can benefit. Allow the list's archives, searched through various search engines, to show the resolution for others who may have the same question.
			</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp13004864">7.2.4. Reporting a Bug When a Problem Is Too Difficult</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp13005304" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp13005768" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				If all of your efforts to resolve a problem fail, it is possible that a resolution is not your responsibility, and that the problem is due to a bug in the program. In this case, the proper procedure is to report the bug to Debian or directly to the upstream developers. To do this, isolate the problem as much as possible and create a minimal test situation in which it can be reproduced. If you know which program is the apparent cause of the problem, you can find its corresponding package using the command, <code class="command">dpkg -S <em class="replaceable"><code>file_in_question</code></em></code>. Check the Bug Tracking System (<code class="literal">http://bugs.debian.org/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em></code>) to ensure that the bug has not already been reported. You can then send your own bug report, using the <code class="command">reportbug</code> command, including as much information as possible, especially a complete description of those minimal test cases that will allow anyone to recreate the bug.
