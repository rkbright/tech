				Debian developers have various responsibilities, and as official project members, they have great influence on the direction the project takes. A Debian developer is generally responsible for at least one package, but according to their available time and desire, they are free to become involved in numerous teams, acquiring, thus, more responsibilities within the project. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/people">http://www.debian.org/devel/people</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/intro/organization">http://www.debian.org/intro/organization</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams">http://wiki.debian.org/Teams</a></div>

				Debian has a database including all developers registered with the project, and their relevant information (address, telephone, geographical coordinates such as longitude and latitude, etc.). Some information (first and last name, country, username within the project, IRC username, GnuPG key, etc.) are public and available on the Web. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://db.debian.org/">http://db.debian.org/</a></div>
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The geographical coordinates allow the creation of a map locating all of the developers around the globe. Debian is truly an international project: Its developers can be found an all continents, although the majority are in the West.

				Package maintenance is a relatively regimented activity, very documented or even regulated. It must, in effect, respect all of the standards established by the <span class="emphasis"><em>Debian Policy</em></span>. Fortunately, there many tools that facilitate the maintainer's work. The developer can, thus, focus on the specifics of their package and on more complex tasks, such as squashing bugs. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/</a></div>

				Maintaining a package entails, first, “packaging” a program. Specifically, this means to define the means of installation so that, once installed, this program will operate and comply with all of the rules the Debian project sets for itself. The result of this operation is saved in a <code class="filename">.deb</code> file. Effective installation of the program will then require nothing more than extraction of this compressed archive and execution of some pre-installation or post-installation scripts contained therein.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				After this initial phase, the maintenance cycle truly begins: preparation of updates to follow the latest version of the Debian Policy, fixing bugs reported by users, inclusion of a new “upstream” version of the program, which naturally continues to develop simultaneously (e.g. at the time of the initial packaging, the program was at version 1.2.3. After some months of development, the original authors release a new stable version, numbered version 1.4.0. At this point, the Debian maintainer should update the package, so that users can benefit from its latest stable version).

				The Policy, an essential element of the Debian Project, establishes the norms ensuring both the quality of the packages and perfect interoperability of the distribution. Thanks to this Policy, Debian remains consistent despite its gigantic size. This Policy is not fixed in stone, but continuously evolves thanks to proposals formulated on the <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-policy@lists.debian.org">debian-policy@lists.debian.org</a></code> mailing list. Amendments that are approved by all are accepted and applied to the text by a small group of maintainers who have no editorial responsibility (they only include the modifications agreed upon by the Debian developers that are members of the above-mentioned list). You can read current amendment proposals on the bug tracking system: <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://bugs.debian.org/debian-policy">http://bugs.debian.org/debian-policy</a></div>

				Anyone can propose an amendment to the Debian Policy just by submitting a bug report with a severity level of “wishlist” against the <span class="pkg pkg">debian-policy</span> package. The process that then starts is documented in <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/debian-policy/Process.html</code>: If it is acknowledged that the problem revealed must be resolved by creating a new rule in the Debian Policy, discussion thereof then begins on the <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-policy@lists.debian.org">debian-policy@lists.debian.org</a></code> mailing list until a consensus is reached and a proposal issued. Someone then drafts the desired amendment and submits it for approval (in the form of a patch to review). As soon as two other developers approve the fact that the proposed amendment reflects the consensus reached in the previous discussion (they “second” it), the proposal can be included in the official document by one of the <span class="pkg pkg">debian-policy</span> package maintainers. If the process fails at one of these steps, the maintainers close the bug, classifying the proposal as rejected.

				Documentation for each package is stored in <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>/</code>. This directory often contains a <code class="filename">README.Debian</code> file describing the Debian specific adjustments made by the package maintainer. It is, thus, wise to read this file prior to any configuration, in order to benefit from their experience. We also find a <code class="filename">changelog.Debian.gz</code> file describing the changes made from one version to the next by the Debian maintainer. This is not to be confused with the <code class="filename">changelog.gz</code> file (or equivalent), which describes the changes made by the upstream developers. The <code class="filename">copyright</code> file includes information about the authors and the license covering the software. Finally, we may also find a file named <code class="filename">NEWS.Debian.gz</code>, which allows the Debian developer to communicate important information regarding updates (if <span class="emphasis"><em>apt-listchanges</em></span> is used, the messages are automatically shown by apt). All other files are specific to the software in question. We especially like to point out the <code class="filename">examples</code> sub-directory, which frequently contains examples of configuration files.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The Policy covers very well the technical aspects of packaging. The size of the project also raises organizational problems; these are dealt with by the Debian Constitution, which establishes a structure and means for decision making.
			</div><a id="idp3797416" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3797880" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3798344" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3798824" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3799544" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				This constitution defines a certain number of roles and positions, plus responsibilities and authorities for each. It is particularly worth noting that Debian developers always have ultimate decision making authority by a vote of general resolution, wherein a qualified majority of three quarters (75%) of votes is required for significant alterations to be made (such as those with an impact on the Foundation Documents). However, developers annually elect a “leader” to represent them in meetings, and ensure internal coordination between varying teams. This election is always a period of intense discussions. This leader's role is not formally defined by any document: candidates for this post usually propose their own definition of the position. In practice, the leader's roles include serving as a representative to the media, coordinating between “internal” teams, and providing overall guidance to the project, within which the developers can relate: the views of the DPL are implicitly approved by the majority of project members.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Specifically, the leader has real authority; his vote resolves tie votes; he can make any decision which is not already under the authority of someone else and can delegate part of his responsibilities.
			</div><a id="idp3801992" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6825760" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6826224" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6826688" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6827152" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6827616" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6828080" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6828544" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6829008" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6829472" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6829936" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6830400" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				Since its inception, the project has been successively lead by Ian Murdock, Bruce Perens, Ian Jackson, Wichert Akkerman, Ben Collins, Bdale Garbee, Martin Michlmayr, Branden Robinson, Anthony Towns, Sam Hocevar, Steve McIntyre and Stefano Zacchiroli.
			</div><a id="idp6831352" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				The constitution also defines a “technical committee”. This committee's essential role is to decide on technical matters when the developers involved have not reached an agreement between themselves. Otherwise, this committee plays an advisory role for any developer who fails to make a decision for which they are responsible. It is important to note that they only get involved when invited to do so by one of the parties in question.
			</div><a id="idp6832496" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				Finally, the constitution defines the position of “project secretary”, who is in charge of the organization of votes related to the various elections and general resolutions.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The “general resolution” procedure is fully detailed in the constitution, from the initial discussion period to the final counting of votes. For further details see: <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution.en.html">http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution.en.html</a></div>

				A “flamewar” is an exceedingly impassioned debate, which frequently ends up with people attacking each other once all reasonable argumentation has been exhausted on both sides. Certain themes are more frequently subject to polemics than others (for example, the choice of text editor, “do you prefer <code class="command">vi</code> or <code class="command">emacs</code>?”). The matters often provoke very rapid e-mail exchanges due to the sheer number of people with an opinion on the matter (everyone) and the very personal nature of such questions.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Nothing particularly useful generally comes from such discussions; stay out of such debates, and rapidly skim through their content. Full reading would be too time-consuming.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Even if this constitution establishes a semblance of democracy, the daily reality is quite different: Debian naturally follows the free software rules of the do-ocracy: it's the one who does, who gets to decide. A lot of time can be wasted debating the respective merits of various ways to approach a problem; the chosen solution will be the first functional and satisfying one... honoring the time that a competent person did put into it.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				This is the only way to earns one's stripes: do something useful and show that one has worked well. Many Debian “administrative” teams operate by appointment, preferring volunteers who have already effectively contributed and proved their competence. This method is practical, because the most of the work these teams do is public, therefore, accessible to any interested developer. This is why Debian is often described as a “meritocracy”.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>CULTURE</em></span> Meritocracy, the reign of knowledge</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp6840328" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				Meritocracy is a form of government in which authority is exercised by those with the greatest merit. For Debian, merit is a measure of competence, which is, itself, assessed by observation of past actions by one or more others within the project (Stefano Zacchiroli, the current project leader, speaks of “do-ocracy”, meaning “power to those who get things done”). Their simple existence proves a certain level of competence; their achievements generally being free software, with available source code, which can easily be reviewed by peers to assess their quality.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				This effective operational method guarantees the quality of contributors in the “key” Debian teams. This method is by no means perfect and occasionally there are those who do not accept this way of operating. The selection of developers accepted in the teams may appear a bit arbitrary, or even unfair. Furthermore, not everybody has the same definition of the service expected from these teams. For some, it is unacceptable to have to wait eight days for inclusion of a new Debian package, while others will wait patiently for three weeks without a problem. As such, there are regular complaints from the disgruntled about the “quality of service” from some teams.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>COMMUNITY</em></span> Integration of new maintainers</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp6843200" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				The team in charge of admitting new developers is the most regularly criticized. One must acknowledge that, throughout the years, the Debian project has become more and more demanding of the developers that it will accept. Some people may see some injustice in that, but we must confess that, what were only little challenges at the beginning have become much greater in a community of over 1,000 people, when it comes to ensuring the quality and integrity of everything that Debian produces for its users.
			</div><a id="idp6844648" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6845128" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6845592" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				Furthermore, the acceptance procedure is concluded by review of the candidacy by a small team, the Debian Account Managers. These managers are, thus, particularly exposed to criticism, since they have final say in the inclusion or rejection of a volunteer within the Debian developers community. In practice, sometimes they must delay the acceptance of a person until they have learned more about the operations of the project. One can, of course, contribute to Debian before being accepted as an official developer, by being sponsored by current developers.

				Is it relevant to mention the users among those who work within the Debian project? Yes: They play a critical role in the project. Far from being “passive”, some of our users run development versions of Debian and regularly file bug reports to indicate problems. Others go even further and submit improvements ideas, by filing a bug report with a severity level of “wishlist”, or even submit corrections to the source code, called “patches” (see sidebar <a class="xref" href="sect.debian-internals.html#cadre.patch"><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> Patch, how to send a fix</a>).
			</div><div class="sidebar important"><a xmlns="" id="cadre.bts"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>TOOL</em></span> Bug tracking system</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp6849296" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6850000" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6850480" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6850944" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				The Debian Bug Tracking System (Debian BTS) envelopes the project. The public part of the web interface allows users to view all bugs reported, with the option to display a sorted list of bugs selected according to various criteria, such as: affected package, severity, status, address of the reporter, address of the maintainer in charge of it, tag, etc. It is also possible to browse the complete historical listing of all discussions regarding each of the bugs.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Below the surface, the Debian BTS communicates via e-mail: all information that it stores come from messages sent by the various persons involved. Any e-mail sent to <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:12345@bugs.debian.org">12345@bugs.debian.org</a></code> will, thus, be assigned to the history for bug no. 12345. Authorized persons may “close” a bug by writing a message describing the reasons for the decision to close to <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:12345-done@bugs.debian.org">12345-done@bugs.debian.org</a></code> (a bug is closed when the indicated problem is resolved or no longer relevant). A new bug is reported by sending an e-mail to <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:submit@bugs.debian.org">submit@bugs.debian.org</a></code> according to a specific format which identifies the package in question. The address <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:control@bugs.debian.org">control@bugs.debian.org</a></code> allows editing of all the “meta-information” related to a bug.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Debian BTS has other functional features, as well, such as the use of tags for labeling bugs. For more information, see <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/</a></div>

				The severity of a bug formally assigns a degree of gravity to the problem indicated. Effectively, not all bugs have the same importance; for instance, a typing error in a man page is not comparable to a security vulnerability in server software.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Debian uses an extended severity scale to precisely indicate the severity of a bug. Each level is defined precisely in order to facilitate the selection thereof. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities</a></div>
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Additionally, numerous satisfied users of the service offered by Debian like to make a contribution of their own to the project. As not everyone has appropriate levels of expertise in programming, they choose, perhaps, to assist with the translation and review of documentation. There are language-specific mailing lists for various languages. For French, for instance, it is <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-l10n-french@lists.debian.org">debian-l10n-french@lists.debian.org</a></code>. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/intl/french/">http://www.debian.org/intl/french/</a></div>

				“i18n” and “l10n” are the abbreviations for the words “internationalization” and “localization”, respectively, preserving the initial and last letter of each word, and the number of letters in the middle.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				To “internationalize” a program consists of modifying it so that it can be translated (localized). This involves partially rewriting a program initially written to work in one language in order to be able to open it to all languages.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				To “localize” a program consists of translating the original messages (frequently in English) to another language. For this, it must have already been internationalized.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				In summary, internationalization prepares the software for translation, which is then executed by localization.

				A patch is a file describing changes to be made to one or more reference files. Specifically, it will contain a list of lines to be removed or added to the code, as well as (sometimes) lines taken from the reference text, replacing the modifications in context (they allow identification of the placement of the changes if the line numbers have been changed).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The tool used for applying the modifications given in such a file is simply called <code class="command">patch</code>. The tool that creates it is called <code class="command">diff</code>, and is used as follows:

				The <code class="filename">file.patch</code> file contains the instructions for changing the content of <code class="filename">file.old</code> into <code class="filename">file.new</code>. We can send it to someone, who can then use it to recreate <code class="filename">file.new</code> from the two others, like this:
			</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>patch -p0 file.old &lt;file.patch</code></strong></pre><div class="para"><p></p>

				The <code class="command">reportbug</code> tool facilitates sending bug reports on a Debian package. It can check to make sure the bug in question hasn't already been filed, thus prevent redundancy in the system. It reminds the user of the definitions of the severity levels, for reporting to be as accurate as possible (the developer can always fine-tune these parameters later, if needed). It helps to write a complete bug report without the user needing to know the precise syntax, by writing it and allowing the user to edit it. This report will then be sent via an e-mail server (local, by default, but <code class="command">reportbug</code> can also use a remote server).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				This tool first targets the development versions, only concerned with the resolution of bugs. A stable version of Debian is, in effect, written in stone, with the exception of security updates or other important updates (if, for example, a package is not working at all). A correction of a minor bug in a Debian package must, thus, wait for the next stable version.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				All of these mechanisms are accentuated by user behavior. Far from being isolated, they are a true community within which numerous exchanges take place. We especially note that impressive activity on the user discussion mailing list, <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-user@lists.debian.org">debian-user@lists.debian.org</a></code> (<a class="xref" href="solving-problems.html">Chapter 7, <em>Solving Problems and Finding Relevant Information</em></a> discusses this in greater detail).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Not only do users help themselves on technical issues that directly affect them, but they also discuss the best ways to contribute to the Debian project and help it move forward — discussions that frequently result in suggestions for improvements.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Since Debian does not expend funds on any self-promoting marketing campaigns, its users play an essential role in its diffusion, ensuring its notoriety via word-of-mouth.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				This method functions quite well, since Debian fans are found at all levels of the free software community: from install parties (workshops where seasoned users assist newcomers to install the system) organized by local LUGs or “Linux User Groups”, to association booths at large tech conventions dealing with Linux, etc.

				Debian is organized immediately around the concept of source packages, each with its maintainer or group of maintainers. Numerous work teams have slowly appeared, ensuring administration of the infrastructure, management of tasks not specific to any package in particular (quality assurance, Debian Policy, installer, etc.), with the latest teams growing up around sub-projects.

					To each their own Debian! A sub-project is a group of volunteers interested in adapting Debian to specific needs. Beyond the selection of a sub-group of programs intended for a particular domain (education, medicine, multimedia creation, etc.), this also involves improving existing packages, packaging missing software, adapting the installer, creating specific documentation, and more.
				</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>VOCABULARY</em></span> Sub-project and derivative distribution</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp6883848" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp6884328" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					The development process for a derivative distribution consists in starting with a particular version of Debian and making a number of modifications to it. The infrastructure used for this work is completely external to the Debian project. There isn't necessarily a policy for contributing improvements. This difference explains how a derivative distribution may “diverge” from its origins, and why they have to regularly resynchronize with their source in order to benefit from improvements made upstream.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					On the other hand, a sub-project can not diverge, since all the work on it consists of directly improving Debian in order to adapt it to a specific goal.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The most known distribution derived from Debian is, without a doubt, Ubuntu, but there are many. See <a class="xref" href="derivative-distributions.html">Appendix A, <em>Derivative Distributions</em></a> to learn about their particularities and their positioning in relationship to Debian.
				</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Here is a small selection of current sub-projects:
				</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							Debian-Junior, by Ben Armstrong, offering an appealing and easy to use Debian system for children;

						</div></li></ul></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					This list will most likely continue to grow with time and improved perception of the advantages of Debian sub-projects. Fully supported by the existing Debian infrastructure, they can, in effect, focus on work with real added value, without worrying about remaining synchronized with Debian, since they are developed within the project.

					Debian-Edu was, initially, a French project, created by Stéphane Casset and Raphaël Hertzog, within the company, Logidée, on behalf of a pedagogical documentation departmental center. Raphaël then integrated it with Debian as a sub-project. Due to time constraints, it has not progressed further, as is often the case with free software projects lacking contributors.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Likewise, a team of Norwegians worked on a similar distribution, also based on the <code class="command">debian-installer</code>. SkoleLinux's progress being significant, Raphaël suggested that it become part of the Debian family and to take over the Debian-Edu sub-project.

					Agnula was a European project, managed under the direction of an Italian team. It entailed, for the “DeMuDi” part, the development of a version of Debian dedicated to multimedia applications. Certain members of the project, especially Marco Trevisani, wanted to perpetuate it by integrating it within the Debian Project. The Debian-Multimedia sub-project was born. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMultimedia">http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMultimedia</a></div>

					The project, however, had difficulty in forging an identity and taking off. Free Ekanayaka did the work within Debian, but offered the results under the form of a derivative distribution, which is now known as 64Studio.

					The ftpmasters are in charge of the official archive of Debian packages. They maintain the program that receives packages sent by developers and automatically installs them, after some checks, on the reference server (<code class="literal">ftp-master.debian.org</code>).
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					They must also verify the licenses of all new packages, in order to ensure that Debian may distribute them, prior to including them in the corpus of existing packages.

					The bug tracking system, initially designed to associate bug reports with a Debian package, has proved very practical to manage other matters: lists of problems to be resolved or tasks to manage without any link to a particular Debian package. The “pseudo-packages” allow, thus, certain teams to use the bug tracking system without associating a real package with their team. Everyone can, thus, report issues that needs to be dealt with. The BTS has an entry <span class="emphasis"><em>ftp.debian.org</em></span> to report problems on the official package archive or simply to request removal of a package. Likewise, the pseudo-package <span class="emphasis"><em>www.debian.org</em></span> refers to errors on the Debian website, and <span class="emphasis"><em>lists.debian.org</em></span> gathers all the problems concerning the mailing lists.

					FusionForge is a program that enables creation of sites similar to <code class="literal">www.sourceforge.net</code>, <code class="literal">alioth.debian.org</code>, or even <code class="literal">savannah.gnu.org</code>. It hosts projects and provides a range of services that facilitate collaborative development.

				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					<code class="literal">alioth.debian.org</code> is Debian's FusionForge server, administered by Roland Mas, Tollef Fog Heen, Stephen Gran, and Christian Bayle.

					This is one of Raphaël's creations. The basic idea is, for a given package, to centralize as much information as possible on a single page. Thus, one can quickly check the status of a program, identify tasks to be completed, and offer one's assistance. This is why this page gathers all bug statistics, available versions in each distribution, progress of a package in the <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> distribution, the status of translations of descriptions and debconf templates, the eventual availability of a new upstream version, notices of noncompliance with the latest version of the Debian Policy, information on the maintainer, and any other information that said maintainer wishes to include. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/">http://packages.qa.debian.org/</a></div>

					Advanced users can, thus, follow all of this information closely and even contribute to the project, once they've got a good enough understanding of how it works.

					Another web interface, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Debian Developer's Packages Overview</em></span> (DDPO), provides each developer a synopsis of the status of all Debian packages placed under their charge. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php">http://qa.debian.org/developer.php</a></div>

					The mailing lists are, without a doubt, the best testimony to activity on a project, since they keep track of everything that happens. Some statistics (from 2007) regarding our mailing lists speak for themselves: Debian hosts more than 180 lists, totaling 175,000 individual subscriptions. The 45,000 messages sent each month generate 1 million e-mails daily.
				</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Each specific service has its own system administration team, generally composed of volunteers who have installed it (and also frequently programmed the corresponding tools themselves). This is the case of the bug tracking system (BTS), the package tracking system (PTS), <code class="literal">alioth.debian.org</code> (FusionForge server, see sidebar), the services available on <code class="literal">qa.debian.org</code>, <code class="literal">lintian.debian.org</code>, <code class="literal">buildd.debian.org</code>, <code class="literal">cdimage.debian.org</code>, etc.

					Unlike administrative teams, the development teams are rather widely open, even to outside contributors. Even if Debian does not have a vocation to create software, the project needs some specific programs to meet its goals. Of course, developed under a free software license, these tools make use of methods proven elsewhere in the free software world.
				</div><div class="sidebar"><a xmlns="" id="cadre-cvs"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>CULTURE</em></span> CVS</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp3082024" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3082488" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3082968" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a tool for collaborative work on multiple files, while maintaining a history of modifications. The files in question are generally text files, such as a program's source code. If several people work together on the same file, <code class="command">cvs</code> can only merge the alterations made if they were made to different portions of the file. Otherwise, these “conflicts” must be resolved by hand. This system manages modifications, line by line, by storing diff patches from one version to another.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					CVS uses a central archive (called a CVS repository) to store files and the history of their modifications (each revision is recorded in the form of a <span class="emphasis"><em>diff</em></span> patch file, intended to be used on the prior version). Everyone checks out a particular version (working copy) to work on. The tool allows one to view the modifications made to the working copy (<code class="command">cvs diff</code>), to record them in the central repository by creating a new entry in the versions history (<code class="command">cvs commit</code>), to update the working copy to include modifications made in parallel by other uses (<code class="command">cvs update</code>), and to record a particular configuration in the history in order to be able to easily extract it later on (<code class="command">cvs tag</code>).
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					<code class="command">CVS</code> experts will know how to handle multiple concurrent versions of a project in development without them interfering with each other. These versions are called <span class="emphasis"><em>branches</em></span>. This metaphor of a tree is fairly accurate, since a program is initially developed on a common trunk. When a milestone has been reached (such as version 1.0), development continues on two branches: the development branch prepares the next major release, and the maintenance branch manages updates and fixes for version 1.0.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					<code class="command">cvs</code>, however, does have some limitations. It is unable to manage symbolic links, changes in file or directory names, the deletion of directories, etc. It has contributed to the appearance of more modern, and free alternatives which have filled in most of these gaps. These include, especially, <code class="command">subversion</code> (<code class="command">svn</code>), <code class="command">git</code>, <code class="command">bazaar</code> (<code class="command">bzr</code>), and <code class="command">mercurial</code> (<code class="command">hg</code>). <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">http://bazaar-vcs.org/</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">http://mercurial.selenic.com/</a></div>

					Debian has developed little software of its own, but certain programs have assumed a starring role, and their fame has spread beyond the scope of the project. Good examples are <code class="command">dpkg</code>, the Debian package management program (it is, in fact, an abbreviation of Debian PacKaGe), and <code class="command">apt</code>, a tool to automatically install any Debian package, and its dependencies, guaranteeing the cohesion of the system after upgrade (its name is an acronym for Advanced Package Tool). Their teams are, however, much smaller, since a rather high level of programming skill is required for overall understanding of the operations of these types of programs.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The most important team is probably that for the Debian installation program, <code class="command">debian-installer</code>, which has accomplished a work of momentous proportions since its conception in 2001. Numerous contributors were needed, since it is difficult to write a single program able to install Debian on a dozen different architectures. Each one has its own mechanism for booting and its own bootloader. All of this work is coordinated on the <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a></code> mailing list, under the direction of Otavio Salvador and Joey Hess. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_retrospective/">http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_retrospective/</a></div>
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The <code class="command">debian-cd</code> program team, very small, has an even more modest objective. Many “small” contributors are responsible for their architecture, since the main developer can not know all the subtleties, nor the exact way to start the installer from the CD-ROM.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Many teams must collaborate with others in the activity of packaging: <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-qa@lists.debian.org">debian-qa@lists.debian.org</a></code> tries, for example, to ensure quality at all levels of the Debian project. The <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-policy@lists.debian.org">debian-policy@lists.debian.org</a></code> list develops Debian Policy according to proposals from all over the place. The teams in charge of each architecture (<code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-architecture@lists.debian.org">debian-<em class="replaceable"><code>architecture</code></em>@lists.debian.org</a></code>) compile all packages, adapting them to their particular architecture, if needed.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Other teams manage the most important packages in order to ensure maintenance without placing too heavy a load on a single pair of shoulders; this is the case with the C library and <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-glibc@lists.debian.org">debian-glibc@lists.debian.org</a></code>, the C compiler on the <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-gcc@lists.debian.org">debian-gcc@lists.debian.org</a></code> list, or Xorg on the <code class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:debian-x@lists.debian.org">debian-x@lists.debian.org</a></code> (this group is also known as the X Strike Force, coordinated by Cyril Brulebois).
