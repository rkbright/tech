			<a id="idp5439176" class="indexterm"></a>
			 Some years after its initial launch, Debian formalized the principles that it should follow as a free software project. This activist step allows orderly and peaceful growth by ensuring that all members progress in the same direction. To become a Debian developer, any candidate must confirm and prove their support and adherence to the principles established in the project's Foundation Documents.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			The development process is constantly debated, but these Foundation Documents are widely and consensually supported, thus rarely change. The Debian constitution also offers other guarantees: a qualified majority of three quarters is required to approve any amendment.
		</div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section.contrat-social">1.2.1. The Commitment towards Users</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp5441184" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp5441648" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				The project also has a “social contract”. What place does such a text have in a project only intended for the development of an operating system? That is quite simple: Debian works for its users, and thus, by extension, for society. This contract summarizes the commitments that the project undertakes. Let us study them in greater detail:
			</div><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						Debian will remain 100% free.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						This is Rule No. 1. Debian is and will remain composed entirely and exclusively of free software. Additionally, all software development within the Debian project, itself, will be free.
					</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>PERSPECTIVE</em></span> Beyond software</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
						The first version of the Debian Social Contract said “Debian Will Remain 100% Free <span class="emphasis"><em>Software</em></span>”. The disappearance of this word (with the ratification of Version 1.1 of the contract in April of 2004) indicates the will to achieve freedom, not only in software, but also in the documentation and any other element that Debian wishes to provide within its operating system.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						This change, which was only intended as editorial, has, in reality, had numerous consequences, especially with the removal of some problematic documentation. Furthermore, the increasing use of firmware in drivers poses problems: frequently non-free, they are, nonetheless, necessary for proper operation of the corresponding hardware.
					</div></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						We will give back to the free software community.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Any improvement contributed by the Debian project to a program integrated in the distribution is sent back to the author of the program (called “upstream”). In general, Debian will cooperate with the community rather than work in isolation.
					</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>COMMUNITY</em></span> Upstream author, or Debian developer?</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp5447288" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10178360" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10178824" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
						The term “upstream author” means the author(s)/developer(s) of a program, those who write and develop it. On the other hand, a “Debian developer” works with an existing program to make it into a Debian package (the term “Debian maintainer” is better suited).
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Frequently, the line of demarcation is not clear. The Debian maintainer may write a patch, which benefits all users of the software. In general, Debian encourages those in charge of a package in Debian to get involved in “upstream” development as well (they become, then, contributors, without being confined to the simple role of users of a program).
					</div></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						We will not hide problems.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Debian is not perfect, and, we will find new problems to fix every day. We will keep our entire bug report database open for public view at all times. Reports that people file on-line will promptly become visible to others.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						Our priorities are our users and free software.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						This commitment is more difficult to define. Debian imposes, thus, a bias when a decision must be made, and will discard an easy solution for the developers that will jeopardize the user experience, opting for a more elegant solution, even if it is more difficult to implement. This means to take into account, as a priority, the interests of the users and free software.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						Works that do not meet our free software standards.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Debian accepts and understands that users often want to use some non-free programs. The project, thus, has made part of its infrastructure available to them, in order to distribute as Debian packages software that authorizes it.
					</div><div class="sidebar important"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>COMMUNITY</em></span> For or against the non-free section?</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp10184288" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10184768" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
						The commitment to maintain a structure to accommodate non-free software (i.e. the “non-free” section, see the sidebar <a class="xref" href="apt.html#cadre-sections"><span class="emphasis"><em>VOCABULARY</em></span> The <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">main</em></span>, <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">contrib</em></span> and <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">non-free</em></span> archives</a>) is frequently a subject of debate within the Debian community.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Detractors argue that it turns people away from free software equivalents, and contradicts the principle of serving only the free software cause. Supporters flatly state that most of the non-free packages are “nearly free”, and held back by only one or two annoying restrictions (the most common being the prohibition against commercial usage of the software). By distributing these programs in the non-free branch, we indirectly explain to the author that their creation would be better known and more widely used if they could be included in the main section. They are, thus, politely invited to alter their license to serve this purpose.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						After a first, unfruitful attempt in 2004, the complete removal of the non-free section should not return to the agenda for several years, especially since it contains many useful documents that were moved simply because they did not meet the new requirements for the main section. This is especially the case for certain software documentation files issued by the GNU project (in particular, Emacs and Make).
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						The existence of the non-free section particularly annoys the Free Software Foundation, causing it, thus, to refuse to officially recommend Debian as an operating system.
					</div></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section.dfsg">1.2.2. The Debian Free Software Guidelines</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp10189048" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10189512" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10189992" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp10190496" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				This reference document defines which software is “free enough” to be included in Debian. If a program's license is in accord with these principles, it can be included in the main section; on the contrary, and provided that free distribution is permitted, it may be found in the non-free section. The non-free section is not officially part of Debian; it is an added service provided to users.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				More than a selection criteria for Debian, this text has become an authority on the subject of free software, and has served as the basis for the “Open Source definition”. It is, thus, historically one of the first formalizations of the concept of “free software”.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The GNU General Public License, the BSD License, and the Artistic License are examples of traditional free licenses that follow the 9 points mentioned in this text. Below you will find the text as it is published on the Debian website. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines</a></div>
			</div><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp10193664"></a>Free redistribution.</h5>
							The license of a Debian component may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license may not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.
						</div><div class="sidebar important"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> Free licenses</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp1141216" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1141936" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1142416" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1143136" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1143616" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1144320" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1144784" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp1145504" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
						The GNU GPL, the BSD license, and the Artistic License all comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, even though they are very different.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						The GNU GPL, used and promoted by the FSF (Free Software Foundation), is the most common. A particular feature thereof is that any redistributed program or work derived from a program incorporating or using GPL code, can only be distributed according to its terms. It prohibits, thus, any reuse in a proprietary application. This poses serious problems for the reuse of GPL code in free software incompatible with this license. As such, it is sometimes impossible to link a program published under another free software license with a library distributed under the GPL. On the other hand, this license is very solid in American law: FSF lawyers have participated in the drafting thereof, and have often forced violators to reach an amicable agreement with the FSF without going to court. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a></div>
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						The BSD license is the least restrictive: everything is permitted, including use of modified BSD code in a proprietary application. Microsoft even uses it, basing the TCP/IP layer of Windows NT on that of the BSD kernel. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</a></div>
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Finally, the Artistic License reaches a compromise between these two others: integration of code in a proprietary application is permitted, but any modification must be published. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0.php</a></div>
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						The complete text of these licenses is available in <code class="filename">/usr/share/common-licenses/</code> on any Debian system.
					</div></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp1150352"></a>Source code.</h5>

						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp1151408"></a>Derived works.</h5>

							The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> if the license allows the distribution of “patch files” with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software (<span class="emphasis"><em>This is a compromise.

						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp1154472"></a>No discrimination against persons or groups.</h5>

						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp1155552"></a>No discrimination against fields of endeavor.</h5>
							The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp3738528"></a>Distribution of license.</h5>

						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp3739640"></a>License must not be specific to Debian.</h5>
							The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the Debian system.
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="formalpara"><p></p><h5 class="formalpara"><a xmlns="" id="idp3740968"></a>License must not contaminate other software.</h5>
							The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be free software.
						</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> Copyleft</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp3742512" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3742992" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
						Copyleft is a principle that consists in using copyrights to guarantee the freedom of a work and its derivatives, rather than restrict the rights of uses, as is the case with proprietary software. It is, also, a play of words on the term “copyright”. Richard Stallman discovered the idea when a friend of his, fond of puns, wrote on an envelope addressed to him: “copyleft: all rights reversed”. Copyleft imposes preservation of all initial liberties upon distribution of an original or modified version of a program. It is, thus, not possible to distribute a program as proprietary software if it is derived from code from a copyleft released program.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						The copyleft license most known is, of course, the GNU GPL, and derivatives thereof, the GNU LGPL or GNU Lesser General Public License, and the GNU FDL or GNU Free Documentation License. Sadly, the copyleft licenses are generally incompatible with each other. Consequently, it is best to use only one of them.

				Bruce Perens, the second leader of the Debian project, just after Ian Murdock, was very controversial in his dynamic and authoritarian methods. He nevertheless remains an important contributor to Debian, to whom Debian is especially indebted for the editing of the famous “Debian Free Software Guidelines” (DFSG), an original idea of Ean Schuessler. Subsequently, Bruce would derive from it the famous “Open Source Definition”, removing all references to Debian from it. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a></div>
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				His departure from the project was quite emotional, but Bruce has remained strongly attached to Debian, since he continues to promote this distribution in political and economic spheres. He still sporadically appears on the e-mail lists to give his advice and present his latests initiatives in favor of Debian.

				Last anecdotal point, it was Bruce who was responsible for inspiring the different “codenames” for Debian versions (1.1 — <span class="distribution distribution">Rex</span>, 1.2 — <span class="distribution distribution">Buzz</span>, 1.3 — <span class="distribution distribution">Bo</span>, 2.0 — <span class="distribution distribution">Hamm</span>, 2.1 — <span class="distribution distribution">Slink</span>, 2.2 — <span class="distribution distribution">Potato</span>, 3.0 — <span class="distribution distribution">Woody</span>, 3.1 — <span class="distribution distribution">Sarge</span>, 4.0 — <span class="distribution distribution">Etch</span>, 5.0 — <span class="distribution distribution">Lenny</span>, 6.0 — <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span>, <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> — <span class="distribution distribution">Wheezy</span>, <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> — <span class="distribution distribution">Sid</span>). They are taken from the names of characters in the Toy Story movie. This animated film entirely composed of computer graphics was produced by Pixar Studios, with whom Bruce was employed at the time that he lead the Debian project. The name “Sid” holds particular status, since it will eternally be associated with the <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> branch. In the film, this character was the neighbor child, who was always breaking toys — so beware of getting too close to <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span>. Otherwise, <span class="distribution distribution">Sid</span> is also an acronym for “Still In Development”.
